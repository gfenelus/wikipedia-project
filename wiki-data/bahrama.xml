Brahma is commonly depicted as a red or golden-[[complexion]]ed bearded man with four heads and hands. His four heads represent the four Vedas and are pointed to the four cardinal directions. He is seated on a lotus and his ''[[vahana]]'' (mount) is a ''[[hamsa (bird)|hamsa]]'' (swan, goose or crane). According to the scriptures, Brahma created his children from his mind and thus, they are referred to as ''[[Manasputra|Manasaputra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87k0AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT936|title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths|last=Dalal|first=Roshen|author-link=Roshen Dalal|date=2014-04-18|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=9788184753967|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="turner258"&gt;Charles Coulter and Patricia Turner (2000), Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0786403172}}, page 258, Quote: "When Brahma is acknowledged as the supreme god, it was said that Kama sprang from his heart."&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary Hinduism, Brahma does not enjoy popular worship and has substantially less important than the other two members of the Trimurti. Brahma is revered in the ancient texts, yet rarely worshiped as a primary deity in India, owing to the absence of any significant sect dedicated to his reverence.&lt;ref name=morris123&gt;{{cite book|author-link1=Brian Morris (anthropologist)|first=Brian|last=Morris|year=2005|title=Religion and Anthropology: A Critical Introduction|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521852418|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few temples dedicated to him exist in India, the most famous being the [[Brahma Temple, Pushkar]] in Rajasthan.&lt;ref name=chakravarti15&gt;{{cite book|first=SS|last=Charkravarti|year=2001|title=Hinduism, a Way of Life|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-8120808997|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Brahma temples are found outside India, such as at the [[Erawan Shrine]] in [[Bangkok]].&lt;ref name=ellenlondon74&gt;{{cite book|first=Ellen|last=London|year=2008|title=Thailand Condensed: 2,000 Years of History &amp; Culture|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-9812615206|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and meaning==
The origins of the term {{IAST|brahmā}} are uncertain, partly because several related words are found in the Vedic literature, such as ''[[Brahman]]'' for the 'Ultimate Reality' and [[Brahmin|''Brāhmaṇa'']] for 'priest'. A distinction between the spiritual concept of ''brahman'' and the deity Brahmā is that the former is a genderless abstract metaphysical concept in Hinduism,&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, Brahman, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 122&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter is one of the many masculine gods in Hindu tradition.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, Brahma, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 119&lt;/ref&gt; The spiritual concept of ''brahman'' is quite old and some scholars suggest that the deity Brahma may have emerged as a personification and visible icon of the impersonal universal principle ''of brahman''.&lt;ref name="brucesullivan"&gt;Bruce Sullivan (1999), Seer of the Fifth Veda, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816763}}, pages 82-83&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of a distinct deity named ''Brahma'' is evidenced in late Vedic texts.&lt;ref name="brucesullivan" /&gt;

Grammatically, the nominal stem ''Brahma-'' has two distinct forms: the [[Neuter (grammar)|neuter]] noun ''bráhman'', whose [[nominative case|nominative singular form]] is ''{{IAST|brahma}}'' ({{lang|sa|ब्रह्म}}); and the [[Masculine (grammar)|masculine]] noun ''brahmán'', whose nominative singular form is ''{{IAST|brahmā}}'' ({{lang|sa|ब्रह्मा}}). The former, the neuter form, has a generalized and abstract meaning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gopal|first=Madan|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|title=India through the ages|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|year=1990|editor=K.S. Gautam|page=[https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada/page/79 79]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter, the masculine form, is used as the proper name of the deity Brahma.

One of the earliest mentions of Brahma with Vishnu and Shiva is in the fifth ''Prapathaka'' (lesson) of the ''[[Maitrayaniya Upanishad]]'', probably composed around the late 1st millennium BCE. Brahma is first discussed in verse 5,1,  also called the ''Kutsayana Hymn'', and then expounded in verse 5,2.&lt;ref name=hume51&gt;{{citation|first=Robert Ernest|last=Hume|author-link=Robert Ernest Hume|title=The Thirteen Principal Upanishads |url=https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n443/mode/2up|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1921|pages=422–424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the pantheistic ''Kutsayana Hymn'',&lt;ref name=hume51/&gt; the Upanishad asserts that one's Soul is Brahman, and this Ultimate Reality, Cosmic Universal or God is within each living being. It equates the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|''atman'']] (Soul, Self) within to be Brahma and various alternate manifestations of Brahman, as follows, "Thou art Brahma, thou art Vishnu, thou art Rudra (Shiva), thou art [[Agni]], [[Varuna]], [[Vayu]], [[Indra]], thou art All."&lt;ref name=hume51/&gt;

In verse (5,2), Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva are mapped into the theory of [[Guṇa]], that is qualities, psyche and innate tendencies the text describes can be found in all living beings.&lt;ref name=maxmuller51&gt;[[Max Müller|Max Muller]], The Upanishads, Part 2, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/302/mode/2up Maitrayana-Brahmana Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages 303-304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Gonda (1968), The Hindu Trinity, Anthropos, Vol. 63, pages 215-219&lt;/ref&gt; This chapter of the ''[[Maitri Upanishad]]'' asserts that the universe emerged from darkness (''[[Tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]''), first as passion characterized by innate quality (''[[rajas]]''), which then refined and differentiated into purity and goodness (''[[sattva]]'').&lt;ref name=hume51/&gt;&lt;ref name=maxmuller51/&gt; Of these three qualities, ''rajas'' are then mapped to ''Brahma'', as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 344-346&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Now then, that part of him which belongs to ''tamas'', that, O students of sacred knowledge ([[Brahmacharya|Brahmacharins]]), is this Rudra.
That part of him which belongs to ''rajas'', that O students of sacred knowledge, is this '''Brahma'''.
That part of him which belongs to ''sattva'', that O students of sacred knowledge, is this Vishnu.
Verily, that One became threefold, became eightfold, elevenfold, twelvefold, into infinite fold.
This Being (neuter) entered all beings, he became the overlord of all beings.
That is the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (Soul, Self) within and without – yea, within and without!
&lt;/poem&gt;
|[[Maitrayaniya Upanishad|Maitri Upanishad]] 5.2|&lt;ref name=hume51/&gt;&lt;ref name=maxmuller51/&gt;}}

While the ''Maitri Upanishad'' maps Brahma with one of the elements of ''the guṇa'' theory of Hinduism, the text does not depict him as one of the trifunctional elements of the Hindu ''Trimurti'' idea found in later Puranic literature.&lt;ref&gt;GM Bailey (1979), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269716 Trifunctional Elements in the theology of the Hindu Trimūrti], Numen, Vol. 26, Fasc. 2, pages 152-163&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Vedic, Epics and Puranas===
[[File:Sheshashayi Vishnu.jpg|thumb|upright|In [[Vaishnava]] Puranic scriptures, Brahma emerges on a lotus from Vishnu's navel as Vishnu (Mahavishnu) creates the cosmic cycle. Shaivite texts describe that Shiva told Vishnu to create, Shiva ordered Vishnu to make Brahma.&lt;ref name=bryant18/&gt;]]

During the post-Vedic period, Brahma was a prominent deity and his sect existed during the 2nd to 6th century CE. Early texts like [[Brahmananda Purana]] describe that there was nothing but an eternal ocean. From this, a golden egg called [[Hiranyagarbha]], emerged. The egg broke open and Brahma, who had created himself within it, came into existence (gaining the name [[Swayambhu]]). Then, he created the universe, the earth and other things. He also created people to populate and live on his creation.&lt;ref name = "ACK" &gt;{{Cite book|last=Srinivasan|first=Shalini|title=Stories of Creation|date=April 1971|publisher=Amar Chitra Katha private limited|isbn=8184826478}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Fall" &gt;{{Cite book|last=Achuthananda|first=Swami|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F9FqDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Brahma|title=The Ascent of Vishnu and the Fall of Brahma|date=2018-08-27|publisher=Relianz Communications Pty Ltd|isbn=978-0-9757883-3-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Dalal1" &gt;{{Cite book|last=Dalal|first=Roshen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;q=Brahma|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|date=2010|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|language=en|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by the 7th century, Brahma lost his importance. Puranic legends mention various reasons for his downfall. There are primarily two prominent versions of why Brahma lost his ground. The first version refers to Shiva Purana, where Brahma and Vishnu argued about who was the greatest among them. Then suddenly, they heard a voice and saw a huge lightning pillar. The voice asked them to find out the end of the pillar and whoever could find the end of the pillar would be the greatest. Vishnu went toward the bottom and Brahma went toward the top. Vishnu came back and accepted his defeat that he couldn't find the end. However, Brahma returned and lied that he could find the top end. The pillar was [[Shiva Linga]] and the voice was of Shiva and this lie infuriated Shiva. Angry Shiva cursed Brahma that he would never be worshiped henceforth.

Historians believe that some of the major reasons for Brahma's downfall were the rise of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, their replacement of him with Shakti in the Smarta tradition and the frequent attacks by Buddhists, Jains and even by Hindu followers of Vaishnavas and Shaivites.&lt;ref name="Dalal1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fall" /&gt;

The post-Vedic texts of Hinduism offer multiple theories of [[cosmogony]], many involving Brahma. These include ''Sarga'' (primary creation of the universe) and ''Visarga'' (secondary creation), ideas related to the Indian thought that there are two levels of reality, one primary that is unchanging ([[metaphysics|metaphysical]]) and other secondary that is always changing ([[empiricism|empirical]]), and that all observed reality of the latter is in an endlessly repeating cycle of existence, that cosmos and life we experience is continually created, evolved, dissolved and then re-created.&lt;ref name=tpinchman125&gt;Tracy Pintchman (1994), The Rise of the Goddess in the Hindu Tradition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791421123}}, pages 122-138&lt;/ref&gt; The primary creator is extensively discussed in Vedic cosmogonies with ''Brahman'' or ''[[Purusha]]'' or ''[[Devi]]'' among the terms used for the primary creator,&lt;ref name=tpinchman125/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Gonda (1969), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40457085 The Hindu Trinity], Anthropos, Bd 63/64, H 1/2, pages 213-214&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast the Vedic and post-Vedic texts name different gods and goddesses as secondary creators (often Brahma in post-Vedic texts), and in some cases a different god or goddess is the secondary creator at the start of each cosmic cycle (''kalpa'', aeon).&lt;ref name="Stella Kramrisch 1994 pages 205-206"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tpinchman125/&gt;

[[File:Sculpture of Brahma, Tamil Nadu.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture of Brahma flanked by [[Yama]] and [[Chitragupta]], [[Tamil Nadu]], 10th Century]]
In the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', Brahma is portrayed several times as the one who rises from the "Ocean of Causes".&lt;ref name=richard&gt;Richard Anderson (1967), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1769398  Hindu Myths in Mallarmé: Un Coup de Dés], Comparative Literature, Vol. 19, No. 1, pages 28-35&lt;/ref&gt; Brahma, states this Purana, emerges at the moment when time and universe are born, inside a lotus rooted in the navel of ''Hari'' (deity Vishnu, whose praise is the primary focus in the Purana). The scriptures assert that Brahma is drowsy, errs and is temporarily incompetent as he puts together the universe.&lt;ref name=richard/&gt; He then becomes aware of his confusion and drowsiness, meditates as an ascetic, then realizes ''Hari'' in his heart, sees the beginning and end of the universe, and then his creative powers are revived. Brahma, states Bhagavata Purana, thereafter combines ''[[Prakriti]]'' (nature, matter) and ''[[Purusha]]'' (spirit, soul) to create a dazzling variety of living creatures, and a tempest of causal nexus.&lt;ref name=richard/&gt; The Bhagavata Purana thus attributes the creation of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] to Brahma,{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} wherein he creates for the sake of creation, imbuing everything with both the good and the evil, the material and the spiritual, a beginning and an end.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Anderson (1967), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1769398  Hindu Myths in Mallarmé: Un Coup de Dés], Comparative Literature, Vol. 19, No. 1, page 31-33&lt;/ref&gt;

The Puranas describe Brahma as the deity creating time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} They correlate human time to Brahma's time, such as a [[Kalpa (aeon)|mahākalpa]] being a large cosmic period, correlating to one day and one night in Brahma's existence.&lt;ref name="Continuum"/&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

The stories about Brahma in various Puranas are diverse and inconsistent. In [[Skanda Purana]], for example, goddess Parvati is called the "mother of the universe", and she is credited with creating Brahma, gods, and the three worlds. She is the one, states Skanda Purana, who combined the three ''Gunas'' - Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas - into matter (''Prakrti'') to create the empirically observed world.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Gier (1998), The Yogi and the Goddess, International Journal of Hindu Studies, Vol. 1, No. 2, pages 279-280&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vedic discussion of Brahma as a ''Rajas''-quality god expands in the Puranic and [[Tantra|Tantric]] literature. However, these texts state that his wife [[Saraswati]] has ''[[Sattva]]'' (quality of balance, harmony, goodness, purity, holistic, constructive, creative, positive, peaceful, virtuous), thus complementing Brahma's ''Rajas'' (quality of passion, activity, neither good nor bad and sometimes either, action qua action, individualizing, driven, dynamic).&lt;ref&gt;H Woodward (1989), The Lakṣmaṇa Temple, Khajuraho and Its Meanings, Ars Orientalis, Vol. 19, pages 30-34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alban Widgery (1930), The principles of Hindu Ethics, International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 40, No. 2, pages 234-237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Alter]] (2004), Yoga in modern India, Princeton University Press, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 51 of ''[[Manasara|Manasara-Silpasastra]]'', an ancient design manual in Sanskrit for making [[Murti]] and temples, states that a Brahma statue should be golden in color.&lt;ref name=pkacharya50&gt;PK Acharya, A summary of the Mānsāra, a treatise on architecture and cognate subjects, PhD Thesis awarded by Rijksuniversiteit te Leiden, published by BRILL, {{oclc|898773783}}, page 50&lt;/ref&gt; The text recommends that the statue have four faces and four arms, have ''jata-mukuta-mandita'' (matted hair of an ascetic), and wear a [[diadem]] (crown).&lt;ref name=pkacharya50/&gt; Two of his hands should be in refuge granting and gift giving [[mudra]], while he should be shown with ''kundika'' (water pot), ''akshamala'' (rosary), and a small and a large ''sruk-sruva'' (laddles used in yajna ceremonies).&lt;ref name=pkacharya50/&gt; The text details the different proportions of the ''murti'', describes the ornaments, and suggests that the idol wear ''chira'' (bark strip) as lower garment, and either be alone or be accompanied with goddess [[Saraswati]]. Brahma is associated largely with the Vedic culture of [[yajna]] and knowledge. In some Vedic [[yajna]], Brahma is summoned in the ritual to reside and supervise the ritual in the form of [[Prajapati]].

Brahma's wife is the goddess Saraswati.&lt;ref name=elizabeth204&gt;Elizabeth Dowling and W George Scarlett (2005), Encyclopedia of Religious and Spiritual Development, SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-0761928836}} page 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Kinsley (1988), Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520063392}}, pages 55-64&lt;/ref&gt; She is considered to be "the embodiment of his power, the instrument of creation and the energy that drives his actions".

In [[Prambanan]] there is a special temple made for Brahma, side by side with Vishnu, and in [[Bali]] there is Andakasa Temple dedicated to Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= https://baliexpress.jawapos.com/read/2017/08/24/9520/menyingkap-misteri-dewa-brahma-jarang-dipuja |title= Menyingkap Misteri Dewa Brahma Jarang Dipuja (Indonesian)|work=Baliexpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, although not as popular as Vishnu and Shiva, the name Brahma appeared on several occasions. In the legend that developed in [[East Java]] about Ken Arok, for example, Brahma is believed to be the biological father of [[Ken Arok]]. It is said that Brahma was fascinated by the beauty of Ken Arok's mother, Ken Endok and made her a lover. From this relationship was born Ken Arok. The name Brahma is also used as the name of a mountain in the Tengger Mountains range, namely [[Mount Bromo]]. Mount Bromo is believed to be derived from the word Brahma and there was once a sect that believed that Brahmaloka – the universe where Brahma resided – was connected to Mount Bromo.

In the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] version of [[wayang]](shadow puppet play), Brahma has a very different role from his initial role. When Hindu society began to disappear from [[Java]] and the era of [[Walisongo]]'s [[wayang kulit]] began to emerge, Brahma's role as creator in the shadow puppet standard was given to a figure named Sang Hyang Wenang, while Brahma himself was renamed to Brama (fire) where he was a ruling god. Brama, the son of the figure of [[Bathara Guru]] (Shiva). The figure of Brahma in Javanese wayang is fused and mixed with the figure of Agni.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= https://gamabali.com/dewa-brahma/|title=Dewa Brahma|work=GamaBali}}&lt;/ref&gt;
