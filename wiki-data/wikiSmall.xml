In [[Roman mythology]], '''Pilumnus''' ("staker") was a nature deity, brother of [[Picumnus (mythology)|Picumnus]].  He ensured children grew properly and stayed healthy.  Ancient Romans made an extra bed after the birth of a child in order to ensure the help of Pilumnus.  He also taught humanity how to grind [[Cereal|grain]].  He was also sometimes identified as the husband of [[Danaë]], and therefore the father of [[Danaus]] and the ancestor of [[Turnus]].

A ceremony to honour the deity involved driving a stake into the ground.

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''Dius Fidius''' (less often as '''Dius Fidus''') was a [[List of Roman deities|god]] of [[oath]]s associated with [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]]. His name was thought to be related to [[Fides (goddess)|Fides]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] s. v. medius&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fidius'' may be an earlier form for ''filius'', "son",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1258.html William Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, v. 2, page 150, under Fidius] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514064436/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1258.html |date=May 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the name Dius Fidius originally referring to [[Hercules]] as a son of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', 6. 213&lt;/ref&gt; According to some writers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], Letters to friends, 5. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]], Letters, 4. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase ''medius fidius'' was equivalent to ''mehercule'' "My Hercules!", a common [[interjection]].

==Theology==
Varro states that his teacher [[Aelius Stilo]] called this god ''Diovis filium'',  i.e. ''Dius Filius'' as the Greek ''Διόσκορον Castorem'' on the grounds of the alteration of the letters ''d'' and ''l'' in the [[Sabine]] tongue. He identified him in Sabine, [[Sancus]] and in Greek, Hercules.&lt;ref&gt;Varro LL V 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yves Lehmann "La dette de Varron  à l' égard de son mâitre Aelius Stilo" in '''MEFRA'''  '''97''' 1985  1 p. 519-520.&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption is not linguistically correct, because in the [[Iguvine Tables]] the god is named ''Fis(i)us'' or ''Fisovius Sancius''. However, his interpretation, based on unknown theological documents, tallies with that of some modern scholars.{{sfnp|Woodard|2005}}&lt;ref&gt;G. Freyburger  ''Fides'' Dissertation  Strassbourg 1983  p. 476 f.&lt;/ref&gt; The god, at some points, was certainly not a mere aspect of Jupiter but a separate entity, known in Rome for some time as Semo [[Sancus]] Dius Fidius. Wissowa argues that Jupiter and Dius Fidius divide responsibility for ensuring good faith. The most important oaths are sworn by Jupiter, the god of the ''Fides Publica Populi Romani'' as ''Iuppiter Lapis''. Dius Fidius protects good faith in private affairs: he corresponds to Ζευς Πίστιος.{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=103}} This view may well reflect a later development but is not the original interpretation.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Dius Fidius was not confined to private ''fides'' in early times. Matters of public relevance (such as the first international treaty of Rome, the one with [[Gabii]]) were preserved in his shrine (put under his jurisdiction).

The shrine of Sancus had no roof, as it was deemed inappropriate and ineffective to swear oaths unless under the sky. The Capitoline temple also had an opening in its roof.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

The association of Dius Fidius with Jupiter is divine filiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodard|2005|page=189}}. Woodard thinks  Dius Fidius is the Roman equivalent of Trita Apya,{{anchor|Trita_Apya}} the companion of Indra in the slaying of Vrtra.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil underlines the peculiar intertwining and mixing of Jupiter and Dius Fidius as wardens of oaths and wielders of lightning bolts. Both require an opening in the roof of their temples while leaving unanswered for Dumézil the question of the true identity of the latter.{{sfnp|Dumézil|1977|page=169}}

This functional overlap generated confusion about the identity of Sancus Dius Fidius among ancient and modern scholars, as Dius Fidius has sometimes been considered another [[theonym]] for Jupiter.{{sfnp|Dumézil|1977|page=189}} However, the autonomy of Semo Sancus from Jupiter and the fact that Dius Fidius is an alternate theonym designating Semo Sancus (and not Jupiter) is shown by the name of the correspondent Umbrian god Fisus Sancius which compounds the two constituent parts of Sancus and Dius Fidius: in Umbrian and Sabine ''Fisus'' is the exact correspondent of ''Fidius'',  as e.g. Sabine ''Clausus'' of Latin ''Claudius''.{{sfnp|Rosenzweig|1937}}&lt;ref&gt;D. Briquel "Les aspects militaires du dieu ombrien Fisus Sancius" in '''MEFRA''' 1979 p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Norden ''Aus Alrōmischer Priesterbüchen'' Lund 1939 p.  .&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that Sancus as Jupiter is in charge of the observance of oaths, of the laws of hospitality and of loyalty (''Fides'') connects him with the sphere and values of sovereignty, i.e. in Dumézil's terminology, of the first function.

Wissowa advanced the hypothesis that Semo Sancus is the [[genius (mythology)|genius]] of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wissowa in ''Roschers Lexicon'' 1909 s.v. Semo Sancus col. 3654&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|pages=131 f}} W. W. Fowler cautioned that this interpretation looks to be an anachronism and Sancus is a ''Genius Iovius'', as it appears from the Iguvine Tables.{{sfnp|Fowler|1899|page=139}} The concept of a ''genius'' of a deity is attested only in the imperial period.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

[[Theodor Mommsen]], [[William Warde Fowler]] and [[Georges Dumézil]] among others rejected the tradition that ascribes a Sabine origin to the Roman cult of Semo Sancus Dius Fidius, partly on linguistic grounds as the theonym is Latin and no mention or evidence of a Sabine ''Semo'' is found near Rome, while the ''Semones'' are attested in Latin in the [[carmen Arvale]]. In their view Sancus would be a deity who was shared by all ancient Italic peoples, whether Osco-Umbrian or Latino-Faliscan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dumézil|1977|page=80}} n. 25, citing also G. Wissowa in ''Roschers Lexicon'' s.v. Sancus, IV, 1909, col. 3168; Dumézil wholly rejects the tradition of the synecism of Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

The details of the cult of Fisus Sancius at Iguvium and those of Fides at Rome,&lt;ref&gt;cf.Livy I 21, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Servius ''Aen.'' I 292 on this prescription of Numa's.&lt;/ref&gt;  such as the use of the ''mandraculum'', a piece of linen fabric covering the right hand of the officiant, and of the ''urfeta'' (''orbita'') or of the  ''orbes  ahenei'', sort of small bronze disc brought in the right hand by the officiant at Iguvium and also deposed in the temple of Semo Sancus in 329 B.C. after an affair of treason&lt;ref&gt;Livy  VIII 20, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Fowler|1899|page=138}}{{sfnp|Rosenzweig|1937|page=210}}&lt;ref&gt;D. Briquel "Sur les aspects militaires du dieu ombrien Fisus Sancius" in '''MEFRA''' 1979 p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; confirm the parallelism.

Some aspects of Dius Fidius' oath ritual, such as requiring the open sky, the ''compluvium'' of private residences and the fact the temple of Sancus had no roof, implied to romanist O. Sacchi the idea that Dius Fidius' oath predated that for ''Iuppiter Lapis'' or ''Iuppiter Feretrius'', and had its origin in prehistoric rituals, when the ''templum'' was in the open air and defined by natural landmarks such as the highest nearby tree.&lt;ref&gt;O. Sacchi "Il trivaso del Quirinale" in ''Revue internationale de droit de l’Antiquité'' 2001 pp. 309-311, citing  Nonius Marcellus s.v. rituis (L p.494): ''Itaque domi rituis nostri, qui per dium Fidium iurare vult, prodire solet in compluvium.'', 'thus according to our rites he who wishes to swear an oath by Dius Fidius he as a rule walks to the ''compluvium'' (an unroofed space within the house)'.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 11, 5 on the use of the private ''mensa'' as an altar mentioned in the ''ius Papirianum''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granius Flaccus ''indigitamenta'' 8 (H. 109) on king Numa's vow by which he asked for the divine punishment of  perjury by all the gods.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting this interpretation is the explanation of the theonym Sancus as meaning ''sky'' in Sabine given by Johannes Lydus,&lt;ref&gt;Lydus ''de Mensibus'' IV 90&lt;/ref&gt; an etymology that, however, is rejected by Dumézil, Briquel and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=G. Capdeville |title= Les dieux de Martianus Capella |journal= Revue de l'histoire des religions |volume= 213 |date= 1996 |issue=3  |page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the known details concerning Sancus connect him to the sphere of oaths, respect of compacts and the divine guarantee against their breach. These values are all proper to sovereign gods and in common with Jupiter (and with [[Mitra]] in [[Vedic mythology|Vedic religion]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Spiniensis''' was the god of [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns]]. People prayed to him when they removed thorny plants from their fields as he presided over the digging out of thorn bushes and guarded the field against thorns. His name comes from ''spina'' ("spine").&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, J. (1988). "Divinities" (p. 835). In M. Grant &amp; R. Kitzinger (eds.), ''Civilization of the Ancient Mediterranean. Greece and Rome.

      <text bytes="6332" xml:space="preserve">'''Bonus Eventus''' ("Good Outcome") was a divine [[personification]] in [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]]. The [[Roman Republic#Late Republic (147 BC - 30 BC)|Late Republican]] scholar [[Varro]] lists him as one of the twelve deities who presided over [[Roman agriculture|agriculture]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''De re rustica'' 1.1.4–6; [[Clifford Ando]], ''The Palladium and the Pentateuch: Towards a Sacred Topography of the Later Roman Empire'', ''Phoenix'' 55 3.4 (2001), p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; paired with [[Lympha]], the goddess who influenced the water supply. The original function of Bonus Eventus may have been agricultural,&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; but during the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]], he represents a more general concept of success and was among the numerous abstractions who appeared as icons on [[Roman currency|Roman coins]].

==Cult and inscriptions==
{{ancient Roman religion}}
Bonus Eventus had a [[Roman temple|temple]] of unknown date in the [[Campus Martius]]. It is mentioned only by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], in connection to a new [[portico]] ''(Porticus Boni Eventūs)'' built by the [[Praefectus urbi|urban prefect]] Claudius in 374 AD. Five [[Corinthian capital]]s "of extraordinary size" that were uncovered in the 19th century may have belonged to the portico, which was located in the [[Gardens of Agrippa]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''New Topographical Dictionary'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[epithet]] ''Bonus'', "the Good," is used with other abstract deities such as ''Bona Fortuna'' ("Good Fortune"), ''Bona Mens'' ("Good Thinking" or "Sound Mind"), and ''[[Spes|Bona Spes]]'' ("Valid Hope," perhaps to be translated as "Optimism"), as well as with the mysterious and multivalent [[Bona Dea]], a goddess whose rites were celebrated by women.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik H.J. Brouwer, ''Bona Dea: The Sources and a Description of the Cult'' pp. 245–246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inscriptional evidence for the god is found at several locations, including in the [[Roman province|provinces]]. Senior officials at [[Sirmium]], [[Pannonia]], dedicated a shrine to Bonus Eventus for the wellbeing of high-ranking members of the city council.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Wilkes, "The Roman Danube: An Archaeological Survey," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 95 (2005), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Roman Britain]], the [[mosaic]] floor of a villa at [[Woodchester]] bore the reminder ''Worship Bonus Eventus duly.'' A [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#votum|dedication]] made by a married couple to Bonus Eventus along with [[Fortuna]] indicates that the god's sphere of influence had expanded beyond both agriculture and the embodiment of imperial virtues.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Rufus Fears]], "The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.17.2 (1981), p. 935; Martin Henig, "Roman Religion and Roman Culture in Britain," in ''A Companion to Roman Britain'' (Blackwell, 2004), p. 227. The mosaic inscription is ''RIB'' 2448.2. The couple were a Cornelius Castus and Julia Belismicus, at [[Caerleon]] (''RIB'' 318).&lt;/ref&gt; Images of Bonus Eventus appear regularly on [[engraved gem]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Henig, "Roman Religion and Roman Culture in Britain," p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a [[jeweller]]'s [[hoard]] from [[Snettisham]], Bonus Eventus was the most frequent device on [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglios]], appearing on 25 percent of the 127 found.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandra Croom]], "Personal Ornament," in ''A Companion to Roman Britain'', p. 296. Most of the intaglios depict the same four devices, with [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] (20 percent), [[Fortuna]] (13 percent) and a [[parrot]] (12 percent) the most popular after Bonus Eventus.&lt;/ref&gt; These usages point to a protective or [[tutelary deity|tutelary]] function for the god, as well as the existence of a religious community to which the jeweller marketed his wares.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, "Roman Religion and Roman Culture in Britain," pp. 227–228; Croom, "Personal Adornment," pp. 295–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
Coins featuring Bonus Eventus were issued during the turmoil of the [[Year of Four Emperors]] (69 AD) and the reigns of [[Galba]], [[Vespasian]], [[Titus]], [[Antoninus Pius]], and [[Septimius Severus]].&lt;ref&gt;Fears, "The Cult of Virtues," pp. 897, 900–901, 903–904.&lt;/ref&gt; On these coins and on gems, Bonus Eventus is a standing male nude, usually with one leg bent and his head turned away toward a [[patera|libation bowl]] in his outstretched hand. Sometimes he is partially clad in a [[chlamys]] that covers his back, or in an over-the-shoulder [[himation]] with the ends framing his torso. [[Poppy|Poppies]] and stalks of grain are common attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Olga Palagia, ''Euphranor'' (Brill, 1980), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In his book on sculpture, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] describes two statues of "Bonus Eventus" which were in fact renamed images of [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek gods]]. One was a bronze by [[Euphranor]] and the other a marble by [[Praxiteles]]. The latter stood in the [[Capitolium]] with a statue of Bona Fortuna, and the former somewhere between the repurposed [[Athena]] below the Capitol and the [[Leto]] in the [[Temple of Concord]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 36.23.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear from Pliny's description whether both Greek statues had originally represented the same Greek deity.&lt;ref&gt;Palagia, ''Euphranor'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[classics|classical]] [[art historian]] [[Adolf Furtwängler]] conjectured that Praxiteles had depicted an [[Agathos Daimon]], since he was accompanied by a "Bona Fortuna," presumably a translation of the Greek ''[[Tyche|Agathē Tychē]]''. Euphranor's bronze is sometimes taken as the type on which the iconography of coins and gems was based, since the figure held poppies and grain. These attributes suggest an [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Eleusinian]] deity, and while the Greek original is most often taken as [[Triptolemus]], no extant depictions of Triptolemus show the combination of poppies and grain, which is associated with [[Demeter]] (Roman [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]).&lt;ref&gt;Palagia, ''Euphranor'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deus Nemausus''' is often said to have been the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] patron [[god]] of Nemausus ([[Nîmes]]). The god does not seem to have been worshipped outside this locality. The city certainly derives its name from Nemausus, which was perhaps the sacred wood in which the [[Celts|Celtic]] tribe of the [[Volcae Arecomici]] (who of their own accord surrendered to the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] in 121 BC) held their assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle= Nîmes |volume= 19 | pages = 701&amp;ndash;702; see final para |quote= Nîmes, the ancient Nemausus, derived its name from the sacred wood in which the Volcae Arecomici (who of their own accord surrendered to the Romans in 121 B.C.) were wont to hold their assemblies.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or perhaps it was the local Celtic spirit guardian of the spring that originally provided all water for the settlement, as many modern sources suggest. Or perhaps [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] was correct in stating in his geographical dictionary that Nemausos, the city of Gaul, took its name from the [[Heracleidae|Heracleid]] (or son of [[Heracles]]) Nemausios.

An important healing-spring sanctuary existed in the town; it was established in some form at least as early as the early Iron Age but was expanded after the Romans colonised the region in the late 2nd century BC, when there was active Roman encouragement of the cult. Another set of local spirits worshiped at Nemausus (Nîmes) were the Nemausicae or [[Matres]] Nemausicae, who were fertility and healing goddesses belonging to the spring sanctuary.

{{About|the Roman god|the fictional god|Cthulhu Mythos deities}}
{{Ancient Roman religion}}

'''Summanus''' ({{lang-lat|Summānus}}) was the god of nocturnal [[thunder]] in [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], as counterposed to [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], the god of diurnal (daylight) thunder.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus ''Festi epitome'' 284L (=229M)&lt;/ref&gt; His precise nature was unclear even to [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;"The temple is said to have been dedicated to Summanus, whoever he may be" (''quisquis is est, Summano templa feruntur''): Ovid, ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'' 6, 731. Translation by [[James G. Frazer]], [[Loeb Classical Library]]. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] mentie temple at ''Natural History'' 29.57 (= 29.14).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] thought that he was of [[Etruscan religion|Etruscan origin]], and one of the [[Novensiles#Council on lightning|nine gods of thunder]].&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' 2.53 (alternative numbering 52 or 138): "The Tuscan books inform us, that there are nine Gods who discharge thunder-storms, that there are eleven different kinds of them, and that three of them are darted out by Jupiter. Of these the Romans retained only two, ascribing the diurnal kind to Jupiter, and the nocturnal to Summanus; this latter kind being more rare, in consequence of the heavens being colder" ''(Tuscorum litterae novem deos emittere fulmina existimant, eaque esse undecim generum; Iovem enim trina iaculari. Romani duo tantum ex iis servavere, diurna attribuentes Iovi, nocturna Summano, rariora sane eadem de causa frigidioris caeli)''. English translation by [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]], via [[Perseus Digital Library]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varro]], however, lists Summanus among [[List of Roman deities#Sabine gods|gods he considers of Sabine origin]], to whom king [[Titus Tatius]] dedicated altars ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ara|arae]])'' in consequence of a [[votum]].&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''Lingua Latina'' V 74.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paulus Diaconus]] considers him a god of lightning.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on ''Dium'' above.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Summanus'' is thought to be from ''Summus Manium'' "the greatest of the [[Manes]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Summanus |volume=26 |pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''sub-'', "under" + ''manus'', "hand".

According to [[Martianus Capella]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Martianus Capella]], ''De nuptiis'' 2.164.&lt;/ref&gt; Summanus is another name for [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] as the "highest" ''(summus)'' of the [[Manes]]. This identification is taken up by later writers such as [[Camões]] ("If in Summanus' gloomy realm / Severest punishment you now endure ...")&lt;ref&gt;[[Os Lusíadas]], IV, 33, translated as ''The Lusiad'' by Thomas Moore Musgrave (1826).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Milton|Milton]], in a [[simile]] to describe [[Satan]] visiting [[Rome]]: "Just so Summanus, wrapped in a smoking whirlwind of blue flame, falls upon people and cities".&lt;ref&gt;In the Latin poem "In Quintum Novembris" (lines 23–24): ''Talibus infestat populos Summanus et urbes / cinctus caeruleae fumanti turbine flammae.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Dumézil]]&lt;ref&gt;''Myth et epopée'' vol. III part 2 chapt. 3; ''Mitra-Varuna: essai sur deux representations indoeuropeennes de la souverainetè '' Paris 1948 2nd; ''La religion romaine archaïque'' Paris 1974; It. tr. Milano 1977 p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that Summanus would represent the uncanny, violent and awe-inspiring  element of the gods of the [[Trifunctional hypothesis|first function]], connected to heavenly sovereignty. The double aspect of heavenly sovereign power would be reflected in the dichotomy [[Varuna]]-[[Mitra]] in [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] and in Rome in the dichotomy Summanus-[[Dius Fidius]]. The first gods of these pairs would incarnate the violent, nocturnal, mysterious aspect of sovereignty while the second ones would reflect its reassuring, daylight and legalistic aspect.

==Temple and Cult==
The temple of Summanus was dedicated during the [[Pyrrhic War]] c. 278 BCE on June 20.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''fasti'' VI 729-731; Fasti Esquil.,  Venus., Amit.: ad XII Kal. Iul.; CIL I 2nd p. 211, 221,243, 320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''Nat. Hist.'' XXIX 14; Livy ''Periochae'' XIV. For dedication year, see 
Orlin, Eric M., "Foreign Cults in Republican Rome: Rethinking the Pomerial Rule", ''Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome'', Vol. 47 (2002), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; It stood at the west of the [[Circus Maximus]], perhaps on the slope of the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]]. It seems the temple had been dedicated because the statue of the god which stood on the roof of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus had been struck by a lightning bolt.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ball Platner, T. Ashby ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' Baltimore 1928 p. 408, citing Cicero ''de Div.'' I 10; Livy ''Periochae'' XIV; Iordanes I 2, 14-15; 98-100&lt;/ref&gt;
Every June 20, the day before the [[summer solstice]], round cakes called ''summanalia'', made of flour, milk, and honey and shaped as wheels,&lt;ref&gt;Festus p.557 L&lt;/ref&gt; were offered to him as a token of propitiation: the wheel might be a solar symbol. Summanus also received a sacrifice of two black oxen or wethers. Dark [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|animals]] were typically offered to [[chthonic]] deities.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Scheid]], "Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors", in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 264; Raffaele Pettazzoni, "The Wheel in the Ritual Symbolism of Some Indo-European Peoples," in ''Essays on the History of Religions'' (Brill, 1967), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] records that in earlier times Summanus had been more exalted than Jupiter, but with the construction of a temple that was more magnificent than that of Summanus, Jupiter became more honored.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''City of God'' IV 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicero recounts that the clay statue of the god which stood on the roof of the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] was struck by a lightning bolt: its head was nowhere to be seen. The [[haruspice]]s announced that it had been hurled into the [[Tiber River]], where indeed it was found on the very spot indicated by them.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Divinatione'' I 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple of Summanus itself was struck by lightning in 197 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Livy ''AUC'' XXXII 29, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summanus and Mount Summano==

Mount Summano (elevation 1291&amp;nbsp;m), located in the Alps near [[Vicenza]] (Veneto, Italy), is traditionally considered a site of the cults of Pluto, Jupiter Summanus, and the [[Manes]].

The area was one of the last strongholds of pagan religion in Italy, as shown by the fact that Vicenza had no bishop until 590&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref name=Puttin-1977/&gt;

Archeological excavations have found a sanctuary space that dates to the first Iron Age (9th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BCE) and was continuously active until late antiquity (at least the 4th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;CE). The local flora is very peculiar, because it was customary in ancient times for pilgrims to bring offerings of flowers from their own native lands.&lt;ref name=Puttin-1977/&gt;

The mountaintop is frequently struck by lightning. The mountain itself has a deep grotto named Bocca Lorenza, in which, according to local legend, a young shepherdess became lost and disappeared. The story might be an adaptation of the myth of Proserpina, who was abducted by Pluto.&lt;ref name=Puttin-1977&gt;{{cite book |first=Lucio |last=Puttin |title=Monte Summano: Storia, arte, e tradizioni |publisher=Schio |year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Although he was originally an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] god, his worship spread to Rome, and appears to have replaced or coincided with the Roman god Tiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oswalt|first1=Sabine G|last2=Cottrell|first2=Leonard|title=Concise encyclopedia of Greek and Roman mythology|date=1969|publisher=Collins|location=Glasgow|isbn=978-0695861094|page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

==History==
Although originally popular enough to receive his own ''Flamen'', he vanished into obscurity around the time of the late Roman Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adkins|first1=Lesley|last2=Adkins|first2=Roy A.|title=Handbook to life in ancient Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/handbooktolifean00libg|url-access=limited|date=2004|publisher=Facts On File|location=New York|isbn=9780816074822|page=[https://archive.org/details/handbooktolifean00libg/page/n320 306]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Volturnus was a man, who had long blonde hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Brian|title=Rivers and the Power of Ancient Rome|date=2012|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9780807869048|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Volturnus had at least two descendants, a daughter named [[Juturna]], a grandchild named [[Fontus|Fons]]. Fons was born of a love affair between Juturna and [[Janus]], and was the god of spring water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiseman|first1=T.P.|title=The myths of Rome|date=2004|publisher=University of Exeter, UK|location=Great Britain|isbn=9780859897037|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:0 Vertumne et Pomone - Peter Paul Rubens (1617-1619).JPG|thumb|279px|''Vertumnus and Pomona'' (c. 1618) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Vertumnus'''  ({{IPA-la|wɛr'tʊmnʊs}}; also '''Vortumnus''' or '''Vertimnus''') is the god of seasons, change&lt;ref&gt;" Vertumnus then, that turn'st the year about," ([[Thomas Nashe]], ''Summer's Last Will and Testament'' (1592, printed 1600)).&lt;/ref&gt; and plant growth, as well as gardens and fruit trees.  He could change his form at will; using this power, according to [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (xiv), he tricked [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]] into talking to him by disguising himself as an old woman and gaining entry to her [[orchard]], then using a narrative warning of the dangers of rejecting a suitor (the embedded tale of [[Iphis]] and [[Anaxarete]]) to seduce her. The tale of Vertumnus and Pomona has been called "the first exclusively Latin tale."&lt;ref&gt;It is called the first exclusively Latin tale by Charles Fantazzi, "The revindication of Roman myth in the Pomona-Vertumnus tale",  in N. Barbu ''et al.'', eds. ''Ovidianum'' (Bucharest, 1976:288), as Roxanne Gentilcore notes in [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1192628 "The Landscape of desire: the tale of Pomona and Vertumnus in Ovid's 'Metamorphoses'"], ''Phoenix'' '''49'''.2 (Summer 1995:110-120), p. 110 ("It has also been called the first exclusively Latin tale") and note 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertumnus' [[Roman festivals|festival]] was called the '''Vertumnalia''' and was held 13 August.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult and origin==

The name ''Vortumnus'' most likely derives from Etruscan ''[[Voltumna]]''. Its formation in Latin was probably influenced by the Latin verb ''vertere'' meaning "to change", hence the alternative form ''Vertumnus''. Ancient etymologies were based on often superficial similarities of sound rather than the principles of modern scientific linguistics, but reflect ancient interpretations of a deity's function.&lt;ref&gt;Eytmology in Propertius, ''Elegy'' 4; commentary by L. Richardson Jr. (1977), noting that the etymology is not [[classical philology|philologically]] sound.&lt;/ref&gt; In writing about the [[Vestalia|Festival of Vesta]] in his poem on the [[Roman calendar]], Ovid recalls a time when the forum was still a reedy swamp and "that god, Vertumnus, whose name fits many forms, / Wasn’t yet so-called from damming back the river" (''averso amne'').&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'', Book 6, June 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] was convinced that Vortumnus was Etruscan, and a major god.&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De lingua latina'' V.46: ''"Ab eis [the Etruscans] dictus Vicus Tuscus, et ideo ibi Vortumnum stare, quod is deus Etruriae princeps"''&lt;/ref&gt; Vertumnus' cult arrived in [[Rome, Italy|Rome]] around 300 BC, and a temple to him was constructed on the [[Aventine Hill]] by 264 BC, the date when Volsinii (Etruscan Velzna) fell to the Romans. [[Sextus Propertius|Propertius]], the major literary source for the god, also asserts that the god was Etruscan, and came from [[Volsinii]].

Propertius refers to a bronze statue of Vortumnus&lt;ref&gt;Propertius, ''Elegy'' 4.2.41-46&lt;/ref&gt; made by the legendary [[Mamurius Veturius]], who was also credited with the twelve ritual shields ''([[ancile|ancilia]])'' of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]' priests the [[Salii]]. The bronze statue replaced an ancient [[maple]] statue ''([[xoanon]])'' supposed to have been brought to Rome in the time of [[Romulus]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Harmon, "Religion in the Latin Elegists", ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' 2.16.3 (1986), pp. 1960–61; W.A. Camps, ''Propertius: Elegies Book IV'' (Cambridge University Press, 1968), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue of Vortumnus ''(signum Vortumni)'' stood in a simple shrine located at the [[Vicus Tuscus]] near the [[Forum Romanum]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. J. Putnam, "The Shrine of Vortumnus" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' vol&amp;nbsp;'''71''', &amp;nbsp;2, pp&amp;nbsp;177-179 (April 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; and was decorated according to the changing seasons. In his poem about the god, Propertius has the statue of Vortumnus speak in first-person as if to a passer-by.&lt;ref&gt;E. C. Marquis (1974) "Vertumnus in Propertius 4, 2". ''Hermes'', vol&amp;nbsp;'''102''', no&amp;nbsp;3, pp&amp;nbsp;491-500.&lt;/ref&gt;

The base of the statue was discovered in 1549, perhaps still ''in situ'', but has since been lost. An inscription&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' VI.1.804: VORTUMNUS TEMPORIBUS DIOCLETIANI ET MAXIMIANI&lt;/ref&gt; commemorated  a restoration to the statue under [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] in the early 4th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;[[AD]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Lanciani (1903) ''Storia degli scavi di Roma'' vol. II, p. 204f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-classical tradition==

The subject of ''Vertumnus and Pomona'' appealed to European sculptors and painters of the 16th through the 18th centuries, providing a disguised erotic subtext in a scenario that contrasted youthful female beauty with an aged [[crone]]. In narrating the tale in the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', Ovid had observed that the kind of kisses given by Vertumnus were never given by an old woman:&lt;ref&gt;''Qualia numquam vera dedisset anus'' — [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; "so [[Circe]]'s smile conceals a wicked intention, and Vertumnus' hot kisses ill suit an old woman's disguise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donald |last=Lateiner |date=February–March 1996 |title=Nonverbal behaviors in Ovid's poetry, primarily ''Metamorphoses''&amp;nbsp;14 |journal=The Classical Journal |volume=91 |number=3 |pages=225–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject was even woven into [[tapestry]] in series with the generic theme ''Loves of the Gods'', of which the mid-16th-century [[Brussels tapestry]] at [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]], Lisbon, woven to cartoons attributed to [[Jan Vermeyen]], must be among the earliest. [[François Boucher]] provided designs for the tapestry-weaver Maurice Jacques at the [[Gobelins manufactory|Gobelins tapestry manufactory]] for a series that included ''Vertumnus and Pomona'' (1775–1778). A similar theme of erotic disguise is found with ''Jupiter wooing [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]] in the guise of Diana'', an example of which is at the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]].

[[Mme de Pompadour]], who sang well and danced gracefully, played the role of ''Pomone'' in a [[pastoral]] presented to a small audience at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pourquoi ''Le Devin du Village'' est un pastorale? |url-status=dead |url=http://www.threeweb.ad.jp/~nityshr/fronbun/dvpastoral.htm |postscript=;}} &lt;br/&gt;''See also'' article [[Le Devin du Village]].&lt;/ref&gt; the sculpture by [[Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne]] (1760) alludes to the event. 
&lt;!--the Pompadour Pomone reference should be checked against Philippe Beaussant, ''Les plaisirs de Versailles, théâtre et musique'' Chapter III, "Le théâtre de la Pompadour" Fayard, 1996.--&gt;

[[Camille Claudel]] sculpted a sensual marble version of "Vertumnus and Pomona" in 1905 (Musée Rodin, Paris).

[[Joseph Brodsky]] wrote a poem about Vertumnus.

==Modern interpretations==
David Littlefield finds in the episode a movement from [[rape]] to mutual desire, effected against an orderly, "civilised" [[Latium|Latian]] landscape.&lt;ref&gt;David Littlefield (1965) "Pomona and Vertumnus: a fruition of history in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''" ''Arion'' vol&amp;nbsp;'''4''', p&amp;nbsp;470.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Roxanne Gentilcore reads in its diction and narrative strategies images of deception, veiled threat and seduction, in which Pomona, the tamed [[hamadryad]] now embodying the orchard, does not have a voice.&lt;ref&gt;Roxanne Gentilcore (1995) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1192628 "The Landscape of Desire: The Tale of Pomona and Vertumnus in Ovid's 'Metamorphoses'"], ''Phoenix'' '''49'''.2 (Summer 1995:110-120).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Falacer,''' or more fully ''dīvus pater falacer'', was an ancient Italic god, according to [[Varro]].&lt;ref&gt;de L. L. v. 84, vii. 45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hartung]]&lt;ref&gt;''Die Religion der Römer'' ii. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; is inclined to consider him an [[epithet]] of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], since ''falandum'', according to [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], was the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] name for "heaven."

Although his origin is obscure, he was at one time considered important enough to have his own [[flamen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forsythe |first1=Gary |title=A Critical History of Early Rome |date=2005 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-22651-8 |page=137 |url=https://the-eye.eu/public/WorldTracker.org/World%20History/Roman%20Empire/critical%20history%20early%20rome.pdf |accessdate=Feb 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His name may appear in the name of the city of [[Falacrine]] ({{lang-la|Falacrīnum}} or {{lang|la|Phalacrīna}}). The name also has a correlation with [[Falerii]] and the [[Falisci]], and so it has been suggested that Falacer may have been the eponymous ancestor of these ancient tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Falacer |url=http://www.novaroma.org/nr/Falacer |website=novaroma.org |accessdate=Feb 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Honos''' ({{IPA-la|ˈhɔnoːs̠|lang}}) or '''Honor''' ({{IPA-la|ˈhɔnɔr|lang}}) was the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[God (male deity)|god]] personifying [[honor]].  He was closely associated with [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]], the [[goddess]] of [[Virtus|manliness]], or bravery, and the two are frequently depicted together.  Honos is typically shown wearing a [[laurel wreath|chaplet of bay leaves]], while Virtus is identified by her helmet.&lt;ref name="Harper's"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924027019482#page/n861/mode/2up "Honor or Honos"], in ''Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'', pp. 841, 842.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 234 BC, [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]] dedicated [[Temple of Honor and Virtue|a temple to Honos]] just outside the [[Porta Capena]], one of [[Ancient Rome|Rome's]] principal gates, following his victory over the [[Ligures]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', ii. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Platner Ashby HV"&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Honos_et_Virtus.html Samuel Ball Platner &amp; Thomas Ashby, "Honos et Virtus, Aedes"], in ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Twelve years later, after [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] defeated and slew the [[Insubres|Gallic]] king, [[Viridomarus]], at the [[Battle of Clastidium]], to win the ''[[spolia opima]]'', he vowed a temple to Honos and Virtus.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''History of Rome'', xxvii. 25, xxix. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  He renewed this vow after [[Siege of Syracuse (213–212 BC)|capturing Syracuse]] in 212 BC, during the [[Second Punic War]], and while [[Roman consul|consul]] in 208 he attempted to fulfill it by rededicating the existing temple in the name of both gods.  The [[College of Pontiffs]] refused to allow this, so Marcellus restored the temple of Honos, and built a second, adjoining shrine to Virtus, making a double temple.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''History of Rome'', xxvii. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plutarch Marcellus 28"&gt;Plutarch, "The Life of Marcellus", 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Symmachus, ''Epistulae'', i. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Marcellus was slain in an ambush near [[Venosa|Venusia]] later that year, so the temple was dedicated by [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (consul 196 BC)|his son]] in 205.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''History of Rome'', xxv. 40, xxvii. 27, xxix. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was richly adorned with treasures that Marcellus had brought from Syracuse, although many of these disappeared over the next two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''History of Rome'', xxv. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Republica'', i. 21, ''In Verrem'', iv. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximus, i. 1. § 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plutarch Marcellus 28"/&gt;  The temple was restored by [[Vespasian]], and was still standing in the fourth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Historia Naturalis'', xxxv. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Platner Ashby HV"/&gt;

Another temple to Honos and Virtus was built by [[Gaius Marius]] during his fifth consulship in 101 BC, using the spoils he had captured from the [[Cimbri]] and the [[Teutons|Teutones]].&lt;ref name="Platner Ashby HV"/&gt;  The shrine was probably built on the slopes of the [[Capitoline Hill]], and [[Vitruvius]] praises the work of its architect, Gaius Mucius.&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius, ''De Architectura'', vii. ''praef.'' 17, iii. 2. § 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was here that the [[Roman Senate]] voted to recall [[Cicero]] from exile in 57 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Pro Sestio'', 116, ''Pro Plancio'', 78, ''De Divinatione'', i. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Platner Ashby HV"/&gt;

'''Fontus''' or '''Fons''' (plural ''Fontes'', "Font" or "Source") was a god of wells and springs in [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]]. A [[Roman festivals|religious festival]] called the '''Fontinalia''' was held on October 13 in his honor. Throughout the city, fountains and [[Puteal|wellheads]] were adorned with garlands.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Dyson, ''Rome: A Living Portrait of an Ancient City'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010), p. 228. Described by Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 6.3: "The Fontanalia [is named after] Fontus, because it's his holiday ''(dies [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|feriae]])''; on account of him then they toss wreaths into fountains and garland [[puteal]]s" (''Fontanalia a Fonte, quod is dies feriae eius; ab eo tum et in fontes coronas iaciunt et puteos coronant''). [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] also mentions the rites ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacra|sacra]])''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fontus was the son of [[Juturna]] and [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnobius]], ''Adversus Nationes'' 3.29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Numa Pompilius]], second [[king of Rome]], was supposed to have been buried near the altar of Fontus ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ara|ara]] Fontis)'' on the [[Janiculum]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''De legibus'' 2.56 and ''De natura deorum'' 3.52; [[Samuel Ball Platner]], ''The Topography and Monuments of Ancient Rome'' (1904), p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Warde Fowler]] observed that between 259 and 241 BC, cults were founded for Juturna, Fons, and the [[Tempestas|Tempestates]], all having to do with sources of water.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' (London, 1922), p. 285, with a speculation that this was a response to the [[Roman navy|naval activity]] of the [[First Punic War]].&lt;/ref&gt; As a god of pure water, Fons can be placed in opposition to [[Liber]] as a god of wine identified with [[Bacchus]].&lt;ref&gt;As when two characters argue over which holds ''[[imperium]]'' in [[Plautus]]'s ''Stichus'', line 696ff.; Thomas Habinek, ''The World of Roman Song'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

An inscription includes Fons among a series of deities who received expiatory sacrifices by the [[Arval Brothers]] in 224 AD, when several trees in the [[sacred grove]] of [[Dea Dia]], their chief deity, had been struck by lightning and burnt. Fons received two [[wikt:wether|wethers]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Fons was not among the deities depicted on coinage of the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Crawford (historian)|Michael H.

[[File:Euander-Pallene.jpg|thumb|200px|Evander from "[[Guillaume Rouillé|Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum]]"]]

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Evander''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] '''''Εὔανδρος''''' Euandros, "good man" or "strong man": an etymology used by poets to emphasize the hero's virtue)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2316312 Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary''] at the [[Perseus Digital Library]] via the [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/ Perseus Hopper], version 4.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[culture hero]] from [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], who was said to have brought the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek pantheon]], [[Ancient Greek law|laws]], and [[Greek alphabet|alphabet]] to [[Ancient Italy|Italy]], where he founded the city of [[Pallantium]] on the future site of [[Palatine Hill]], [[Rome]], sixty years before the [[Trojan War]]. He instituted the festival of the [[Lupercalia]]. Evander was deified after his death and an altar was constructed to him on the [[Aventine Hill]].

In addition, [[Strabo]] mentions a story that Rome was an [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadian]] colony founded by Evander.&lt;ref name ="Strabo"&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:5.3.3 Strabo, Geography, 5.3.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genealogy==
[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] writes that Evander was the son of [[Apollo]] and a local nymph of the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadians]], called Themis. He also mentions that the writers of the early history of Rome called her, in their native language, [[Carmenta]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0081.tlg001.perseus-grc1:1.31.1 Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, 2.1]&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo writes that the Romans honour the mother of Evander, regarding her as one of the nymphs, and have renamed her Carmenta (a derivation of the [[Latin]] word for song).&lt;ref name ="Strabo"/&gt;
Evander's wisdom was beyond that of all [[Regions of ancient Greece#Arcadia|Arcadian]]s. His son [[Pallas (son of Evander)|Pallas]] apparently died childless; however, the ''[[gens]]'' [[Fabia gens|Fabia]] claimed descent from Evander through his grandson [[Fabius]], son of [[Hercules]] by a daughter of Evander.&lt;ref&gt;Silius Italicus, "Quintus Fabius Maximus", 6. 634.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dionysius of Halicarnassus also mentions that some writers, including [[Polybius of Megalopolis]] say that Lavinia was the daughter of Evander and had a son with [[Heracles]] who was named Pallas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0081.tlg001.perseus-grc1:1.32.1  Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, 1.32.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the ''Aeneid''==
Evander plays a major role in Virgil's ''Aeneid'' Books VIII-XII. Previous to the [[Trojan War]], Evander gathered a group of native Latins to a city he founded in Italy near the [[Tiber]] river, which he named Pallantium.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aeneid]]'', viii&lt;/ref&gt; Virgil states that he named the city in honour of his Arcadian ancestor, Pallas, although [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [[Livy]]&lt;ref&gt;''Ab Urbe Condita'', 1.5.1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Antiquities'', i. 31&lt;/ref&gt; say that originally Evander's birth city was Pallantium in Arcadia, after which he named the new city. The reasons for Evander's fleeing his homeland are unclear; Ovid states that Evander had angered the Gods and had been sent into exile by way of a trial; Dionysius describes a civil unrest in Arcadia which led to Evander and his people being forced to leave; the commentator Servius, however, recounts that Evander's mother persuaded him to murder his father, [[Hermes]], leading to the pair being banished from Arcadia, although other commentators have it that Evander killed his mother. Evander settled in [[Pallantium]] where it is said he killed the three-souled Erulus, the king of Italy, three times in one day, prior to becoming the most powerful King of Italy. 

The oldest tradition of its founding ascribes to Evander the erection of the [[Great Altar of Hercules]] in the [[Forum Boarium]]. In ''[[Aeneid]]'', VIII, where [[Aeneas]] and his crew first come upon Evander and his people, they were venerating [[Hercules]] for dispatching the giant [[Cacus]]. Virgil's listeners would have related this scene to the same Great Altar of Hercules in the Forum Boarium of their own day, one detail among many in the Aeneid that Virgil used to link the heroic past of myth with the [[Caesar Augustus|Age of Augustus]]. Also according to Virgil, Hercules was returning from [[Cádiz|Gades]] with [[Geryon]]'s cattle when Evander entertained him. Evander then became the first to raise an altar to Hercules' heroism. This archaic altar was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of Rome]], AD 64.

Because of their traditional ties, Evander aids [[Aeneas]] in his war against [[Turnus]] and the [[Rutuli]]: the Arcadian had known the father of Aeneas, [[Anchises]], before the Trojan War, and shares a common ancestry through [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] with Aeneas's family.  In the Aeneid, it is said that Evander took possession of the country Italy by force, murdering king Herilus, the king of Praeneste.

{{short description|Ancient Roman god of keys and ports}}
{{Ancient Roman religion}}

'''Portunus''' was the [[ancient Roman religion | ancient Roman god]] of keys, doors, livestock and ports. He may have originally protected the warehouses where grain was stored, but later became associated with ports, perhaps because of folk associations between ''porta'' "gate, door" and ''portus'' "harbor", the "gateway" to the sea, or because of an expansion in the meaning of ''portus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fowler|first1=W. Warde|title=Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic|date=1899|publisher=Kennikat Press|location=Port Washington, NY|pages=202–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portunus later became conflated with the Greek [[Melicertes|Palaemon]].&lt;ref&gt;"Portunus gives to the sailor perfect safety in traversing the seas; but why has the raging sea cast up so many cruelly-shattered wrecks?" the Christian apologist [[Arnobius]] asks, c. 300 CE (''Seven Books against the Heathen'' III.23 ([http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1008/__P3.HTM on-line text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035454/http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1008/__P3.HTM |date=2007-09-30 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Portunus' festival, celebrated on August 17, the sixteenth day before the [[Kalends]] of September, was the '''Portunalia''', a minor occasion in the Roman year. On this day, keys were thrown into a fire for good luck in a very solemn and lugubrious manner. His attribute was a key and his main temple in the city of [[Rome]], the [[Temple of Portunus]], was to be found in the [[Forum Boarium]].

[[File:Piazza del Bocca della Verità - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Temple of Portunus]] in the [[Forum Boarium]]]]
Portunus appears to be closely related to the god [[Janus]], with whom he shares many characters, functions and the symbol of the key.&lt;ref&gt;Paul. p. 161 L2&lt;/ref&gt; He too was represented as a two headed being, with each head facing opposite directions, on coins and as figurehead of ships. He was considered to be ''deus portuum portarumque praeses''&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholium]] Veron. on ''Aeneid'' V.241&lt;/ref&gt; (lit. God presiding over ports and gates). The relationship between the two gods is underlined by the fact that the date chosen for the dedication of the rebuilt temple of Janus in the [[Forum Holitorium]] by emperor [[Tiberius]] is the day of the [[Portunalia]], August 17.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Dumézil ''La religion romaine archaïque'' Paris, 1974, part I,  chap.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguist Giuliano Bonfante has speculated, on the grounds of his cult and of the meaning of his name, that Portunus should be a very archaic deity and might date back to an era when Latins lived in dwellings built on pilings.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bonfante "Tracce di terminologia palafitticola nel vocabolario latino?" ''Atti dell'Istituto Veneto di scienze, lettere e arti'' '''97''' (1937:53-70).&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that in Latin the words  ''porta'' (door, gate) and ''portus'' (harbour, port) share their etymology from the same Indo-European root meaning ''ford'', ''wading point''.

Portunus' [[flamen]], the [[flamen Portunalis]], was one of the [[flamines minores]] and performed the ritual of oiling the spear (''hasta'') on the statue of god [[Quirinus]], with an ointment especially prepared for this purpose and stored in a small vase (''persillum'').&lt;ref&gt;Fest. p. 321 L2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orcus''' ({{lang-la|Orcus}}) was a god of the underworld, punisher of broken oaths in [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] and [[Roman mythology]]. As with [[Hades]], the name of the god was also used for the underworld itself. Eventually he was conflated with [[Dis Pater]] and [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]].

A temple to Orcus may once have existed on the [[Palatine Hill]] in [[Rome]]. It is likely that he was transliterated from the Greek [[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]] [[Horkos]], the personification of oaths and a son of [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]].{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Origins==
[[File:Odysseus and cyclops (orcus) Tomb of Orcus.jpg|thumb|Fresco of [[Odysseus]] (''{{lang-ett|Uθuste}}'') and the Cyclops (''{{lang-ett|Cuclu}}'') in the [[Tomb of Orcus]], [[Tarquinia]], [[Italy]].]]
The origins of Orcus may have lain in [[Etruscan religion]]. The so-called “[[Tomb of Orcus]]”, an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan site]] at [[Tarquinia]], is a misnomer, resulting from its first discoverers mistaking a hairy, bearded giant for Orcus; it actually depicts a [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]].

The Romans sometimes conflated Orcus with other gods such as [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], [[Hades]], and [[Dis Pater]], all gods of the underworld. The name “Orcus” seems to have been given to the malicious and punishing side of the ruler of the [[underworld]], as the god who tormented evildoers in their afterlife. Like the name Hades, “Orcus” could refer both to the underworld itself, as well as its ruling deity. In the charitable interpretation for such a place, it was believed to be an abode for purification of the souls of the deceased.&lt;ref name=Schuch-1842&gt;{{cite book |first=Christian Theophil |last=Schuch |title=Privatalterthümer, oder wissenschaftliches, religiöses und häuslisches Leben der Römer. Ein Lehr- und Handbuch für Studirende und Alterthumsfreunde |lang=de |trans-title=Private Antiquities: The scientific, religious, and domestic life of the Romans. A textbook and handbook for students and fans of antiquarian topics |place=Karlsruhe, DE |year=1842 |pages=360–361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orcus was chiefly worshipped in rural areas; he had no official cult in the cities.&lt;ref name=Bernheimer-1952-1979&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernheimer |first=Richard |orig-year=1952 |year=1979 |edition=reprint |title=Wild men in the Middle Ages |place=New York, NY |publisher=Octagon Books |ISBN=0-374-90616-5 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; This remoteness allowed for him to survive in the countryside long after the more prevalent gods had ceased to be worshipped. He survived as a folk figure into the [[Middle Ages]], and aspects of his worship were transmuted into the [[wild man]] festivals held in rural parts of Europe through modern times.&lt;ref name=Bernheimer-1952-1979/&gt; Indeed, much of what is known about the celebrations associated with Orcus come from medieval sources.&lt;ref name=Bernheimer-1952-1979/&gt;

==Persistence and later usage==
[[File:Master of the Aeneid Legend - The Descent of Aeneas into Hell - Walters 44205.jpg|right|thumb|''The Descent of Aeneas in the Underworld'' ({{circa|1530–1540}}), [[Walters Art Museum]] ]]
From Orcus' association with death and the underworld, his name came to be used for demons and other underworld monsters, particularly in Italian where ''orco'' refers to a kind of monster found in fairy-tales that feeds on human flesh.

The French word ''ogre'' (appearing first in [[Charles Perrault]]'s fairy-tales) may have come from variant forms of this word, ''orgo'' or ''ogro''; in any case, the French ''[[ogre]]'' and the Italian ''orco'' are exactly the same sort of creature.

===Ariosto===
An early example of an ''orco'' appears in [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' (1516), as a bestial, blind, tusk-faced monster inspired by the [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] of the ''[[Odyssey]]''.{{efn|The blind ''orco'' monster should not be confused with the other monster ''[[orca (sea monster)|orca]]'', a sea-monster which also appears in Ariosto and was later used as a genus-name for “[[killer whales]]” (''[[orca]]'').}}

===Tolkien===
The ''orco'' from ''[[Orlando Furioso|Orlando]]'', along with the [[Old English]] word ''orc'' (in the sense of an [[ogre]], like [[Grendel]]), was part of the inspiration for [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s ''[[orc]]s'' in his ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien |author-link=John Ronald Reuel Tolkien |year=1954–1955 |title=The Lord of the Rings |title-link=The Lord of the Rings}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other manuscripts Tolkien wrote a side-note on the word:
:The word used in translation of [[Quenya|Q{{grey|[uenya]}}]] ''urko'', [[Sindarin|S{{grey|[indarin]}}]] ''orch'', is orc. But that is because of the similarity of the ancient English word orc, 'evil spirit or bogey', to the Elvish words. There is possibly no connexion between them. The English word is now generally supposed to be derived from Latin Orcus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.R.R. |last=Tolkien |author-link=John Ronald Reuel Tolkien |editor=Tolkien, C. |editor-link=Christopher Tolkien |title=The War of the Jewels |title-link=The War of the Jewels |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2021}}

Also, in an unpublished letter sent to [[Gene Wolfe]], Tolkien also made this comment:
:Orc I derived from Anglo-Saxon, a word meaning demon, usually supposed to be derived from the Latin Orcus – Hell. But I doubt this, though the matter is too involved to set out here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Gene |last=Wolfe |date=December 2001 |title=The best introduction to the mountains |magazine=Interzone |via=Claranet Soho (clara.net) |url=http://home.clara.net/andywrobertson/wolfemountains.html |access-date=2014-02-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20040113063643/http%3A//home.clara.net/andywrobertson/wolfemountains.html |archive-date=2004-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this use, countless other [[fantasy]] games and works of fiction have borrowed the concept of the orc.

===Other modern-era use===
* The name "Orcus" appears in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' role-playing game as [[Orcus (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Orcus]], Prince of the Undead.

* Orcus appears as a character in [[Christopher Moore (author)|Christopher Moore]]'s novel ''[[A Dirty Job]]'' (2006).

* The [[Kuiper belt]] object [[90482 Orcus]] is named after Orcus. This was because Orcus was sometimes considered to be another name for [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], and also because [[Pluto]] and 90482 Orcus are both [[plutino]]s.

* In the TV series ''[[Happy! (TV series)|Happy!]]'' (2017-2019), Orcus possesses members of the Scaramucci crime family.

* Image of Orcus is used on the book cover The complete short stories of Ambrose Bierce. Compiled and Edited by Ernest Jerome Hopkins. 1970 Doubleday

* Orcus appears as a character in [[Qui Nguyen]]'s play ''[[She Kills Monsters]]'' (2011.

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Sors''', a lesser deity, was a god of luck. Supposedly a son of [[Fortuna]].

Scarcely mentioned in mythology, a handful of quotes cite him in such expressions "By the luck of Sors", or "Lived by a hairs breadth of Sors". 
Sors is also a popular name in [[poker]], as are both sayings. Sors is also a common term in [[gambling]]. Opera singer [[Joe Volpe]] composed a piece that mentioned Sors. “Legend says Sors still exists somewhere beyond. Acolytes say he is among gods. Non-believers say he never existed. But I say he is eternally found.”

      <text bytes="3144" xml:space="preserve">In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''Averruncus''' or '''Auruncus''' is a god of averting harm. [[Aulus Gellius]] says that he is one of the potentially malignant deities who must be propitiated for their power to both inflict and withhold disaster from people and the harvests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]], ''Attic Nights'' 5.12.14: ''In istis autem diis, quos placari oportet, uti mala a nobis vel a frugibus natis amoliantur, Auruncus quoque habetur''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[etymology]] of the name is often connected to the [[Latin]] verb ''avertere'', "to turn away,"&lt;ref&gt;As in the note to Aulus Gellius in the [[Loeb Classical Library]] [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/5*.html#note44 edition.]&lt;/ref&gt; a more probable origin lies in ''averro'' "to sweep away," hence ''averrunco'', "to ward off," perhaps with a reference to [[Broom#Brooms and witchcraft|magical sweeping]]. [[Varro]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 7.102.&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that the [[infinitive verb]] ''averruncare'' shares its etymology with the god whose primary function is averting. Averruncus may be among the ''[[indigitamenta]]'' pertaining to another god such as [[Apollo]] or [[Mars (god)|Mars]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 2001, originally published 1998), p. 41 [https://books.google.com/books?id=gZ4TKhaLwRsC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=averruncus+intitle:gods+inauthor:turcan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WMsITZXWH4KUnAedpOl7&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=averruncus%20intitle%3Agods%20inauthor%3Aturcan&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; that is, it may be a name to be used in a prayer formulary to fix the local action of the invoked deity.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Precise naming, in connection with concealing a deity's true name to monopolize his or her power, was a crucial part of prayer in antiquity, as evidenced not only in the traditional religions of Greece and Rome and [[syncretism|syncretistic]] [[Hellenistic religion]] and [[mystery cult]], but also in [[Judaism]] and [[ancient Egyptian religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Klinghardt, "Prayer Formularies for Public Recitation: Their Use and Function in Ancient Religion," Numen 46 (1999) 1–5; A.A.

'''Vejovis''' or '''Vejove''' ({{lang-lat|Vēiovis|italic=yes}}  or ''Vēdiovis''; rare ''Vēive''  or ''Vēdius'') was a [[Roman mythology|Roman god]] of [[Etruscan Civilization|Etruscan]] origins.

}}Vejovis was portrayed as a young man, holding a bunch of arrows, [[pilum]], (or lightning bolts) in his hand, and accompanied by a goat.  Romans believed that Vejovis was one of the first gods to be born. He was a god of healing, and became associated with the Greek [[Asclepius]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a5c1AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=vediovis&amp;q=vediovis&amp;pgis=1#search Roman Medicine By John Scarborough]&lt;/ref&gt; He was mostly worshipped in [[Rome]] and [[Bovillae]] in [[Latium]]. On the [[Capitoline Hill]] and on the [[Tiber Island]], temples were erected in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;The New Encyclopædia Britannica: in 30 volumes By Encyclopædia Britannica, Chicago University of, Encyclopædia Britannica Staff, Encyclopædia Britannica(ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=1BMrAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=vediovis&amp;q=vediovis&amp;pgis=1#search]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he was associated with volcanic eruptions, his original role and function is obscured to us.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1u4LAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=vediovis&amp;q=vediovis&amp;pgis=1#search Classical Quarterly By Classical Association (Great Britain)]&lt;/ref&gt; He is occasionally identified with [[Apollo]] and young [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-zlwiI7A734C&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=vediovis&amp;pg=PA106 The Cambridge History of Classical Literature By E. J. Kenney]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novaroma.org/calendar/januarius.html#Vediovis Nova Roma: Calendar of Holidays and Festivals]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aulus Gellius, in the ''[[Noctes Atticae]]'', written almost a millennium after; speculated that Vejovis was an ill-omened counterpart of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]]; compare [[Summanus]]. Aulus Gellius observes that the particle ''ve-'' that prefixes the name of the god also appears in [[Latin]] words such as ''vesanus'', "insane," and thus interprets the name Vejovis as the anti-[[Jove]].

===Temple===
He had a [[temple of Veiovis|temple]] between the two peaks of the [[Capitoline Hill]] in [[Rome]], where his statue carried a bundle of arrows and stood next to a statue of a she-goat.

===Sacrifices===
In spring, multiple goats were sacrificed to him to avert plagues.  [[Aulus Gellius|Gellius]] informs us that Vejovis received the [[sacrifice]] of a female [[goat]], sacrificed ''ritu humano'';&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]], ''Noctes Atticae'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/gellius/gellius5.shtml#12]&lt;/ref&gt; this obscure phrase could either mean "after the manner of a [[human sacrifice]]" or "in the manner of a burial."&lt;ref&gt;Adkins and Adkins, ''Dictionary of Roman Religion'' (Facts On File, 1996) {{ISBN|0-8160-3005-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These offerings were less about the animal sacrificed and more about the soul sacrificed.

==Festivals==
Vejovis had three festivals in the Roman Calendar: on 1 January, 7 March, and 21 May.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CPG_4CpoWfUC&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=vediovis&amp;pg=PA207 The Nature of the Gods By Marcus Tullius Cicero]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Endovelicus''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Endouellicus'', ''Endovélico''; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Endovélico'', ''Enobólico'') is the best known of the pre-Roman [[Lusitania]]n&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/21/92/_ebook.pdf |issn=1578-5386 |journal=Palaeohispánica: Revista Sobre Lenguas y Culturas de la Hispania Antigua |language=es |trans-title=Palaeohispánica: magazine on languages and cultures of ancient Hispania |via=ifc.dpz.es |publisher=Institución «Fernando el Católico» |volume=2 |date=2002 |title=Article title????}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]]  [[Deity|gods]] of the [[Iron Age]]. He was originally a [[chthonic]] god. He was the God/Lord of the Underworld and of health, prophecy and the earth, associated with vegetation and the afterlife. Later accepted by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] themselves, who assimilated it to [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] or to [[Serapis]] and made him a relatively popular god.&lt;ref&gt;Monteiro Teixeira, Sílvia. 2014. Cultos e cultuantes no Sul do território actualmente português em época romana (sécs.

Endovelicus has a temple in [[São Miguel da Mota]] in [[Alentejo]], Portugal, and there are numerous inscriptions and ''ex-votos'' dedicated to him in the [[Museu Nacional de Etnologia|Museu Etnológico de Lisboa]] (the Ethnological Museum of [[Lisbon]]); possible toponyms include [[Andévalo]] in [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Monteiro Teixeira, Sílvia. 2014. Cultos e cultuantes no Sul do território actualmente português em época romana (sécs. I a. C. – III d. C.). Masters’ dissertation on Archaeology.. Lisboa: Faculdade de Letras da Universidade de Lisboa.{{pn|date=October 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encarnação, José d’. 2015. Divindades indígenas sob o domínio romano em Portugal. Second edition. Coimbra: Universidade de Coimbra.{{pn|date=October 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cult of Endovelicus prevailed until the 5th century, just when Christianity was spreading in the region.

==Etymology==
In the last two centuries of scholarship, several etymologies have been proposed to Endovelicus's name.&lt;ref&gt;Monteiro Teixeira, Sílvia. 2014. Cultos e cultuantes no Sul do território actualmente português em época romana (sécs. I a. C. – III d. C.). Masters’ dissertation on Archaeology. Lisboa: Faculdade de Letras da Universidade de Lisboa.{{pn|date=October 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encarnação, José d’. 2015. Divindades indígenas sob o domínio romano em Portugal. Second edition. Coimbra: Universidade de Coimbra.{{pn|date=October 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, António da Visitação Freire classified it as a mixed [[Celt]]ic and [[Phoenicia]]n name, adapted to the [[Latin|Roman language]]. The ''End-'' radical would be from [[Celtic language]]s; ''[[Bel (god)|Bel]]'' (or ''Vel-'') would be Phoenician for 'Lord' and ''-Cus'' is a usual word termination in Latin. [[José Leite de Vasconcelos]] believed the word ''Endovellicus'' was an originally Celtic title ''Andevellicos'', meaning 'very good'.&lt;ref&gt;Vasconcellos, José Leite de. ''[https://archive.org/details/religiesdalusit01vascgoog/page/n157/mode/1up Religiões da Lusitania na parte que principalmente se refere a Portugal]''. Lisboa: Imprensa nacional, 1897. pp. 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate reading derives the word ''velicus'' from the Celtic ''vailos'' ("[[wolf]]"). Wolves were symbolic animals to the god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Álvarez Sanchís|first=Jesús|title=Los Vettones|url=|date=2003|publisher=[[Real Academia de la Historia]]|isbn=9788495983169|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recently proposed possibility suggests a loanword from [[proto-Basque]], from the ''*bels'' root. In this case the original name would have been ''*Endo-belles'', "most black", fitting his chthonic characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Encarnação, José d’. 2015. Divindades indígenas sob o domínio romano em Portugal. Second edition. Coimbra: Universidade de Coimbra.{{pn|date=October 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temples and cult==
There were several places where his cult could be observed:

In the municipality of [[Alandroal]], there is the ''Santuário da Rocha da Mina'' (Mina's Rock Sanctuary); some authors classify it as a temple of Endovelicus. It is the only known place of this kind in Southern Portugal. Near the [[temple]], we can find the Lucefecit [[rivulet]] that has been associated with [[Lucifer]] since the [[Middle Ages]]. Lucifer was the name used by the [[Roman mythology|Romans]] for the [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Morning star]] and the goddess [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]]. Some authors connect the name of the rivulet with the meaning of the place as being the "Glimpse of Light". A kilometer away, there is a sacred fountain that is said to be more ancient than the temple; its waters are still considered [[medicine|medicinal]].

The temple is rocky and hemmed in by a rocky formation that protects the site and the chiselled flooring is often related to Roman sacrificial altars. This sort of monument is not uncommon in the North of Portugal and on the Spanish Meseta.

Leite de Vasconcelos mentions that the site was used by the inhabitants of the Roman empire from all walks of life. Several inscriptions suggest that the temple of Endovelicus was used as an [[oracle]]. One of the inscriptions states: &lt;small&gt;EX IMPERATO AVERNO&lt;/small&gt;. Leite de Vasconcelos translated this as “''segundo a determinação que emanou de baixo''" (by the determination that emanated from below) suggesting that there is a similarity to the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] at [[Delphi]]. Steam would emanate from below, deep within the earth, and bestow clairvoyance. Vasconcelos also suggests that believers practiced the ''[[divination|incubatio]]'', sleeping at the site, hoping for [[dream]]s they could interpret later.

In [[Castro of Ulaca]] in [[Province of Ávila]], a city of the [[Vettones]], a sanctuary dedicated to ''Vaelicus'' has been discovered. The name could be related to Endovelicus.

The most notable sanctuary hypothetically dedicated to Endovelicus, is the [[Panoias Sanctuary|Roman Sanctuary of Panóias]] in [[Vila Real, Portugal|Vila Real]], [[Trás-os-Montes (region)|Trás-os-Montes]], with a complex system of "sinks" bearing Roman inscriptions. Nearby, in Cabeço de São Miguel da Mota, another temple dedicated to Endovelicus was built and, on its ruins, the [[Alans]] built or readapted the previous temple, a sanctuary dedicated to [[Saint Michael]] (''São Miguel'' in Portuguese). The Muslims transformed the temple into a [[mosque]], and with the [[Reconquista]] the temple was once again made a Christian temple. In 1559 the temple was still somewhat well preserved when the Cardinal Henrique ordered 96 marble columns to be removed from the place to build the ''Colégio do Espírito Santo'' in [[Évora]]. From the building only the staging remained. But archaeological forays have turned up [[pottery]] and [[amphora]]e as well as votive altars dedicated to Endovelicus, and lead to the discovery of several architectural elements, among them the "sinks" made in the rocks. The sinks suggests the existence of rituals, animal sacrifice and, possibly, feasts of a ritual nature.

The '''Palici''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Παλικοί}}, &lt;small&gt;[[Romanization of Greek|romanized]]:&lt;/small&gt; {{transliteration|grc|Palikoi}}), or '''Palaci''', were a pair of indigenous [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[chthonic]] deities in [[Roman mythology]], and to a lesser extent in [[Greek mythology]]. They are mentioned in [[Ovid]]'s ''Metamorphoses'' V, 406, and in [[Virgil]]'s ''Aeneid'' IX, 585. Their cult centered on three small lakes that emitted [[sulphur]]ous vapors in the [[Palagonia]] plain, and as a result these twin brothers were associated with [[geyser]]s and the underworld. There was also a shrine to the Palaci in Palacia, where people could subject themselves or others to tests of reliability through divine judgement; passing meant that an oath could be trusted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1515/9781400835850-004 |chapter=On Marvellous Thing Sheard |title=Complete Works of Aristotle, Volume 2 |year=1985 |last1=Dowdall |first1=L. D. |pages=1272–1298 |isbn=978-1-4008-3585-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genealogy==
The mythological lineage of the Palici is uncertain. One version of the legend attributes their parentage to sky god [[Zeus]] and nymph [[Aetna (nymph)|Aetna]]. Others associate their birth to a coupling between Aetna herself and smith deity [[Hephaestus]]. The "Greek version" indicate they are sons of Zeus and another nymph, called [[Thalia (nymph)|Thaleia]].&lt;ref&gt;Witczak K. T., Zawiasa D. (2004). "[https://antiquitasvivahome.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/54.1-2.05.-witczak-k.-t.-zawiasa-d.-palici-e28093-the-sicilian-twin-brothers-and-the-indo-european-myth-about-divine-twins.pdf Palici – the Sicilian Twin Brothers and the Indo- European Myth about Divine Twins]". In: ''Živa Antika'' [Antiquité Vivante]'' 54(1–2), 2004, pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt; A third account claimed that the Palici were the sons of the Sicilian deity [[Adranus]].

The medieval ''[[Vatican Mythographers]]'' book ascribed their lineage to Zeus and Aetna: Zeus (Jupiter) impregnated Aetna and she, fearing the wrath of Hera (Juno), was entrusted to Earth to protect her and her sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1515/9780823293315-004 |chapter=First mythographer |title=The Vatican Mythographers |year=2022 |pages=13–98 |isbn=978-0-8232-9331-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pepin2022&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1515/9780823293315-005 |chapter=Second mythographer |title=The Vatican Mythographers |year=2022 |pages=99–206 |isbn=978-0-8232-9331-5 |first1=Ronald E. |last1=Pepin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
The second book of the ''Vatican Mythographers'' translated their name as 'twice-born'.&lt;ref name=Pepin2022/&gt;

Scholar Marcel Meulder argues for a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] origin for their name, and relates it to a group of Greek compound names that belong to the semantic field of colours (e.g., ''leuko'' 'white'; ''melas'' 'black'). Thus, their name would mean 'of a white colour, of a grey colour, of a yellow colour' ("blanchâtre, jaunâtre, grisâtre”").&lt;ref name=Meulder1998&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meulder |first1=Marcel |title=Les dieux sicules paliques portent un nom indo-européen |journal=Latomus |date=1998 |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=33–37 |jstor=41538205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meulder |first1=Marcel |title=Le vers 4 du fragment 115 d'Empédocle (FVS 31 D.-K.): proposition d'une correction |trans-title=Verse 4 of fragment 115 of Empedocles (FVS 31 D.-K.): proposed correction |language=fr |journal=Elenchos |date=1 December 2016 |volume=37 |issue=1–2 |pages=33–68 |doi=10.1515/elen-2016-371-203 |s2cid=192732795 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggests it as evidence of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European character]] of the [[Siculian|Siculian language]].&lt;ref name=Meulder1998/&gt;

Polish historian Krzysztof Tomasz Witczak and Daria Zawiasa suggest the Palici may derive from the old [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Indo-European]] [[mytheme]] of the [[divine twins]].&lt;ref&gt;Witczak, K. T.; Zawiasa, D. "The Sicilian Palici as representatives of the indo-european divine twins". In: ''ΜΥΘΟΣ'', n. 12, 2004-2005. pp. 93-106.&lt;/ref&gt; they argue that the pair fit some of the common traits that scholar [[Donald J. Ward]] ascribed to the mytheme, such as a [[sky-god]]'s paternity and a single designation for both twins.&lt;ref&gt;Witczak K. T., Zawiasa D. (2004). "[https://antiquitasvivahome.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/54.1-2.05.-witczak-k.-t.-zawiasa-d.-palici-e28093-the-sicilian-twin-brothers-and-the-indo-european-myth-about-divine-twins.pdf Palici – the Sicilian Twin Brothers and the Indo- European Myth about Divine Twins]".

[[File:Luca Giordano - Picus and Circe.jpg|thumb|right|255px|&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt; Picus &lt;/div&gt;]]

'''Picus''' was a figure in [[Roman mythology]], the first king of [[Latium]]. He was the son of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], also known as Stercutus. He was the founder of the first Latin tribe and settlement, [[Laurentum]], located a few miles to the Southeast of the site of the later city of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Aug. C. D.: "exortum est regnum Laurentum ubi Saturni filius Picus regnum primus accepit". Servius Ad Aen. 7, 678: "...ut ecce Laurentum a Pico factum est, ut Laurentis regia Pici...".&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his skill at [[augur]]y and horsemanship.

== Mythology ==
According to [[Festus (historian)|Festus]] he got his name as a consequence of the fact that he used to rely on a [[woodpecker]] for the purpose of divination. Picus was also described to be quite handsome, sought after by [[nymph]]s and [[naiad]]s. The witch [[Circe]] attempted to seduce him with her charms and herbs while he was on a hunting trip, but he savagely rejected her. She turned him into a woodpecker for scorning her love. When his comrades accused Circe of her crime and demanded Picus' release, she turned them too into a variety of beasts. Picus' wife (to whom he was wholly devoted) was [[Canens (mythology)|Canens]], a nymph. After Picus' transformation she wandered madly through the forest for 6 days until finally she lay down on the bank of the [[Tiber]] and died. They had one son, [[Faunus]].

According to grammarian [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], Picus's love for [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]] was itself scorned. But in another place he states she consented to marriage, but Circe transformed Picus into a woodpecker and her into a ''pica'', a kind of bird, probably a magpie or an owl.&lt;ref&gt;Servius Ad Aen. 7, 190: "Fabula autem talis est. Picus amavit Pomona, pomorum dea, et eius volentis est sortita coniugium. Postea Circe, cum eum amaret et sperneretur, irata eum in avem, picum Martium, convertit: nam altera est pica...".&lt;/ref&gt; He is featured in one of the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' of [[Ovid]]. [[Virgil]] says that he was the son of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturnus]] and the grandfather of [[Latinus]], the king of the Laurentines whom [[Aeneas]] and his [[Troy|Trojans]] fought upon reaching Italy.

Italic people believed Picus was the son of the god of war [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and attributed his avine transformation to his skills at interpreting bird omens.

One of the functions he performed was to lead the deduction of colonies (made up of younger generation folk) with his flight, which traditionally took place in spring and was performed according to a religious ritual known as [[ver sacrum]]. The people of the [[Piceni]] derived their name from the memory of this ritual.

According to the Roman historian [[Livy]], ''' Jupiter Indiges''' is the name given to the deified hero [[Aeneas]]. In some versions of his story, he is raised up to become a god after his death by [[Numicus]], a local deity of the river of the same name, at the request of Aeneas' mother [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]] Book 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The title '''Pater Indiges''' or simply '''Indiges''' is also used.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] notes that when the body of Aeneas was not found after a battle between his group of Trojan exiles in Italy and the native [[Rutulians]], it was assumed that he had been taken up by the gods to become a deity. He also presents the alternative explanation that Aeneas may have simply drowned in the river [[Numicus]] and that a shrine in his memory was built there.&lt;ref&gt;The Roman Antiquities of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, published in Vol. I of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Indiges", thought by some to be from the same root as "indigenous", may reflect the fact that these minor deities (collectively, the ''[[Di indigetes]]'') originated locally in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities edited William Smith (1870) p. 573&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate explanation is that they were individuals who were raised to the status of gods after mortal life. Compare for example [[Sol Indiges]].

[[File:Design for a Stained Glass Window with Terminus, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|250px|Terminus is often pictured as a bust on a boundary stone, here the {{sm|''concedo nvlli''}} or {{sm|''concedo nulli''}} means "I yield to no one".]]
{{Roman myth (minor)|259px}}
In [[religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], '''Terminus''' was the god who protected [[boundary marker]]s; his name was the [[Latin]] word for such a marker. [[Sacrifice]]s were performed to sanctify each boundary stone, and landowners celebrated a festival called the "[[Terminalia (festival)|Terminalia]]" in Terminus' honor each year on February 23. The [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]] was thought to have been built over a shrine to Terminus, and he was occasionally identified as an aspect of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] under the name "Jupiter Terminalis".

Ancient writers believed that the worship of Terminus had been introduced to [[Rome]] during the reign of the first king [[Romulus]] (traditionally 753&amp;ndash;717 BC) or his successor [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]] (717&amp;ndash;673 BC). Modern scholars have variously seen it as the survival of an early [[animism|animistic]] reverence for the power inherent in the boundary marker, or as the Roman development of [[Proto-Indo-European religion|proto-Indo-European]] belief in a god concerned with the division of property.

==Worship==
The name of the god Terminus was the [[Latin]] word for a boundary stone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Herbert Jennings Rose |author-link=H. J.

These rites were practised by private landowners, but there were also related public ceremonies.

==History==
===Ancient views===
Ancient authors agreed that the worship of Terminus was of [[Sabine]] origin, ascribing its introduction to Rome either to [[Titus Tatius]], the Sabine colleague of Rome's founding king [[Romulus]] (traditional reign 753&amp;ndash;717 BC),&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], ''De Lingua Latina'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/varro.ll5.html 5.10].&lt;/ref&gt; or to Romulus' successor [[Numa Pompilius]] (717&amp;ndash;673 BC).&lt;ref name=dionysius/&gt;&lt;ref name=plutarch&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Roman Questions]]'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/A.html#15 15]; ''[[Parallel Lives|Numa]]'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Numa*.html#16 16].&lt;/ref&gt; Those authors who gave the credit to Numa explained his motivation as the prevention of violent disputes over property.&lt;ref name=dionysius/&gt;&lt;ref name=plutarch/&gt; [[Plutarch]] further states that, in keeping with Terminus's character as a guarantor of peace, his earliest worship did not involve blood sacrifices.&lt;ref name=plutarch/&gt;

The stone in the Capitoline Temple was believed to have been among the altars located on the Capitoline Hill before the Temple was built under [[Tarquinius Priscus]] (traditional reign 616&amp;ndash;579 BC) or [[Tarquinius Superbus]] (535&amp;ndash;510 BC). When the [[augur]]s took the [[auspice]]s to discover whether the god or goddess of each altar was content for it to be moved, Terminus refused permission, either alone or along with [[Juventas]] the goddess of youth. The stone was therefore included within the Capitoline Temple, and its immovability was regarded as a good omen for the permanence of the city's boundaries.&lt;ref name=ovid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Liv.+1.55 1.55]; Dionysius of Halicarnassus, ''Roman Antiquities'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/3D*.html#69.3 3.69.3&amp;ndash;6].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern views===
According to the dominant scholarly view during the late 19th and much of the 20th century, [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] was originally [[animism|animistic]], directed towards spirits associated with specific objects or activities which were only later perceived as gods with independent personal existence. Terminus, with his lack of mythology and his close association with a physical object, seemed a clear example of a deity who had developed little from such a stage.&lt;ref name=Fowler/&gt;

This view of Terminus retains some recent adherents,&lt;ref name=Scullard/&gt; but other scholars have argued from [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] parallels that the personalised gods of Roman religion must have preceded the city's foundation. [[Georges Dumézil]] regarded Jupiter, Juventas and Terminus as the Roman form of a [[Proto-Indo-European religion|proto-Indo-European]] triad, comparing the Roman deities respectively to the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]], [[Aryaman]], and [[Bhaga]]. In this view the sovereign god (Jupiter/Mitra) was associated with two minor deities, one concerned with the entry of men into society (Juventas/Aryaman) and the other with the fair division of their goods (Terminus/Bhaga).&lt;ref name=Dumezil/&gt;

'''Sol Invictus''' ({{IPA-la|s̠ɔːl inˈwik.t̪us̠|classical}}, "Unconquered Sun"), sometimes simply known as [[Helios]], was long considered to be the official [[Solar deity|sun god]] of the later [[Roman Empire]]. In recent years, however, the scholarly community has become divided on Sol between traditionalists and a growing group of revisionists.&lt;ref name=Hijmans-1996&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hijmans |first=Steven |date=1996 |title=The sun that did not rise in the east |journal=Babesch |volume=71 |pages=115–150 |url=https://poj.peeters-leuven.be/content.php?url=issue&amp;journal_code=BAB&amp;issue=0&amp;vol=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional view, ''Sol Invictus'' was the second of two entirely different sun gods in Rome. The first of these, [[Sol (Roman mythology)|''Sol Indiges'']], or ''Sol'', was an early Roman deity of minor importance whose cult had petered out by the first century AD. ''Sol Invictus'', on the other hand, was a Syrian sun god whose cult was first promoted in Rome under [[Elagabalus]], without success. Some fifty years later, on 25 December AD 274, the [[Roman emperor]] [[Aurelian]] established the cult of ''Sol Invictus'' as an [[official religion]], alongside the traditional Roman cults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Sol {{!}} Roman god {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sol-Roman-god |access-date=2022-12-12 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2016-10-21 |title=Sol - Roman God |url=https://mythology.net/roman/roman-gods/sol_roman/ |access-date=2022-12-12 |website=Mythology.net |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Syrian origin of Sol Invictus is undisputed in the traditional view, there has never been consensus on ''which'' Syrian solar deity he was: Some scholars opt for the sky god of Emesa, [[Elagabalus (deity)|Elagabalus]],&lt;ref name=Halsberghe-1972/&gt; while others prefer [[Malakbel]] of Palmyra.&lt;ref name=Oxford-Classical-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wissowa-1912/&gt; There was general agreement that, from Aurelian to [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], Sol was of supreme importance, until Constantine abandoned Sol in favor of Christianity.{{efn|"Up to the conversion of Constantine the Great, the cult of {{sc|Deus Sol Invictus}} received the full support of the emperors: The many coins showing the sun god that these emperors struck provide official evidence of this."&lt;ref name=Halsberghe-1972/&gt;{{rp|page=155}} and "the custom of representing {{sc|Deus Sol Invictus}} on coins came to an end in AD&amp;nbsp;323."&lt;ref name=Halsberghe-1972/&gt;{{rp|page=169}} }} The last inscription referring to Sol Invictus dates to AD&amp;nbsp;387,{{refn|"[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]] {{CIL|6|1778}} dates from AD 387"&lt;ref name=Halsberghe-1972/&gt;{{rp|page=170, n.3}} }} and there were enough devotees in the fifth century that the Christian theologian [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] found it necessary to preach against them.{{refn|Augustine, ''Sermones'', XII;&lt;ref name=Halsberghe-1972/&gt;{{rp|page=170, n.4}} also in ''Ennaratio in Psalmum'' XXV; ''Ennaratio'' II, 3.}}

In the revisionist view, there was only one cult of the Sun God in Rome, continuous from the [[Roman Kingdom|monarchy]] to the [[Late antiquity|end of antiquity]]. This was a Roman god who was simply called Sol. There were at least three temples of the Sun god in Rome, all active during the Empire and all dating from the earlier Republic.&lt;ref name=Hijmans-2010/&gt; They claim that there was never a separate solar deity named ''Sol Invictus''.&lt;ref name=Matern-2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berrens-2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hijmans-2009/&gt;

==''Invictus'' as epithet==
[[File:Stele Sol Invictus Terme.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Dedication made by a priest of [[Jupiter Dolichenus]] on behalf of the well-being ''([[salus]])'' of the emperors, to Sol Invictus and the [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]] of the military unit ''[[equites singulares Augusti]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'' {{CIL|6|31181}} &lt;/ref&gt;]]

''[[Invictus (epithet)|Invictus]]'' ("unconquered, invincible") was an [[epithet]] utilized for several [[List of Roman deities|Roman deities]], including [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Hercules]], [[Apollo]], and [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]].&lt;ref name=Hijmans-1996/&gt;{{rp|page=124}} It had been in use from the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Hijmans-2009/&gt;{{rp|page=18}} The Roman cult to [[Sol (Roman mythology)|Sol]] is continuous from the "earliest history" of the city until the institution of Christianity as the exclusive state religion. Scholars have sometimes regarded the traditional ''Sol Indiges'' and ''Sol Invictus'' as two separate deities, but the rejection of this view by S.&amp;nbsp;E. Hijmans has found supporters.{{refn|Hijmans (2009)&lt;ref name=Hijmans-2009/&gt;{{rp|at=Chapter 1}} (a reworking of Hijmans (1996)); Matern (2001){{full citation|date=June 2021}}; Wallraff (2002){{full citation|date=June 2021}}; and Berrens (2004);&lt;ref name=Berrens-2004/&gt; all follow Hijmans.}}

An inscription of AD&amp;nbsp;102 records a restoration of a portico of Sol in what is now the Trastevere area of Rome by a certain Gaius Iulius Anicetus.&lt;ref name=Hijmans-2009/&gt;{{rp|at=Chapter 5: pp483–508}} While he may have had in mind an allusion to his own ''[[cognomen]]'', which is the Latinized form of the Greek equivalent of ''invictus'', ἀνίκητος (''anikētos''),&lt;ref name=Hijmans-2009/&gt;{{rp|page=486, footnote&amp;nbsp;22}} the earliest extant dated inscription that uses ''invictus'' as an epithet of Sol is from AD&amp;nbsp;158.{{efn|{{sc|Soli Invicto deo / ex voto suscepto / accepta missione / honesta ex nume/ro eq(uitum) sing(ularium) Aug(usti) P(ublius) / Aelius Amandus / d(e)d(icavit) Tertullo et / Sacerdoti co(n)s(ulibus)}}&lt;ref name=CIL-VI-715/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;''Publius Aelius Amandus dedicated this to the god Sol Invictus in accordance with the vow he had made, upon his honorable discharge from the equestrian guard of the emperor, during the consulship of Tertullus and Sacerdos'';&lt;br/&gt; ''see''&lt;ref name=Campbell-1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=Halsberghe-1972/&gt;{{rp|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1doAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Aelius+Amandus%22&amp;dq=%22Aelius+Amandus%22

Sol Invictus played a prominent role in the [[Mithraic mysteries]], and was equated with Mithras.&lt;ref name=Ulansey-1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Salzman-2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alvar-Gordon-2008/&gt; The relation of the Mithraic Sol Invictus to the public cult of the deity with the same name is unclear and perhaps non-existent.&lt;ref name=Alvar-Gordon-2008/&gt;{{rp|page=203}}

== Elagabalus ==
According to the ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'', [[Elagabalus]], the teenaged Severan heir, adopted the name of his deity and brought his cult image from Emesa to Rome. Once installed as emperor, he neglected Rome's traditional State deities and promoted his own as Rome's most powerful deity. This ended with his murder in 222. The ''Historia Augusta'' equates the deity Elagabalus with Jupiter and Sol: ''fuit autem Heliogabali vel Iovis vel Solis sacerdos'', "He was also a priest of Heliogabalus, or [[Jove]], or Sol".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historia Augusta |at=1, 5 |edition=English translation |publisher=Loeb |translator=Thayer |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#note14 |chapter=Latin text |chapter-url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html |via=Penelope, [[University of Chicago]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; While this has been seen as an attempt to import the Syrian sun god to Rome,&lt;ref&gt;See in particular Halsberghe (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; the Roman cult of Sol had existed in Rome at least since the early [[Roman Republic|Republic]].&lt;ref name=Hijmans-1996/&gt;{{refn|&lt;ref&gt;Matern (2001){{full citation|date=June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff (2002){{full citation|date=June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Berrens-2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hijmans-2009/&gt;

== Aurelian ==
[[File:Disc Sol BM GR1899.12-1.2.jpg|thumb|Roman Imperial [[repoussé]] [[silver]] disc of Sol Invictus (3rd century), found at [[Pessinus]] ([[British Museum]])]]

The Roman [[Aurelia (gens)|''gens Aurelia'']] was associated with the cult of Sol.&lt;ref name=Richard-1976/&gt; After his victories in the East, the Emperor [[Aurelian]] thoroughly reformed the Roman cult of Sol, elevating the sun-god to one of the premier divinities of the Empire. Where previously priests of Sol had been simply ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sacerdotes]]'' and tended to belong to lower ranks of Roman society,&lt;ref name=Hijmans-2009/&gt;{{rp|pages=504–505}} they were now ''pontifices'' and members of the new [[College of Pontiffs|college of pontifices]] instituted by Aurelian. Every pontifex of Sol was a member of the senatorial elite, indicating that the priesthood of Sol was now highly prestigious. Almost all these senators held other priesthoods as well, however, and some of these other priesthoods take precedence in the inscriptions in which they are listed, suggesting that they were considered more prestigious than the priesthood of Sol.{{efn|For a full list of the pontifices of Sol see J.&amp;nbsp;Rupke (ed.), ''Fasti Sacerdotum'' (2005), p. 606. [[Memmius Vitrasius Orfitus]] lists his priesthoods as pontifex of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], one of the [[quindecimviri sacris faciundis]], and pontifex of Sol, in that order.&lt;ref name=CIL-VI-1739–1742/&gt; In a list of eight priesthoods, [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus]] puts ''Pontifex Solis'' in third place.&lt;ref name=CIL-VI-1779/&gt;}} Aurelian also built a new [[Temple of the Sun (Rome)|temple for Sol]], which was dedicated on 25&amp;nbsp;December 274,&lt;ref name=Clauss-2001&gt;{{cite book |last=Clauss |first=Manfred |title=Die römischen Kaiser – 55&amp;nbsp;historische Portraits von Caesar bis Iustinian |year=2001 |isbn=978-3-406-47288-6 |page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; and brought the total number of temples for the god in Rome to (at least) four.{{efn|The other three were in the [[Circus Maximus]], on the [[Quirinal]], and in [[Trastevere]].&lt;ref name=Hijmans-2009/&gt;{{rp|at=Chapter&amp;nbsp;5}} }} He also instituted games in honor of the sun god, held every four years from 274 onwards.

The identity of Aurelian's Sol Invictus has long been a subject of scholarly debate. Based on the ''[[Augustan History]]'', some scholars have argued that it was based on [[Elagabalus (deity)|Sol Elagablus]] (or Elagabla) of [[Emesa]]. Others, basing their argument on [[Zosimus (historian)|Zosimus]], suggest that it was based on the [[Shamash|Šams]], the solar god of [[Palmyra]] on the grounds that Aurelian placed and consecrated a cult statue of the sun god looted from Palmyra in the temple of Sol Invictus.&lt;ref name=Dirven-1999/&gt; Forsythe (2012)&lt;ref name=Forsythe-2012/&gt; discusses these arguments and adds a third more recent one, based on the work of Steven Hijmans. Hijmans argues that Aurelian's solar deity was simply the traditional Greco-Roman {{sc|Sol Invictus}}.&lt;ref name=Forsythe-2012/&gt;

== Constantine ==

Emperors portrayed {{sc|Sol Invictus}} on their official coinage, with a wide range of legends, only a few of which incorporated the epithet {{sc|invictus}}, such as the legend {{sc|SOLI INVICTO COMITI}}, claiming the "Unconquered Sun" as a companion to the Emperor, used with particular frequency by Constantine.{{efn|A comprehensive discussion of all sol-coinage and sol-legends per emperor from [[Septimius Severus]] to [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] can be found in Berrens (2004).&lt;ref name=Berrens-2004/&gt;}} Statuettes of Sol Invictus, carried by the standard-bearers, appear in three places in reliefs on the [[Arch of Constantine]]. Constantine's official coinage continues to bear images of Sol until 325/326. A [[solidus (coin)|solidus]] of Constantine as well as a gold medallion from his reign depict the Emperor's bust in profile twinned ([[jugate]]) with Sol Invictus, with the legend {{sc|INVICTUS CONSTANTINUS}}{{efn|The medal is illustrated in Toynbee (1944);&lt;ref name=Toynbee-1944/&gt; the solidus is illustrated in Maurice (n.d.)&lt;ref name=Maurice-nd/&gt;}}

Connections between the imperial [[radiate crown]] and the cult of Sol are postulated. [[Augustus]] was posthumously depicted with radiate crown, as were living emperors from [[Nero]] (after AD 65) to [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. Some modern scholarship interprets the imperial radiate crown as a divine, solar association rather than an overt symbol of Sol; Bergmann calls it a pseudo-object designed to disguise the divine and solar connotations that would otherwise be politically controversial&lt;ref name=Bergmann-1998/&gt;{{rp|pages=121–123}}&lt;ref name=Hijmans-2003-2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hijmans-2009/&gt;{{rp|pages=80–84, 509–548}} but there is broad agreement that coin-images showing the imperial radiate crown are stylistically distinct from those of the solar crown of rays; the imperial radiate crown is depicted as a real object rather than as symbolic light.&lt;ref name=Bergmann-1998/&gt;{{rp|pages=116–117}}&lt;ref name=Hijmans-2009/&gt;{{rp|pages=82–83}}

Hijmans argues that the Imperial radiate crown represents the honorary wreath awarded to [[Augustus]], perhaps posthumously, to commemorate his victory at the [[Battle of Actium]]; he points out that henceforth, living emperors were depicted with radiate crowns, but state ''divi'' were not. Hijmans believes this implies that the radiate crown of living emperors is a symbolic link to Augustus. His successors automatically inherited (or sometimes acquired) the same offices and honours due to Octavian as "saviour of the Republic" through his victory at Actium, piously attributed to [[Apollo]]-[[Helios]].

Furthermore, radiate crowns were not solely worn by emperors: The wreaths awarded to victors at the [[Actia|Actian Games]] were radiate.{{efn|&lt;ref name=Hijmans-2009/&gt;{{rp|pages=509–548}} A mosaic floor in the Baths of the Porta Marina at Ostia depicts a radiate victory crown on a table as well as a victorious competitor wearing one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ostia-antica.org/regio4/10/10-1.htm |title=Regio IV – Insula X – Terme di Porta Marina (IV, X, 1–2) |access-date=2009-11-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109062717/http://www.ostia-antica.org/regio4/10/10-1.htm |archive-date=2008-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Festival of Dies Natalis Solis Invicti==
[[File:Lucretia2.jpg|thumb|Coin depicting Sol / crescent moon and seven stars]]

The [[Chronography of 354|Philocalian calendar]] of AD&amp;nbsp;354, part VI, gives a festival of {{sc|Natalpubeis Invicti}} on 25&amp;nbsp;December. There is limited evidence that this festival was celebrated before the mid-4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff (2001) 174–177 {{full citation| date=June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"An inscription of unique interest from the reign of Licinius embodies the official prescription for the annual celebration by his army of a festival of Sol Invictus on December&amp;nbsp;19".&lt;ref&gt;Hoey (1939) 480 {{full citation| date=June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription&lt;ref name=Dessau-nd/&gt; actually prescribes an annual offering to Sol on ''November''&amp;nbsp;18 ({{sc|die XIV Kal(endis) Decemb(ribus)}}, i.e., on the fourteenth day before the Kalends of December).}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online text of inscription, Parts&amp;nbsp;6 and 12 |website=tertullian.org |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/index.htm#Chronography_of_354 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204204128/http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/index.htm |archive-date=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same [[Chronograph of 354|Philocalian calendar]], part&amp;nbsp;VIII, also mentions the [[nativity of Jesus|birth of Jesus Christ]], stating that the "Lord Jesus Christ was born eight days before the [[calends]] of January" (that is, on December&amp;nbsp;25).

Since the 12th&amp;nbsp;century,&lt;ref name=MacMullen-1997/&gt; there have been speculations that the near-solstice date of 25&amp;nbsp;December for [[Christmas]] was selected because it was the date of the [[Roman festival|festival]] of {{sc|Dies Natalis Solis Invicti}}, but historians of late antiquity make no mention of this, and others speculate [[Aurelian]] chose December&amp;nbsp;25 to shadow early Christian celebrations already on the rise.&lt;ref name=McGowan-2002-12/&gt;

==Legacy ==
=== Christianity ===
According to some historians, [[Christmas#Solstice date hypothesis|Christmas was set to December 25th]] because it was the date of the festival of Sol Invictus. This idea became popular especially in the 18th&lt;ref name=Tylor-1889/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schaff-1885-1910/&gt; and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name=Anderson-2008/&gt;{{rp|page=45}}&lt;ref name=Melkite-2012-03-25-Flesh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Catholic-Encyclopedia-1908/&gt; 

The charioteer in the mosaic of [[Tomb of the Julii|Mausoleum M]] has been interpreted by some as Christ. [[Clement of Alexandria]] had spoken of Christ driving his chariot across the sky.&lt;ref name=Webb-2001/&gt; This interpretation is doubted by others: "Only the ''cross-shaped'' nimbus makes the Christian significance apparent",&lt;ref name=Kemp-2000/&gt; and the figure is seen by some simply as a representation of the Sun with no explicit religious reference whatever, pagan or Christian.&lt;ref name=Hijmans-2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hijmans-2009/&gt;{{rp|pages=567-578}}

===Judaism===
[[File:Beit alfa01.jpg|thumb|Mosaic in the [[Beth Alpha]] synagogue, with the Sun in the centre, surrounded by the twelve zodiac constellations and with the four seasons associated inaccurately with the constellations]]
The traditional image of the Sun has also been used in early Jewish prophecy, poetry, and art. [[Psalm 19]], begins "The heavens proclaim the glory of God, the firmament proclaims his handiwork", and likens the Sun to a bridegroom, to a warrior, and to the [[Torah]].

An [[Aggada|Aggadic]] legend found in tractate [[Avodah Zarah]] 8a contains the [[Christmas#Talmudic hypothesis|talmudic hypothesis]] that [[Adam#Adam and the winter solstice|Adam]] the first established the tradition of fasting before the [[winter solstice#Judaic|winter solstice]], and rejoicing afterward, which festival later devolved into the Roman [[Saturnalia#Jewish|Saturnalia]] and Calenda.

A mosaic floor in [[Hamat Tiberias]] presents [[King David|David]] as Helios surrounded by a ring with the signs of the [[zodiac]].&lt;ref name=Cartlidge-Elliott-2001/&gt; As well as in Hamat Tiberias, figures of Helios or Sol Invictus also appear in several of the very few surviving schemes of decoration surviving from Late Antique [[synagogue]]s, including [[Beth Alpha]], Husefa, all now in [[Israel]], and [[Naaran]] in the West Bank. He is shown in floor mosaics, with the usual radiate halo, and sometimes in a [[quadriga]], in the central roundel of a circular representation of the zodiac or the seasons. These combinations "may have represented to an agricultural Jewish community the perpetuation of the annual cycle of the universe or ... the central part of a calendar".

[[File:Hercules killing Cacus at his Cave.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Hercules killing the fire-breathing Cacus, [[engraving]] by [[Sebald Beham]] (1545)]]
In [[Roman mythology]], '''Cacus''' ({{lang-grc|Κάκος}},&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0572%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D39%3Asection%3D2 Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, 1.39.2]&lt;/ref&gt; derived from κακός, meaning bad) was a [[fire-breathing monster|fire-breathing]] [[giant]] and the son of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] ([[Plutarch]] called him son of [[Hephaestus]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg113.perseus-grc1:18 Plutarch, Of Love, Moralia, 18]&lt;/ref&gt; He was killed by [[Hercules]] after terrorizing the [[Aventine Hill]] before the [[founding of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CACUS: Giant of the Land of Latium|url=http://www.theoi.com/Gigante/GiganteKakos.html|publisher=theoi.com|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
Cacus lived in a cave in [[Italy]] on the future site of [[Rome]]. To the horror of nearby inhabitants, Cacus lived on human flesh and would nail the heads of victims to the doors of his cave. He was eventually overcome by Hercules.

According to [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]], Cacus lived in a place called Salinae, which later became the location of the [[Porta Trigemina]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/747#1.7 Solinus, Polyhistor, 1.7]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]], Hercules stopped to pasture the [[cattle]] he had stolen from [[Geryon]] near Cacus' lair. As Hercules slept, the monster took a liking to the cattle and slyly stole eight of them – four bulls and four cows – by dragging them by their tails, so as to leave a trail in the wrong direction. When Hercules awoke and made to leave, the remaining herd made plaintive noises towards the cave, and a single cow lowed in reply.

Angered, Hercules stormed towards the cave. A terrified Cacus blocked the entrance with a vast, immoveable boulder (though some incarnations have Hercules himself block the entrance) forcing Hercules to tear at the top of the mountain to reach his adversary. Cacus attacked Hercules by spewing fire and smoke, while Hercules responded with tree branches and rocks the size of millstones. Eventually losing patience, Hercules leapt into the cave, aiming for the area where the smoke was heaviest. Hercules grabbed Cacus and strangled the monster, and was praised throughout the land for his act. According to [[Virgil]] in Book VIII of the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Hercules grasped Cacus so tightly that Cacus' eyes popped out and there was no blood left in his throat: ''et angit inhaerens elisos oculos et siccum sanguine guttur''.

[[Image:Firenze.Hercules01.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Hercules and Cacus]]  by [[Baccio Bandinelli]] (1525–34); ([[Palazzo Vecchio, Florence]])]]
Another version of the myth states that Cacus made the cattle walk backwards so they left a false trail. Hercules drove his remaining cattle past a cave, where Cacus was hiding the stolen ones, and they began calling out to each other. Alternatively, [[Caca (mythology)|Caca]], Cacus' sister, told Hercules where he was.

According to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], when the [[Aborigines (mythology)|Aborigines]] and the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadians]] who lived at [[Pallantium]] learned of the death of Cacus and saw Hercules, they thought themselves very fortunate in being rid of the former, they were plucking branches of [[Laurus nobilis|laurel]], crowned both him and themselves with it and their kings invite Hercules to be their guest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0081.tlg001.perseus-grc1:1.40.1 Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, 1.40.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Roman tradition, Hercules founded an altar after he killed Cacus. [[Eusebius]] writes that Heracles erected an altar in the Forum Boarium, to commemorate his killing of Cacus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/531#106 Eusebius, Chronography, 106]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', the Arcadian King [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]] recounts this story&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Aeneid]]'', Book VIII&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Aeneas]] to explain the rites the people perform yearly to Hercules. This was the  [[Ara Maxima]], where later the [[Forum Boarium]], the cattle market of Rome, was held. Hercules had [[Roman temple|temples]] in the area, including the still extant [[Temple of Hercules Victor]].

==In later literature==
* In the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]], Cacus is depicted as a [[centaur]] with a fire-breathing [[dragon]] on his shoulders and [[snake]]s covering his equine back. He guards over the thieves in the Thieves section of [[Hell]]'s Circle of Fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Dante ''Inferno'' 25.17–33&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Miguel de Cervantes]] in his 1605 novel ''[[Don Quixote]]'' describes the inn keeper in the second chapter of part one "The First Sally from his Native Heath" as "No less a thief than Cacus himself, and as full of tricks as a student or a page boy."&lt;ref&gt;Miguel De Cervantes, ''Don Quixote de la Mancha'' New York. Random House 1949 p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Cervantes also mentions Cacus as a prototypical thief in a comparison in the sixth chapter of ''Don Quixote'' part one, "The Scrutiny of the Curate and the Barber" when the Curate says "Here we have Sir Rindaldo of Montalbán with his friends and companions, bigger thieves than Cacus, all of them ..." The comparison is a slight on Rinaldo, as he had written a book ''The Mirror of Chivalry'' which the Curate and the Barber agree caused, in part, Don Quixote's descent into madness.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel De Cervantes, ''Don Quixote de la Mancha'' New York. Random House 1949 pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[A Letter to a Friend]]'' [[Sir Thomas Browne]] compares the reluctance with which old people go to the grave with the backwards movements of Cacus' oxen.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas Browne ''Sir Thomas Browne's Religio Medici, Letter to a Friend and Christian Morals'' London. Macmillan 1898 p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cacus is described as a deformed outcast from an Italian village, able only to say "Cacus", in [[Steven Saylor]]'s novel ''[[Roma (2007 novel)|Roma]]'', playing a direct role in the events of the main character of the era.
* [[Lavinia]], in [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s 2008 novel ''[[Lavinia (novel)|Lavinia]]'', describes Cacus as a "fire lord, the chief man of a tribal settlement, who kept [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] alight for the people of the neighborhood, with the help of his [[Vestals|daughters]]." Lavinia comments that the Greeks' story of the beast-man "was more exciting than mine."
* Cacus appears as the main antagonist in [[Rick Riordan]]'s short story in ''[[The Demigod Diaries]]'' titled "The Staff of Hermes". There were references to Cacus' fight with Hercules in that story. In the story, Cacus had stolen Hermes' Caduceus. He later attacked Percy Jackson and Annabeth Chase. Annabeth hit Cacus with her metal claw and Percy killed Cacus with Hermes' Caduceus.
* In the second book of ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'', Cacus is said to be begotten by [[Polyphemus]] the Cyclops. He is also said to be the giant who fathered Etion.

== In modern languages ==
In the Spanish language, the derived form ''caco''&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;[http://dle.rae.es/?id=6ZYXQcv caco] in the [[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a colloquial word for "thief" and a disused word for a very cowardly man.

'''Adranus''' or '''Adranos''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀδρανός}}) was a fire god worshipped by the [[Sicels]], an ancient population of the island of [[Sicily]].  His worship occurred all over the island, but particularly in the town of Adranus, modern [[Adrano]], near [[Mount Etna]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Timoleon]]'' 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], xiv. 37&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], about a thousand sacred dogs were kept near his temple in this town.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''Hist. Anim.'' xi. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  

Adranus  was said to have lived under [[Mount Etna]] before being driven out by the Greek god [[Hephaestus]], or [[Vulcan (god)|Vulcan]]. According to [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]], Adranus was the father of the [[Palici]], born to Adranus' lover, the [[nymph]] [[Thalia (nymph)|Thalia]].

Some modern commentators have suggested that Adranus may have been related to the similarly named gods [[Atar#In culture and tradition|Adar]] and [[Adrammelech]], from [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] and [[Phoenicia]] respectively, who were also personifications of the sun or of fire in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard  | contribution = Adranus  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 20  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0029.html  | access-date = 2007-10-15  | archive-date = 2005-12-18  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051218152312/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0029.html  | url-status = dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman mythology]] and [[Roman religion|religion]], '''Quirinus''' ({{IPAc-en|k|w|ɪ|ˈ|r|aɪ|n|ə|s}} {{respell|kwi|RY|nəs}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/quirinus?showCookiePolicy=true |title=Quirinus |access-date=24 September 2014 |dictionary=Collins Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-la|kᶣɪˈriːnʊs|lang}}) is an early god of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman state]]. In [[Augustus|Augustan]] Rome, ''Quirinus'' was also an [[epithet]] of [[Janus]], as ''Janus Quirinus''.&lt;ref&gt;In the prayer of the [[fetiales]] quoted by [[Livy]] (I.32.10); [[Macrobius]] (''Sat.'' I.9.15);&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==

===Attestations===
The name of god Quirinus is recorded across Roman sources as ''Curinus'', ''Corinus'', ''Querinus'', ''Queirinus'' and ''QVIRINO'', also as fragmented ''IOVI. CYRIN[O]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dupraz, Emmanuel. ''Les Vestins à l'époque tardo-républicaine. Du nord-osque au latin''. France, Rouen: Publications des Universités de Rouen et du Havre. 2010. pp. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is also attested as a surname to [[Hercules]] as ''Hercules Quirinus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lajoye |first1=Patrice |title=Quirinus, un ancien dieu tonnant ? Nouvelles hypothèses sur son étymologie et sa nature primitive |journal=Revue de l'histoire des religions |date=1 June 2010 |volume=227 |issue=227 |pages=175–194 |doi=10.4000/rhr.7573 |jstor=23618183 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The name ''Quirīnus'' probably stems from Latin ''[[Quirites|quirīs]]'', the name of Roman citizens in their peacetime function. Since both ''quirīs'' and ''Quirīnus'' are connected with Sabellic immigrants into Rome in ancient legends, it may be a loanword.{{Sfn|de Vaan|2008|p=|pp=509–510}} The meaning "wielder of the spear" (Sabine ''quiris'', 'spear', cf. ''Janus Quirinus''), or a derivation from the Sabine town of [[Cures, Sabinum|Cures]], have been proposed by [[Ovid]] in his ''[[Fasti (poem)|''Fasti'']]'' 2.477-480.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Quirinus|volume=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source needed|date=April 2020}}

Some scholars have interpreted the name as a contraction of ''*Co-Virīnus'' (originally the protector of the community, cf. [[Curia|''cūria'']] &lt; ''*co-viria''), descending from an earlier *''Co-Wironos'', itself from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] noun ''{{PIE|*wihₓrós}}'' ("man").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Puhvel|first=Jaan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zt4nAAAAYAAJ|title=Comparative mythology|date=1987|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-3413-4|pages=289|language=en|author-link=Jaan Puhvel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|last=Matasović|first=Ranko|author-link=Ranko Matasović|date=2010|title=A Reader in Comparative Mythology|url=http://mudrac.ffzg.unizg.hr/~rmatasov/PIE%20Religion.pdf|publisher=University of Zagreb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Michiel de Vaan]] argues that this etymology "is not credible phonetically and not very compelling semantically."{{Sfn|de Vaan|2008|p=|pp=509–510}}

==Depiction and worship==
{{further|Ancient Roman religion|Flamen Quirinalis#Quirinalia}}
[[File:Numerius Fabius Pictor, denarius, 126 BC, RRC 268-1b.jpg|thumb|[[Denarius]] of 126 BC; on the right is the ''flamen Quirinalis'' with ''QVIRIN'' on his shield.]]
In earlier Roman [[art]], Quirinus was portrayed as a bearded man with religious and military clothing. However, he was almost never depicted in later [[Roman art]].{{Why|date=August 2022}} His main [[festival]] was the '''Quirinalia''', held on February&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;ref name="StultorumFeriae" /&gt;

The priest of Quirinus, the ''[[Flamen Quirinalis]]'', was one of the three patrician ''flamines maiores'' ("major [[flamen]]s") who had precedence over the [[Pontifex Maximus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Sextus Pompeius Festus |author=Festus |title=De Verborum Significatione |title-link=De Verborum Significatione |at=198, L |quote=''Quirinalis, socio imperii Romani Curibus ascito Quirino''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Quirinus most likely was originally a [[Sabines|Sabine]] war god. The Sabines had a settlement near the eventual site of [[Rome]], and erected an altar to Quirinus on the ''Collis Quirinalis'' [[Quirinal Hill]], one of the [[Seven hills of Rome]]. When the Romans settled in the area, the cult of Quirinus became part of their early belief system. This occurred before the later influences from classical Greek culture.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

===Deified Romulus===
In [[Plutarch]]'s [[Parallel Lives|''Life of Romulus'']], he writes that shortly after Rome's founder had disappeared under what some considered suspicious circumstances, a Roman noble named [[Proculus Julius]] reported that [[Romulus]] had come to him while he was travelling. He claimed that the king had instructed him to tell his countrymen that he, Romulus was Quirinus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Plutarch |author=Plutarch |title=Lives |chapter=Romulus |at=ch.&amp;nbsp;28 p.&amp;nbsp;2 |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/romulus*.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 1st&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BCE, Quirinus would be considered to be the [[Apotheosis#Ancient Rome|deified]] legendary king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fishwich, Duncan |title=The Imperial Cult in the Latin West |publisher=Brill |edition=2nd |year=1993 |isbn=978-90-04-07179-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4II_mqxM8s0C&amp;q=romulus+quirinus&amp;pg=PA53 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Evans, Jane de&amp;nbsp;Rose |title=The Art of Persuasion |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-472-10282-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AsRrF3ej38C&amp;q=romulus+quirinus&amp;pg=PA103 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brelich's argument for split deification===
Historian Angelo Brelich argued that Quirinus and [[Romulus]] were originally the same divine entity which was split into a founder hero and a god when Roman religion became demythicised. To support this, he points to the association of both Romulus and Quirinus with the grain [[spelt]], through the ''[[Fornacalia]]'' or ''Stultorum Feriae'', according to Ovid's ''Fasti''.&lt;ref name=StultorumFeriae&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Ovid |author=Ovid |title=Fasti |at=II, 481&amp;nbsp;ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last day of the festival is called the ''[[Quirinalia]]'' and corresponds with the traditional day of Romulus' death. On that day, the Romans would toast spelt as an offering to the goddess [[Fornax (mythology)|Fornax]]. In one version of the legend of Romulus' death cited by Plutarch, he was killed and cut into pieces by the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|nobles]] and each of them took a part of his body home and buried it on their land.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

Brelich claimed this pattern – a festival involving a staple crop, a god, and a tale of a slain founding hero whose body parts are buried in the soil – is a recognized [[mytheme]] that arises when such a split takes place in a culture's mythology (see ''[[Dema deity]]'' archetype). The possible presence of the ''[[Flamen Quirinalis]]'' at the festival of [[Acca Larentia]] would corroborate this thesis, given the fact that Romulus is a stepson of hers, and one of the original twelve arval brethren ([[Fratres Arvales]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aulus Gellius |title=Noctes Atticae |at=7.7.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Grabovian pantheon===
The association of Quirinus and Romulus is further supported by a connection with Vofionos, the third god in the triad of the Grabovian gods of [[Iguvium]]. Vofionos would be the equivalent of [[Liber]] or [[Teutates]], in [[Latium]] and among the [[Celts]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Angelo |last=Brelich |title=Quirinus: una divinita' romana alla luce della comparazione storica |series=Studi e Materiali di Storia delle religioni |year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Capitoline Triad===
His early importance led to Quirinus' inclusion in the [[Archaic Triad]] (the first [[Capitoline Triad]]), along with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] (then an agriculture god) and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Inez Scott |last=Ryberg |title=Was the Capitoline Triad Etruscan or Italic? |journal=The American Journal of Philology |volume=52 |issue=2 |year=1931 |pages=145–156|doi=10.2307/290109 |jstor=290109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, however, Quirinus became less significant, and he was absent from the later, more widely known triad (he and Mars had been replaced by [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]]). [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] mentions the ''Capitolium Vetus'', an earlier cult site on the Quirinal, devoted to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Varro |author=Varro |title=De lingua latina |at=V.158}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The Capitolium Vetus was demolished in 1625 by order of Pope Barberini.&lt;ref&gt;See Lanciani's work on the "Shrines of Pagan Rome".&lt;/ref&gt;}} among whom [[Martial]] makes a distinction between the "old Jupiter" and the "new".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Martial |author=Martial |title=Epigrams |volume=V |at=22.4 |quote=Martial remarks on a position on the [[Esquiline Hill]] from which one might see ''hinc novum Iovem, inde veterem'', "here the new Jupiter, there the old."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fade into obscurity===
Eventually, Romans began to favor personal and mystical cults over the official state belief system. These included those of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], [[Cybele]], and [[Isis]], leaving only Quirinus' flamen to worship him.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

===Legacy===
Even centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire, the [[Quirinal]] hill in Rome, originally named from the deified [[Romulus]], was still associated with power – it was chosen as the seat of the royal house after the taking of Rome by the [[House of Savoy|Savoia]] and later it became the residence of the [[President of Italy|Presidents of the Italian Republic]].{{cn|date=August 2022}}

[[File:Pales Godinnen en nimfen (serietitel), RP-P-1986-363.jpg|thumb]]
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''Pales''' was a deity of shepherds, flocks and livestock. Regarded as male by some sources and female by others, ''Pales'' can be either singular or plural in [[Latin]], and refers at least once to a pair of deities.

Pales' festival, called the [[Parilia]], was celebrated on April 21. Cattle were driven through bonfires on this day. Pales and the Parilia were strictly connected to the foundation of Rome which took place on the day of their festival.

[[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] built a temple to Pales in [[Rome]] following his victory over the [[Salento|Salentini]] in 267 BC. It is generally thought to have been located on the [[Palatine Hill]], but, being a victory monument, it may have been located on the route of the [[Roman triumph|triumphal]] procession, either on the [[Campus Martius]] or the [[Aventine Hill]]. According to the ''[[Fasti Antiates Maiores]]'', there was a festival for "the two Pales" (''Palibus duobus'') on July 7, probably to mark the dedication of this temple.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarship has suggested the Pales deities are related to Sicilian pair of gods [[Palici]], and both sets of brother may be reflexes of the [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Indo-European]] [[mytheme]] of the [[Divine twins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witczak|first=Krzysztof T.|date=1999|title=On the Indo-European origin of two Lusitanian theonyms (''laebo'' and ''reve'')|journal=Emerita|language=en|volume=67|issue=1|pages=65–73|doi=10.3989/emerita.1999.v67.i1.185|issn=1988-8384|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Roman religion}}

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], the god '''Consus''' was the protector of grains. He was represented by a grain seed.&lt;ref name=Colchester-2014-12-12/&gt; His altar ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ara|ara]])''&lt;ref name=Lipka-2009/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|page= 42}} was located at the first ''meta'' of the [[Circus Maximus]].&lt;ref name=Aldington-Ames-1968/&gt; It was either underground, or according to other sources, covered with earth, which was swept off during the two [[Consualia]], his festivals on August&amp;nbsp;21,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; December&amp;nbsp;15,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref name=Colchester-2014-12-12/&gt; and on July&amp;nbsp;7 when the pontiffs held a sacrifice there.&lt;ref name=Tertullian-V-7/&gt; He was thus a [[chthonic]] god.&lt;ref name=Lipka-2009/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|page= 42}}

The ''[[Flamen Quirinalis]]'' and the [[Vestals]] officiated at his rites.{{refn|Lipka (2009),&lt;ref name=Lipka-2009/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|page=57}} who cites [[Tertullian]].&lt;ref name=Tertullian-V-7/&gt;}}

== Etymology ==
The [[etymology]] of the name ''Consus'' is uncertain. It may be of [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] or [[Sabine language|Sabine]] origin. In the [[folk etymology]] of antiquity,&lt;ref name=delBello-2007/&gt; the name was related to the Latin verb ''conserere'', "to sow," as was the title of the goddess [[Ops]] as ''Consivia'' or ''Consiva''.

The [[Roman Republic|late Republican]] theologian [[Varro]] said that the Consualia were named for Consus.&lt;ref name=Varro-consualia/&gt; [[Georges Dumézil|G. Dumézil]]&lt;ref name=Dumézil-1977/&gt; and G. Capdeville&lt;ref name=Capdeville-1973/&gt; consider verb ''condere'',&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; "to store", to be the best etymology: ''Consus'' would be an archaic verbal noun denoting the action of storing grain.

Capdeville states that ''Consus'' cannot be related to ''conserere'' and adjective ''consivius'', and advances the hypothesis that ''condere'' might have to be taken in the meaning of "to found" or "establish".&lt;ref name=Capdeville-1973/&gt;&lt;ref name=Capdeville-1993/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|page= 177, note&amp;nbsp;140}}

Ancient sources, [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] included, were very fond of the similar sound of ''Consus'' and ''consilium'', and allegorically interpreted his name&lt;ref name=delBello-2007/&gt; as relating to "council" or "assembly" (''consilium'').
Moreover, [[Tertullian]] reports that on one of the ''metae'' of the [[circus maximus]] an inscription read: "''Consus consilio, Mars duello, Lares coillo po[tentes]''".&lt;ref name=Tertullian-V-7/&gt; which may be archaic  considering ''co[v]illo'' and external factors. This is close to "hide" too cf. ''abdere, (abs)condere''. This derivation is certain, but on the other hand, as de&amp;nbsp;Vaan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=de&amp;nbsp;Vaan, M. |title=Etymological Dictionary of Latin and Italic Languages |place=Leyden |year=2010 |at=s.v.}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes on the etymology of ''consilium'', it is very uncertain whence comes the head word, ''consulere-solere'', although very probably not from ''con-sideo''.

==Function and associations==
The festivals of Ops ([[Opiconsivia]] or [[Opalia]]) followed Consus' closely, being held every August&amp;nbsp;25 and December&amp;nbsp;19, at the time of reaping and the seeding of crops.

Consus became a god associated with secret conferences. The grammarian [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] says that Consus is the god of councils.&lt;ref name=Servius/&gt; This fact stems from the role played by Consus in the abduction of the Sabine women, which took place on the occasion of the ''Consualia aestiva'' and was considered to have been advised by the god himself.
This power of hidden counselling held by Consus seems to be related to the concept expressed by Dionysius and Plutarch that he is the "holder" of the Earth, an idea that makes of him a parallel to [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]].

So although it is certain that ''condere'' and ''consulere'' are from two different roots, it looks the character of Consus as hidden master of the Earth was at the basis of the identification with [[Neptune]], as well as the strict affinity of the two gods with the horse.

According to G. Capdeville, it was a customary event that games were held at the foundation of a new settlement. These were connected with rituals that included athletic games such as footraces and marriage games along with invitations to settle in the new town: He mentions the instances of [[Caeculus]] at [[Praeneste]] and other settlements in Crete ([[Dreros]], [[Hierapytna]], [[Praisos]], [[Lyttos]], [[Knossos]]). These events all had a religious meaning. In Crete as well as in Rome it looks the god involved was Vulcan ({{math|Bελχάνος}}), i.e. the [[Zeus#Zeus Velchanos|Cretan ''megas Kouros'']], later interpreted as [[Zeus]]. In Rome the relationship of Vulcan with Consus is apparent in the dates of their festivals and the fact that the ''flamen volcanalis'' officiated at the [[Calends]] of May the sacrifice to [[Bona Dea]].

Consus is perhaps to be identified with "Equestrian Neptune" (''[[Neptunus Equestris]]'').&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Mule or horse races were the main event of the festival.&lt;ref name=Aldington-Ames-1968/&gt; During the festival horses and mules were garlanded with flowers, and given a rest from work.&lt;ref name=Aldington-Ames-1968/&gt; This fact is ascribed by Capdeville to the fact that [[Poseidon]] was the successor of the unknown god of the Arcadian Hippocrateia mentioned by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], who himself was perhaps the successor of a horse god.&lt;ref name=Capdeville-1993/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|page= 178, note&amp;nbsp;141}} A close connection of Consus with the two [[Pales]] and of both with the horse looks apparent.{{refn|Capdeville (1993)&lt;ref name=Capdeville-1993/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|page= 180, note&amp;nbsp;149}} also citing&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dumézil, G. |author-link=Georges Dumézil |title={{grey|[article on the mare Viśpala of the RgVeda]}} |journal=Eranos |year=1956}}{{full citation|date=September 2022}} }}

[[File:Pompeji Penis Sign.jpg|thumb|150px|Phallus inscribed on a paving stone at [[Pompeii]]]]

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] and [[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]], the '''''fascinus''''' or '''''fascinum''''' was the embodiment of the divine [[phallus]]. The word can refer to phallus [[effigy|effigies]] and [[amulet]]s, and to the spells used to invoke his divine protection.&lt;ref&gt;The [[grammatical gender|neuter]] form ''fascinum'' is used most often for objects or magic charms, masculine ''fascinus'' for the god.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] calls it a ''medicus invidiae'', a "doctor" or remedy for envy (''[[invidia]]'', a "looking upon") or the [[evil eye]].

==Etymology==
The English word "[[wikt:fascinate|fascinate]]" ultimately derives from Latin ''[[wikt:fascinum|fascinum]]'' and the related verb ''fascinare'', "to use the power of the ''fascinus''", that is, "to practice magic" and hence "to enchant, bewitch". [[Catullus]] uses the verb at the end of ''Carmen 7'', a [[hendecasyllable|hendecasyllabic]] poem addressing his lover Lesbia; he expresses his infinite desire for kisses that cannot be counted by voyeurs nor "fascinated" (put under a spell) by a malicious tongue; such bliss, as also in ''Carmen'' 5, potentially attracts ''invidia''.&lt;ref&gt;David Wray, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6Qg3kYF-WS4C&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=fascinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1988&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=14#v=onepage&amp;q=fascinus&amp;f=false ''Catullus and the Poetics of Roman Manhood''] (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fescennine Verses]], the satiric and often lewd songs or chants performed on various social occasions, may have been so-named from the ''fascinum''; ancient sources propose this etymology along with an alternative origin from [[Fescennia]], a small town in [[Etruria]].&lt;ref&gt;Gian Biagio Conte, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJGp_dkXnuUC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=fascinum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1988&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=172#v=onepage&amp;q=fascinum&amp;f=false ''Latin Literature: A History''] (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987, 1994), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vestal Virgin]]s tended the cult of the ''fascinus [[SPQR|populi Romani]]'', the sacred image of the phallus that was one of the tokens of the safety of the state ''(sacra Romana)''. It was thus associated with the [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|Palladium]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Joy Littlewood, ''A [[Commentary (philology)|Commentary]] on [[Ovid]]:'' Fasti ''Book 6'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 73; [[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 61 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7LPNHRUlWacC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=fascinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1988&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=68#v=onepage&amp;q=fascinus&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman mythology|Roman myths]], such as the begetting of [[Servius Tullius]], suggest that this phallus was an embodiment of a masculine generative power located within the hearth, regarded as sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rykwert, ''The Idea of a Town: The Anthropology of Urban Form in Rome, Italy, and the Ancient World'' (MIT Press, 1988), pp. 101 and 159 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jq78Ff2TYHAC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=fascinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1988&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=fascinus&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; When a general celebrated a [[Roman triumph|triumph]], the Vestals hung an effigy of the ''fascinus'' on the underside of his [[chariot]] to protect him from ''invidia''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 28.4.7 (28.39).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], whose primary source on Roman religion was the lost theological works of [[Marcus Terentius Varro]], notes that a phallic image was carried in procession annually at the festival of [[Liber|Father Liber]], the Roman god [[interpretatio graeca|identified with]] [[Dionysus|Dionysus or Bacchus]], for the purpose of protecting the fields from ''fascinatio'', magic compulsion:&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine of Hippo]], ''[[City of God (book)|De civitate Dei]]'' 7.21; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Varro says that certain rites of Liber were celebrated in Italy which were of such unrestrained wickedness that the shameful parts of the male were worshipped at crossroads in his honour. … For, during the days of the [[Liberalia|festival of Liber]], this obscene member, placed on a little trolley, was first exhibited with great honour at the crossroads in the countryside, and then conveyed into the city itself. … In this way, it seems, the god Liber was to be propitiated, in order to secure the growth of seeds and to repel enchantment ''(fascinatio)'' from the fields.&lt;ref&gt;English translation by R.W. Dyson, ''Augustine: The City of God against the Pagans'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998, 2002), p. 292 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ReU2M8cLtGcC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=%2221+Of+the+wickedness+of+the+rites+celebrated+in+honour+of+Liber%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%2221%20Of%20the%20wickedness%20of%20the%20rites%20celebrated%20in%20honour%20of%20Liber%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As a divinized phallus, Fascinus shared attributes with [[Mutunus Tutunus]], whose shrine was supposed to date from the [[Founding of Rome|founding of the city]], and the imported Greek god [[Priapus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnobius]], ''Adversus nationes'' 4.7, explicitly connects Tutunus to the ''fascinus''; see [[Robert E.A. Palmer]], "Mutinus Titinus: A Study in Etrusco-Roman Religion and Topography," in ''Roman Religion and Roman Empire: Five Essays'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1974), pp. 187–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a magic symbol==
Phallic charms, often winged, were ubiquitous in Roman culture, appearing as objects of jewellery such as pendants and finger rings, relief carvings, lamps, and wind chimes (''[[Tintinnabulum|tintinnabula]]'').&lt;ref name='CAW'&gt;{{cite book |author1=Williams, C.

There are very few Roman images of people wearing a phallic charm.&lt;ref name='Dasen' /&gt; Varro notes the custom of hanging a phallic charm on a baby's neck,{{efn|Varro, ''On the Latin language'', VII.97}} and examples have been found of phallus-bearing rings too small to be worn except by children.&lt;ref name='Henig'&gt;Martin Henig, ''Religion in Roman Britain'' (London: BT Batsford LTD, 1984), pp. 185–186 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOhxSp8nlPsC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=%22A+child's+gold+ring+with+phallus%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1tOTTIXKG4TfnAenpYCRCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20child's%20gold%20ring%20with%20phallus%22&amp;f=false online], with image of example.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 [[experimental archaeology]] project suggested that some types of phallic pendant were designed to remain pointing outwards, in the direction of travel of the wearer, in order to face towards any potential danger or bad luck and nullify it before it could affect the wearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Whitmore, A. |date=2017 |chapter=Fascinating ''fascina'': apotropaic magic and how to wear a penis |editor1=Cifarelli, M. |editor2=Gawlinkski, L. |title=What shall I say of clothes?

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman mythology|myth]], '''Faunus''' {{IPA-la|ˈfau̯nʊs|}} was the rustic god of the forest, plains and fields; when he made cattle fertile he was called [[Inuus]]. He came to be equated in literature with the Greek god [[Pan (god)|Pan]], after which Romans depicted him as a [[horned deity|horned god]].

Faunus was one of the oldest Roman deities, known as the ''[[di indigetes]]''. According to the epic poet [[Virgil]], he was a legendary king of the Latins. His shade was consulted as a goddess of prophecy under the name of Fatuus, with oracles&lt;ref&gt;For descriptions of Faunus as an oracular deity, see:&lt;br/&gt; {{cite book |author=[[Virgil]] |title=[[Aeneid]] |at=vii.81}}&lt;br/&gt; {{cite book |author=[[Ovid]] |title=[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]] |at=iv.649}}&lt;br/&gt; {{cite book |author=[[Cicero]] |title=[[De Natura Deorum]] |at=ii.6, iii.15}}&lt;br/&gt; {{cite book |author=[[Cicero]] |title=[[De Divinatione]] |at=i.101}}&lt;br/&gt; {{cite book |author=[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] |title={{math|Ῥωμαϊκὴ Ἀρχαιολογία}} |lang=el |trans-title=Roman Antiquities |at=v.16}}&lt;br/&gt; {{cite book |author=[[Plutarch]] |title=Numa Pompilius |at=xv.3}}&lt;br/&gt; {{cite book |author=[[Lactantius]] |title=Institutiones |at=i.22.9}}&lt;br/&gt; {{cite book |author=[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] |title=On the Aeneid |at=viii.314}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[sacred grove]] of [[Tibur]], around the well [[Albunea]], and on the [[Aventine Hill]] in [[ancient Rome]] itself.&lt;ref name=Peck-1898&gt;Peck 1898&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation|date=October 2022|reason=no such article in bibliography}}

[[William Warde Fowler|Fowler]] (1899) suggested that ''Faunus'' is identical with [[Anemoi#West wind|''Favonius'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fowler, W.W. |author-link=William Warde Fowler |year=1899 |title=The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic: An introduction to the study of the religion of the Romans |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |place=London, UK |page=[https://archive.org/details/romanfestivalsof00fowluoft/page/259 259] |url=https://archive.org/details/romanfestivalsof00fowluoft |access-date=2007-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source needed|date=April 2020}} one of the Roman [[wind gods]] (compare the [[Anemoi]]).

==Etymology==
The name ''Faunus'' is generally thought to stem from [[Proto-Italic language|Proto-Italic]] *''fawe'' or ''*fawono'' (variant *''fawōn(jo)''), thus being [[cognate]] with [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]] ''fons'', ''foner'' ('merciful'). It may ultimately derive from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) ''*bʰh₂u-n'' ('favourable'), which also reflects [[Old Irish]] ''búan'' ('good, favourable, firm') and [[Middle Welsh]] ''bun'' ('maiden, sweetheart').{{Sfn|de Vaan|2008|p=|pp=205–206}}&lt;ref name=NečasHraste-Vuković-2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nečas Hraste |first1=Daniel |last2=Vuković |first2=Krešimir |year=2011 |title=Rudra-Shiva and Silvanus-Faunus: Savage and propitious |journal=Journal of Indo-European Studies |volume=39 |issue=1–2 |pages=100–115 |issn=0092-2323}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 102}}

Another theory contends that Faunus is the Latin outcome of PIE *''dhau-no-'' ('the strangler', thus denoting the 'wolf'), a proposition suggested by the fact that the two [[Lupercalia|Luperci]] ("wolf-men", from Latin ''lupus'', 'wolf') are commonly treated as temporary priests of the god Faunus.{{Sfn|Briquel|1974|p=31}}{{Sfn|Sergent|1991|p=18|ps=: "...&amp;nbsp;le terme le plus proche est latin Faunus, qui, lié aux Luperci, doit être le loup"}}

== Origin ==
Faunus may be of [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] origin and related to the Vedic god [[Rudra]].&lt;ref name=NečasHraste-Vuković-2011/&gt; It is believed that he was worshipped by traditional Roman farmers before becoming a nature deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Faunus (ancient Italian god) |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica |lang=en |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Faunus |access-date=2020-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consorts and family==
[[File:Faunus Faunus (titel op object) Liber Chronicarum (serietitel), RP-P-2016-49-15-8.jpg|thumb|Faunus depicted as King of Latium ([[Nuremberg Chronicle]], 1493)]]
[[File:FaunusStatue.JPG|alt=|thumb|266x266px|Image of Faunus taken at the Fountain of Neptune in Florence, Italy. Sculpture by Bartolomeo Ammanati.]]
In fable Faunus appears as an old king of Latium, grandson of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturnus]], son of [[Picus]], and father of [[Latinus]] by the nymph [[Marica (mythology)|Marica]] (who was also sometimes Faunus' mother). After his death he is raised to the position of a tutelary deity of the land, for his many services to agriculture and cattle-breeding.

A goddess of like attributes, called '''[[Fauna (goddess)|Fauna]]''' and '''Fatua''', was associated in his worship. She was regarded as his daughter, wife, or sister.&lt;ref name=Peck-1898/&gt; The female deity [[Bona Dea]] was often equated with Fauna.

As Pan was accompanied by the ''Paniskoi'', or little Pans, so the existence of many [[Faun]]i was assumed besides the chief Faunus.&lt;ref name=Peck-1898/&gt; [[Faun]]s are place-spirits (''genii'') of untamed woodland. Educated, Hellenizing Romans connected their fauns with the Greek [[satyr]]s, who were wild and orgiastic drunken followers of [[Dionysus]], with a distinct origin.

== Conflation with Greek Pan ==
Faunus was naturally conflated with the [[Pan (god)|Greek god Pan]], who was a pastoral god of shepherds who was said to reside in [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]]. 
With the increasing influence of Greek mythology on Roman mythology in the 3rd and 2nd&amp;nbsp;centuries&amp;nbsp;{{sc|BCE}}, the Romans identified their own deities with Greek ones in what was called ''[[interpretatio Romana]]''.
However, the two deities were also considered separate by many; for instance, the epic poet [[Virgil]], in his ''[[Aeneid]]'', independently mentioned both Faunus and Pan.

Pan had always been [[horned deity|depicted with horns]] whereas the original Roman Faunus was not. An indication of the cultural conflation of the two can be seen in many Roman depictions of Faunus that also began to display Faunus with horns.

==Festivals==
In [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]'s epitome, Faunus is identified with ''Lupercus'' ("he who wards off the wolf"), otherwise a priest of Faunus. [[Livy]] named Inuus as the god originally worshiped at the [[Lupercalia]], 15&amp;nbsp;February, when his priests (''Luperci'') wore goat-skins and hit passers-by with goatskin whips.

Two festivals, called '''Faunalia''', were celebrated in his honour—one on 13&amp;nbsp;February, in the temple of Faunus on the [[Tiber Island|island in the Tiber]], the other on 5&amp;nbsp;December, when the peasants brought him rustic offerings and amused themselves with dancing.&lt;ref name=Peck-1898/&gt;

A [[euhemerism|euhemeristic]] account made Faunus a [[Latium|Latin]] king, son of [[Picus]] and [[Canens (mythology)|Canens]]. He was then revered as the god [[Fatuus]] after his death, worshipped in a sacred forest outside what is now [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]], but had been known since Etruscan times as Tibur, the seat of the [[Tiburtine Sibyl]]. His [[Numen|numinous presence]] was recognized by wolf skins, with wreaths and goblets.

In [[Nonnus|Nonnos]]' ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', Faunus/Phaunos accompanied Dionysus when the god campaigned in India.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Later worship==
Faunus was worshipped across the [[Roman Empire]] for many centuries. An example of this was a set of thirty-two 4th&amp;nbsp;century spoons found near [[Thetford]] in England in 1979. They had been engraved with the name "Faunus", and each had a different epithet after the god's name. The spoons also bore Christian symbols, and it has been suggested that these were initially Christian but later taken and devoted to Faunus by pagans. The 4th&amp;nbsp;century was a time of large scale [[Christianisation]], and the discovery provides evidence that even during the decline of [[Religion in ancient Rome|traditional Roman religion]], the god Faunus was still worshipped.&lt;ref name=Hutton-1991&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Ronald Hutton |author=Hutton, R. |year=1991 |title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=0-631-17288-2 |pages=260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Watts-1988-03&gt;{{cite journal |author=Watts, Dorothy J. |date=March 1988 |title=The Thetford treasure: A reappraisal |journal=Antiquaries Journal |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=55–68 |doi=10.1017/S0003581500022484 |s2cid=163068059 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquaries-journal/article/abs/thetford-treasure-a-reappraisal1/A41EB54BF141FD25C91A3D65D4A33F6F |access-date=2022-10-21 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aius Locutius''' ({{lang-lat|āius locūtius}}, spoken affirmation) or '''Aius Loquens''' ({{lang-lat|āius loquens}}, speaking affirmation), was a [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[List of Roman deities|deity]] or [[numen]] associated with the [[Battle of the Allia|Gallic invasions]] of Rome during the early 4th century BC.

According to [[Roman mythology|legend]], a Roman [[plebs|plebeian]] named M. Caedicius heard a supernatural, nocturnal voice that issued from [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta's]] sacred grove,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Turfa |first=Jean MacIntosh |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5g3h5G16EkC&amp;newbks=0&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq&amp;hl=en |title=The Etruscan World |date=2014-11-13 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-05530-2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the base of the [[Palatine hill]]. It warned him of an imminent Gaulish attack, recommended that the walls of Rome be fortified and instructed him to pass these messages on to the [[tribune of the plebs]], but because of the messenger's humble station, the message was ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Driediger-Murphy |first=Lindsay Gayle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zx6yDwAAQBAJ&amp;newbks=0&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq&amp;hl=en |title=Ancient Divination and Experience |last2=Eidinow |first2=Esther |date=2019 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-884454-9 |pages=90 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence, the Gauls entered and burned the city (c. 390&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Francesca |first=Vio, Rohr |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUhkEAAAQBAJ&amp;newbks=0&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq&amp;hl=en |title=Powerful Matrons: New political actors in the Late Roman Republic |date=2022 |publisher=Prensas de la Universidad de Zaragoza |isbn=978-84-1340-452-3 |pages=47 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the Gauls were repelled, the Senate built a temple and altar (known as ''Ara Aius Locutius'' or ''Ara Saepta'') to propitiate the unknown deity who had offered the warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=William|title=A Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology and Geography|date=1904|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYQcdGKV9psC&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Platner |first=Samuel Ball |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SYqFBwAAQBAJ&amp;newbks=0&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq&amp;hl=en |title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome |date=2015-05-21 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-08324-9 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was said to have been set up where Caedicius had heard the divine voice.

In the broad context of official [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], Aius Locutius is exceptional. Officially, the gods might speak through the cryptic writings and utterances of specialised [[oracles]], or through a complex system of signs in answer to the specific questions of State [[augurs]]. They might also grant signs of fortune to their most favoured protégés, or speak privately to them in dreams. Aius Locutius gave clear, urgent instructions of great importance to the State, in a voice "clearer than human", but in everyday Latin, to an ordinary plebeian passer-by. Thereafter, according to [[Cicero]], "having acquired a temple, an altar, and a name, 'Speaker' never spoke again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ando|first1=Clifford|title=The Matter of the Gods: Religion and the Roman Empire|date=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vmQkvj9qdXkC&amp;dq=locutius&amp;pg=PA125|isbn=9780520250833}} Author's paraphrasis of Cicero, ''De divinatione'', 2.69.&lt;/ref&gt; As a trained augur, Cicero was obliged to successfully identify and expiate any prodigies, including such "divine noise" that might signal imminent disaster or divine discontent. Beard (2012) places Aius Locutius at the "extraordinary limit" of such sounds, for the unequivocal clarity of the warning, and the consequences of its rejection by Roman authorities; a god "defined by his voice alone".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], "Cicero's 'Response of the haruspices' and the Voice of the Gods", pp. 28-29 in ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 102 (2012), pp. 20-39, Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, available at [[JSTOR]] [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41724964] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman mythology|mythology]], '''Liber''' ({{IPAc-en|'|l|ai|b|@r}} {{respell|LY|bər}}, {{IPA-la|ˈliːbɛr|lang}}; "the free one"), also known as '''Liber Pater''' ("the free Father"), was a god of  [[viticulture]] and wine, male fertility and freedom. He was a patron deity of Rome's [[Plebeians|plebeians]] and was part of their [[Aventine Triad]]. His festival of [[Liberalia]] (March 17) became associated with free speech and the rights attached to coming of age. His cult and functions were increasingly associated with Romanised forms of the Greek [[Dionysus]]/Bacchus, whose mythology he came to share.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Pierre, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iOx6de8LUNAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Dictionary of Classical Mythology''], Wiley-Blackwell, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-631-20102-1}}.[https://books.google.com/books?id=iOx6de8LUNAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA259#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name ''Līber'' ('free') stems from [[Proto-Italic language|Proto-Italic]] ''*leuþero'', and ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*h₁leudʰero'' ('belonging to the people', hence 'free').{{Sfn|de Vaan|2008|p=338}}

==Origins and establishment==
Before his official adoption as a Roman deity, Liber was companion to two different goddesses in two separate, archaic Italian fertility cults; [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], an agricultural and fertility goddess of Rome's Hellenised neighbours, and [[Libera (mythology)|Libera]], who was Liber's female equivalent. In ancient [[Lavinium]], he was a phallic deity. Latin ''liber'' means "free", or the "free one"; when coupled with "pater", it means "The Free Father", who personifies freedom and champions its attendant rights, as opposed to dependent servitude. The word 'liber' is also understood in regard of the concept libation, ritual offering of drink, which in Greek relates to 'spondé', literally related to English 'to spend'.  Roman writers of the late Republic and early Empire offer various etymological and poetic speculations based on this trope, to explain certain features of Liber's cult.&lt;ref name="google1996"&gt;[[Barbette Spaeth|Barbette Stanley Spaeth]], ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=5g3YDlPvbeMC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;vq=lavinium&amp;dq=%20Spaeth%2C%20Barbette%20S.%2C%20&amp;pg=PA142#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 8], [https://books.google.com/books?id=5g3YDlPvbeMC&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;vq=Liber%20Cicero&amp;dq=%20Spaeth%2C%20Barbette%20S.%2C%20&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 44.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.M.C. Green, "Varro's Three Theologies and their influence on the Fasti", in Geraldine Herbert-Brown, (ed)., ''Ovid's Fasti: historical readings at its bimillennium'', Oxford University Press, 2002. pp. 78-80.[https://books.google.com/books?id=CeFErNPdXOMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=jKfOltwDm_&amp;dq=Ovid's%20Fasti%3A%20historical%20readings%20at%20its%20bimillennium%20%20By%20Geraldine%20Herbert-Brown&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Liber entered Rome's historical tradition soon after the overthrow of the Roman monarchy, the establishment of the Republic and the first of many threatened or actual [[Secessio plebis|plebeian secessions]] from Rome's patrician authority. According to [[Livy]], the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis|A. Postumius]] vowed games ''([[ludi]])'' and a joint public [[Roman temple|temple]] to a [[Aventine Triad|Triad of Ceres, Liber and Libera]] on Rome's [[Aventine Hill]], c.496 BC.&lt;ref&gt;The vow was made in hope of victory against the Latins, the relief of a famine in Rome and the co-operation of Rome's plebeian soldiery in the coming war despite the threat of their secession.&lt;/ref&gt; In 493 the vow was fulfilled: the new Aventine temple was dedicated and ''[[Ludi|ludi scaenici]]'' ([[Theatre of ancient Rome|religious dramas]]) were held in honour of Liber, for the benefit of the [[SPQR|Roman people]]. These early ''ludi scaenici'' have been suggested as the earliest of their kind in Rome, and may represent the earliest official festival to Liber, or an early form of his [[Liberalia]] festival.&lt;ref name="autogenerated133"&gt;[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: a Roman myth'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, p.133.&lt;/ref&gt; The formal, official development of the Aventine Triad may have encouraged the assimilation of its individual deities to Greek equivalents: Ceres to [[Demeter]], Liber to [[Dionysus]] and Libera to [[Persephone]] or Kore.&lt;ref name="google1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.P. Wiseman, ''Remus: a Roman myth'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, p.133 and note 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liber's patronage of Rome's largest, least powerful class of citizens (the [[plebs|plebs, or plebeian commoners]]) associates him with particular forms of plebeian disobedience to the civil and religious authority claimed by Rome's Republican [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] elite. The Aventine Triad has been described as parallel to the [[Capitoline Triad]] of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and [[Quirinus]] on the Capitoline Hill, within the city's sacred boundary ([[pomerium]]): and as its "copy and antithesis".&lt;ref&gt;Barbette Stanley Spaeth, ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp. 6-8, 92, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5g3YDlPvbeMC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;vq=lavinium&amp;dq=%20Spaeth%2C%20Barbette%20S.%2C%20&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Spaeth cites Henri Le Bonniec, ''Le culte de Cérès à Rome. Des origines à la fin de la République,'' Paris, Librairie C. Klincksieck, 1958, for the Aventine cult with its central female deity as "copy and antithesis" of the early, entirely male Capitoline Triad. When Mars and Quirinus were later replaced by two goddesses, Jupiter remained the primary focus of Capitoline cult.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aventine Triad was apparently installed at the behest of the [[Sibylline Books]] but Liber's position within it seems equivocal from the outset. He was a god of the grape and of wine; his early ''ludi scaenici'' virtually defined their genre thereafter as satirical, subversive theatre in a lawful religious context. Some aspects of his cults remained potentially [[mos maiorum|un-Roman]] and offered a focus for civil disobedience. Liber asserted plebeian rights to ecstatic release, self-expression and free speech; he was ''Liber Pater'', the Free Father &amp;ndash; a divine personification of liberty, father of [[Marsyas#Prophecy and free speech at Rome|plebeian wisdoms and plebeian augury]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbette Stanley Spaeth, ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp. 6-8, 92, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5g3YDlPvbeMC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;vq=lavinium&amp;dq=%20Spaeth%2C%20Barbette%20S.%2C%20&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] While the Aventine temple and ludi may represent a patrician attempt to reconcile or at least molify the plebs, plebeian opposition to patrician domination continued throughout contemporary and later Republican history.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liber, Bacchus and Dionysus===
Liber's associations with wine, inebriation, uninhibited freedom and the subversion of the powerful made him a close equivalent to the Greek god [[Dionysus]], who was Romanised as [[Bacchus]].  In Graeco-Roman culture, Dionysus was [[euhemerism|euhemerised]] as a historical figure, a heroic saviour, world-traveller and founder of cities; and conqueror of India, whence he had returned in the first ever [[Roman triumph|triumph]], drawn in a golden chariot by tigers, accompanied by a retinue of drunken [[satyrs]] and [[maenad]]s. In some cults, and probably in the popular imagination, Liber was gradually assimilated to Bacchus and came to share his Romanised  "Dionysian" iconography and myths. Pliny calls him "the first to establish the practice of buying and selling; he also invented the diadem, the emblem of royalty, and the triumphal procession."&lt;ref&gt;See Pliny, ''Historia Naturalis'', 7.57 (ed. Bostock) at Perseus: [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137&amp;layout=&amp;loc=7.57 Tufts.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Roman mosaics and sarcophagi attest to various representations of this exotic triumphal procession. In Roman and Greek literary sources from the late Republic and Imperial era, several notable triumphs feature similar, distinctively "Bacchic" processional elements, recalling the supposedly historic "Triumph of Liber".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Beard, Mary]]: ''The Roman Triumph'', The Belknap Press of [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, Mass., and London, England, 2007, pp. 315 - 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liber and the Bacchanalia of 186 BC===
Very little is known of Liber's official and unofficial cults during the early to middle Republican era. Their Dionysiac or Bacchic elements seem to have been regarded as tolerably ancient, home-grown and manageable by Roman authorities until 186 BC, shortly after the end of the [[Second Punic War]]. Livy, writing 200 years after the event, gives a highly theatrical account of the [[Bacchanalia]]'s introduction by a foreign soothsayer, a "Greek of mean condition... a low operator of sacrifices". The cult spreads in secret, "like a plague". The lower classes, plebeians, women, the young, morally weak and effeminate males ("men most like women") are particularly susceptible: all such persons have ''leuitas animi'' (fickle or uneducated minds) but even Rome's elite are not immune. The Bacchanalia's priestesses urge their deluded flock to break all social and sexual boundaries, even to visit ritual murder on those who oppose them or betray their secrets: but a loyal servant reveals all to a shocked senate, whose quick thinking, wise actions and piety save Rome from the divine wrath and disaster it would otherwise have suffered.&lt;ref&gt;Sarolta Takacs, ''Vestal Virgins, Sibyls, and Matrons: Women in Roman Religion'',  University of Texas Press,  2008, p.95.

See Robert Rouselle, Liber-Dionysus in Early Roman Drama, ''The Classical Journal'', 82, 3 (1987), p. 191.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3297899]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bacchanalia cults may have offered challenge to Rome's [[Mos maiorum|traditional, official values and morality]] but they were practiced in Roman Italy as Dionysiac cults for several decades before their alleged disclosure, and were probably no more secretive than any other mystery cult. Nevertheless, their presence at the Aventine provoked an investigation. The consequent legislation against them &amp;ndash; the ''[[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]]'' of 186 BC &amp;ndash; was framed as if in response to a dire and unexpected national and religious emergency, and its execution was unprecedented in thoroughness, breadth and ferocity. Modern scholarship interprets this reaction as the senate's assertion of its own civil and religious authority throughout the Italian peninsula, following the recent [[Second Punic War|Punic War]] and subsequent social and political instability.&lt;ref&gt;During the Punic crisis, some foreign cults and oracles had been repressed, on much smaller scale and not outside Rome itself. See Erich S. Gruen, ''Studies in Greek culture and Roman policy'', BRILL, 1990, pp.34-78: on precedents see p.41 ff.[https://books.google.com/books?id=dnOPjX6GOrgC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;ots=cvlbAQq3cx&amp;dq=Gruen%201990%20Bacchus&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The cult was officially represented as the workings of a secret, illicit state within the Roman state, a conspiracy of priestesses and misfits, capable of anything. Bacchus himself was not the problem; like any deity, he had a right to cult. Rather than risk his divine offense, the Bacchanalia were not banned outright. They were made to submit to official regulation, under threat of ferocious penalties: some 6,000 persons are thought to have been put to death. The reformed Bacchic cults bore little resemblance to the crowded, ecstatic and uninhibited Bacchanalia: every cult meeting was restricted to five initiates and each could be held only with a praetor's consent. Similar attrition may have been imposed on Liber's cults; attempts to sever him from perceived or actual associations with the Bacchanalia seems clear from the official transference of the Liberalia ''ludi'' of 17 March to Ceres' [[Cerealia]] of 12–19 April. Once the ferocity of official clampdown eased off, the Liberalia games were officially restored, though probably in modified form.&lt;ref name="autogenerated133"/&gt; Illicit Bacchanals persisted covertly for many years, particularly in Southern Italy, their likely place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;See Sarolta A. Takács, Politics and Religion in the Bacchanalian Affair of 186 B.C.E., ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology,'' Vol. 100, (2000), p.301. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3185221]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard, M.,  Price, S.,  North, J.,  ''Religions of Rome: Volume 1, a History'', illustrated, Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 93 - 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals, cults and priesthoods==
Liber was closely, often interchangeably identified with Bacchus, Dionysus and their mythology but was not entirely subsumed by them; in the late Republican era, Cicero could insist on the "non-identity of Liber and Dionysus" and describe Liber and Libera as children of Ceres. Liber, like his Aventine companions, carried elements of his older cults into official Roman religion. He protected various aspects of agriculture and fertility, including the vine and the "soft seed" of its grapes, wine and wine vessels, and male fertility and virility.&lt;ref&gt;Libera protected female fertility.&lt;/ref&gt; As his divine power was incarnate in the vine, grape and wine,&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', 2.6O. See also St Augustine, ''De Civitatis Dei'', 4.11.&lt;/ref&gt; he was offered the first, sacred [[pressing (wine)|pressing]] of the grape-[[harvest (wine)|harvest]], known as ''sacrima''.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth find a parallel in the offer of first harvest grains to Ceres. See Barbette Stanley Spaeth, ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp.41, 43. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5g3YDlPvbeMC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;vq=lavinium&amp;dq=%20Spaeth%2C%20Barbette%20S.%2C%20&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q=Liber%20&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wine produced under Liber's patronage was his gift to humankind, and therefore fit for [[Profanum|profane]] (non-religious) use: it could be mixed with old wine for the purposes of fermentation, and otherwise adulterated and diluted according to taste and circumstance. For religious purposes, it was ritually "impure" (''vinum spurcum''). Roman religious law required that the libations offered to the gods in their official cults should be ''vinum inferum'', a strong wine of pure vintage, also known as ''temetum''&lt;!-- We need an article on Roman viniculture, its terminology and wine-etiquette --&gt;. It was made from the best of the crop, selected and pressed under the patronage of Rome's sovereign deity [[Jupiter (mythology)#Viniculture and wine|Jupiter]] and ritually purified by his ''[[Flamen Dialis|flamen]]'' (senior priest).  Liber's role in viniculture and wine-making was thus both complementary and subservient to Jupiter's.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier de Cazanove, "Jupiter, Liber et le vin latin", ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'', 1988, Vol. 205, Issue 205-3, pp. 245-265 [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rhr_0035-1423_1988_num_205_3_1888]&lt;/ref&gt;

Liber also personified male procreative power, which was ejaculated as the "soft seed" of human and animal semen. His temples held the [[Fascinus|image of a phallus]]; in Lavinium, this was the principal focus for his month-long festival, when according to St. Augustine, the "dishonourable member" was placed "on a little trolley" and taken in procession around the local [[Lares#Lares and the Compitalia|crossroad shrines]], then to the local forum for its crowning by an honourable matron. The rites ensured the growth of seeds and repelled any malicious enchantment (''fascinatus'') from fields.&lt;ref&gt;St Augustine, (trans. R. W. Dyson) ''The City of God against the pagans'', 7.21., in Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought, 1998, pp. 292-3. St Augustine (AD 354 – 430) uses Varro (116 – 27 BC) as source.[https://books.google.com/books?id=ReU2M8cLtGcC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=%2221+Of+the+wickedness+of+the+rites+celebrated+in+honour+of+Liber%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Liber&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Liber's festivals are timed to the springtime awakening and renewal of fertility in the agricultural cycle. In Rome, his annual [[Liberalia]] public festival was held on March 17. A portable shrine was carried through Rome's neighbourhoods (''[[Vicus|vici]]''); Liber's aged, ivy-crowned priestesses ([[Sacerdos Liberi]]) offered honey cakes for sale, and offered sacrifice on behalf of those who bought them &amp;ndash; the discovery of honey was credited to Liber-Bacchus. Embedded within Liberalia, more or less at a ritualistic level, were the various freedoms and rights attached to Roman ideas of virility as a divine and natural force.&lt;ref name="google1996"/&gt; Young men celebrated their coming of age; they cut off and dedicated their first beards to their household [[Lares]] and if citizens, wore their first ''[[toga]] virilis'', the "manly" toga &amp;ndash; which [[Ovid]], perhaps by way of poetic etymology, calls a ''toga libera'' (Liber's toga or "toga of freedom"). These new citizens registered their citizenship at the forum and were then free to vote, to leave their father's ''domus'' (household), choose a marriage partner and, thanks to Liber's endowment of virility, father their own children. Ovid also emphasises the less formal freedoms and rights of Liberalia. From his later place of exile, where he was sent for an unnamed offense against Augustus having to do with free speech, Ovid lamented the lost companionship of his fellow poets, who apparently saw the Liberalia as an opportunity for uninhibited talking.&lt;ref&gt;See John F. Miller, "Ovid's Liberalia", in Geraldine Herbert-Brown,(ed)., ''Ovid's Fasti: historical readings at its bimillennium'', Oxford University Press, 2002, pp. 199-224. Briefer scholarly treatment of the Festival is offered in William Warde Fowler, ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'', Gorgias Press, 2004 (reprint of Macmillan and Co., London, 1908), pp.54 - 56.[https://books.google.com/books?id=_2w01mQEOBAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=aqOdEBwy3q&amp;dq=Warde%20Fowler%20Ovid%20Liberalia&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imperial era==
Augustus successfully courted the plebs, supported their patron deities and began the restoration of the Aventine Triad's temple; it was re-dedicated by his successor, [[Tiberius]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Annals, 2.49; Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 6.17.&lt;/ref&gt; Liber is found in some of the threefold, complementary deity-groupings of [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]]; a saviour figure, like [[Hercules]] and the Emperor himself.&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al''., Vol. 1, 134 - 5, 64 - 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The reign and dynasty of the emperor [[Septimius Severus]] were inaugurated with games to honour Liber/[[Shadrafa]] and Hercules/[[Melqart]], the Romanised founding hero-deities of his native town, [[Leptis Magna]] (North Africa). He built them a massive temple and arch in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, A., Cameron, A., Garnsey, P., (Eds) The Crisis of Empire, AD 193-337, The Cambridge Ancient History, 2nd edition, Volume 12, 2005, p.563.[https://books.google.com/books?id=MNSyT_PuYVMC&amp;pg=PA563&amp;lpg=PA563&amp;dq=Liber+Pater+Shadrapa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uJC6aYMgcZ&amp;sig=TPspaBnGr9ki5z7D5KeVe5QS4Nw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wkz1TLXKKMa1hAfGyM3aBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Liber%20Pater%20Shadrapa&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Later still, Liber Pater is of one of many deities served by the erudite, deeply religious senator [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus]] (c. AD 315 – 384).&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Matthews, Symmachus and the Oriental Cults, ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 63 (1973), p. 179. Praetextatus' erudition and religiosity are attested by his widow, herself a priestess. Praetextatus was also an [[augur]], ''[[Quindecimviri sacris faciundis|quindecimvir]]'' and public priest of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] and Sol, an initiate of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]], and priest of [[Hecate]], [[Sarapis]], [[Cybele]], and [[Mithras]], all apparently clustered on a solar theology analogous to that of the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A Bacchic community shrine dedicated to Liber Pater was established in [[Cosa]] (in modern Tuscany), probably during the 4th century AD. It remained in use "apparently for decades after the edicts of Theodosius in 391 and 392 AD outlawing paganism". Its abandonment, or perhaps its destruction "by zealous Christians", was so abrupt that much of its cult paraphernalia survived virtually intact beneath the building's later collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Jaquelyn Collins-Clinton, A late antique shrine of Liber Pater at Cosa, ''Etudes Preliminaires aux Religions Orientales dans l'Empire Romain, Volume 64,''  BRILL, 1977, pp.3, 5. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CsoUAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;ots=rM2A5Kjc7w&amp;dq=Liber%20Pater&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=paraphernalia&amp;f=false]
&lt;/ref&gt; Around the end of the 5th century, in [[Orosius]]'s ''Seven Books of History Against the Pagans'', Liber Pater's mythic conquest of India is taken as an historical event, which left a harmless, naturally peaceful nation "dripping with blood, full of corpses, and polluted with [Liber's] lusts."&lt;ref&gt;Paulus Orosius: Seven Books of History Against the Pagans, trans. and ed. A T Fear, Liverpool University Press, 2010, p. 57, and editor's footnote 179, concerning Orosius' use of "Pater" to emphasise "the cruelty of this pagan father as opposed to the mercy of the Christian God the Father."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temples and cult images==
Pliny the Elder describes the Aventine Triad's temple as designed by Greek architects, and typically Greek in style; no trace remains of it, and the historical and epigraphical record offers only sparse details to suggest its exact location, but Pliny's description may be further evidence of time-honoured and persistent plebeian cultural connections with Magna Graecia, well into the Imperial era. [[Vitruvius]] recommends that Liber's [[Aedes (Roman)|temples]] follow an [[Ionic order|Ionic]] Greek model, as a "just measure between the severe manner of the [[Doric order|Doric]] and the tenderness of the Corinthian," respectful of the deity's part-feminine characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rykwert, ''The Dancing Column: On Order in Architecture'', Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, 1996, p.237.[https://books.google.com/books?id=3IKoh75RI38C&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=Vitruvius++Ionic+Liber&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CyLc_RxSEq&amp;sig=lZ-ea4QcrgVgMagXbAUVECpMfTQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Nxr4TJuuJJmAhAeboazFDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Vitruvius%20%20Ionic%20Liber&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
Gods named Liber and Libera play a major role in the [[science fiction]]/[[time-travel novel]] ''[[Household Gods (novel)|Household Gods]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] and [[Judith Tarr]].

[[Image:Jupiter Tonans.jpg|thumb|''Jupiter Tonans'', possibly reflecting the [[cult image]] of the temple of Jupiter Tonans in Rome (Spanish Royal collection, [[Museo del Prado|Prado]])]]
'''{{lang|la|Jupiter Tonans}}''', or, in Latin spelling, '''{{lang|la|{{Smallcaps|ivppiter tonans}}}}''' ("Thundering Jove") was the aspect (''numen'') of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] venerated in the '''Temple of Jupiter Tonans''', which was vowed in 26 BCE by [[Augustus]] and dedicated in 22 BCE on the [[Capitoline Hill]]; the Emperor had narrowly escaped being struck by lightning during the campaign in [[Cantabria]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Vita Augusti'' 29.91, etc. See Samuel Ball Platner and Thomas Ashby, ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome,'' London: Oxford University Press, 1929, p. 305f.[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Aedes_Jovis_Tonantis.html (On-line text)].&lt;/ref&gt; An old temple in the [[Campus Martius]] had long been dedicated to Iuppiter Fulgens. The original [[cult image]] installed in the sanctuary by its founder was by [[Leochares]],&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Pliny's Natural History]], 39.79&lt;/ref&gt; a Greek sculptor of the 4th century BCE.

In the 1st century [[Vitruvius]] observed (''[[De architectura]]'' I.2.5) the propriety or [[decorum]] required for temples of Jupiter Tonans, that they be ''hypaethral'', open to the sky. The 1st century poet Lucan also mentions the Temple of Jupiter Tonans in Rome (''[[De Bello Civili]]'' II.34).

The sculpture at the [[Prado]] (''illustration'') is considered to be a late 1st century replacement commissioned by [[Domitian]]. The Baroque-era restoration of the arms has given [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] a baton-like scepter in his raised hand.

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Virtus''' ({{IPA-la|ˈwɪrt̪uːs̠}}) was the deity of bravery and military strength, the personification of the Roman virtue of [[virtus (virtue)|virtus]].  The [[Greek mythology|Greek]] equivalent deity was [[Arete (moral virtue)#Personification|Arete]].&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Rufus Fears]], "The Theology of Victory at Rome: Approaches and Problem," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.17.2 (1981), pp. 747–748, 776 (note 201).&lt;/ref&gt; The deity was identified with the Roman god [[Honos]] (personification of honour) and was often honoured together with him, such as in the [[Temple of Virtus and Honos]] at the [[Porta Capena]] in [[Rome]].

The deity was represented in a variety of ways, for example, on the coins of [[Tetricus I|Tetricus]], they could appear as a matron, an old man, or a young man, with a [[javelin]], battle helmet, or only clothed in a cape. Within the realm of funerary reliefs Virtus is never shown without a male companion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=L|title=MUSES as models: learning and the complicity of authority|year=2008|publisher=The University of Michigan|pages=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often their presence within this realm of art is to compliment and provide assistance to the protagonist of the relief during a scene of intense masculinity or bravery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=L|title=MUSES as models: learning and the complicity of authority|year=2008|publisher=The University of Michigan|pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
In the [[United States]] in 1776, Virtus was made the central figure in the [[Seal of Virginia]] and the subsequent [[Flag of Virginia|state flag]], which features the seal. The [[Virginia]] four-dollar note, a [[Continental (currency)|Continental currency]], had a similar Virtus pictured on its obverse.

[[Image:Roman sculpture.jpg|thumb|300px|Tiberinus (statue from the [[Capitoline Museum|Campidoglio, Rome]]).]]
'''Tiberinus''' is a figure in [[Roman mythology]]. He was the god of the [[Tiber|Tiber River]]. He was added to the 3,000 rivers (sons of [[Oceanus]] and [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]]), as the [[genius (mythology)|genius]] of the Tiber.

==Mythology==
According to Book VIII of [[Virgil]]'s epic ''[[Aeneid]]'', Tiberinus helped [[Aeneas]] after his arrival in Italy from [[Troy]], suggesting to him that he seek an alliance with [[Evander of Pallene]] in the war against [[Turnus]] and his allies (see [[founding of Rome]]). Tiberinus appeared to Aeneas in a dream, telling him he had arrived at his true home. Tiberinus also calmed the water so that Aeneas' boat was able to reach the city safely.&lt;ref&gt;Moroford, Mark and Lenardon, Robert ''Classical Mythology''&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Manto (mythology)|Manto]], Tiberinus was the father of [[Ocnus]].&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid,'' X, 198ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiberinus is also known as the river god who found the twins [[Romulus and Remus]] and gave them to the she-wolf [[Capitoline Wolf|Lupa]] (who had just lost her own cubs) to suckle. He later rescued and married [[Rhea Silvia]], the mother of the twins and a [[Vestal Virgin]] who had been sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Romulus_and_Remus/|title = Romulus and Remus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==
Tiberinus was considered to be one of the most important river-gods and people made sure to put offerings in the Tiber River every May. Tiberinus was honored with twenty-seven straw dummies which were called ''[[Argei]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Moroford, Mark and Lenardon, Robert ''Classical Mythology''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman mythology|ancient Roman myth]] and [[Latin literature|literature]], '''Mors'''  is the [[Death (personification)|personification of death]] equivalent to the Greek [[Thanatos|Thánatos]]. The [[Latin noun]] for "death", ''mors'', [[genitive]] ''mortis'', is of [[grammatical gender|feminine gender]], but surviving [[Roman art|ancient Roman art ]] is not known to depict Death as a woman.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Siegfried Guthke, ''The Gender of Death: A Cultural History in Art and Literature'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 24 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin poets, however, are bound by the grammatical gender of the word.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Burton, "The Gender of Death," in ''Personification in the Greek World'' (Ashgate, 2005), pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace]] writes of ''pallida Mors'', "pale Death," who kicks her way into the hovels of the poor and the towers of kings equally.&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]], ''Carmina'' 1.4.14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], for whom Mors is also pale, describes her "eager teeth."&lt;ref&gt;''Avidis … dentibus'':  [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Hercules Furens'' 555.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tibullus]] pictures Mors as black or dark.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tibullus]] 1.3.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mors is often represented [[allegory|allegorically]] in later Western literature and art, particularly during the [[Middle Ages]]. Depictions of the [[Crucifixion of Christ]] sometimes show Mors standing at the foot of the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Guthke, ''The Gender of Death'', pp. 24, 41, ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Mors' antithesis is personified as Vita, "Life."&lt;ref&gt;Guthke, ''The Gender of Death'', pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman mythology==
In Latin literature, Mors is sometimes identified with the Roman gods [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Remigius of Auxerre]], ''In Martianum'' 36.7: "Mars is called so as if ''mors'' (death)," as cited by Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433–1177'' (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 578, note 70. The etymology-by-association of Remigius should be distinguished from scientific linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; god of war; [[Dīs Pater]], god of the Roman underworld (later, also known as [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]) and [[Orcus]], god of death and punisher of perjurers. 

Mors is not immune to persuasion, resistance or trickery. In one story, [[Hercules]] fought Mors in order to save his friend's wife. In other stories, Mors serves Dis by ending the life of a person after the thread of his or her life has been cut by the [[Parcae]], and of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], messenger to the gods, escorting the dead person`s soul, or shade, down to the underworld's gate.{{cn|date=July 2022}}

'''Soranus''' was an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Falisci|Faliscan]], [[Capena|Capenate]] and [[Sabine]] god adopted into [[religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]]. He was worshipped on [[Mt. Soracte]] in [[Lazio]]. The area was sacred to underworld gods, such as [[Dis Pater]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]' commentary to [[Aeneid]], [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+A.+11.785&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053 XI. 785]&lt;/ref&gt;

The worshippers of Apollo Soranus, after his cult had been subsumed by [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]], were called ''Hirpi Sorani'' ("wolves of Soranus", from Sabine ''hirpus'' "wolf").

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''Mutunus Tutunus''' or '''Mutinus Titinus''' was a [[phallus|phallic]] marriage deity, in some respects equated with [[Priapus]]. His shrine was located on the [[Velian Hill]], supposedly since the [[founding of Rome]], until the 1st century BC.

During preliminary [[Marriage in ancient Rome|marriage rites]], Roman brides are supposed to have straddled the phallus of Mutunus to prepare themselves for intercourse, according to [[Church Fathers]] who interpreted this act as an obscene loss of [[virginity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[H.J. Rose]], ''The'' Roman Questions'' of Plutarch: A New Translation'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924, reprinted 1974), p. 84 [https://books.google.com/books?id=rKOuoVnZsFAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22Mutunus+Tutunus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=17#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mutunus%20Tutunus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian apologist [[Arnobius]] says that Roman matrons were taken for a ride (''inequitare'') on Tutunus's "awful phallus" with its "immense shameful parts",&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnobius]], ''Adversus nationes'' 4.7 (see also 4.11): ''Tutunus, cuius immanibus pudendis horrentique fascino vestras inequitare matronas et auspicabile ducitis et optatis''. Compare [[Tertullian]], ''Ad nationes'' 2.11 and ''Apologeticus'' 25.3. On the translation of ''pudendis'', see J.N. Adams, ''The Latin Sexual Vocabulary'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982, 1990), pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; but other sources specify that it is brides who learned through the ritual not to be embarrassed by sex: "Tutinus, upon whose shameful lap sit brides, so that the god seems to sample their shame before the fact."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lactantius]], ''Divinarum Institutionum'' 1.20.36: ''Tutinus in cuius sinu pudendo nubentes praesident ut illarum pudicitiam prior deus delibasse videatur''. See also [[Augustine of Hippo]] (particularly ''[[De civitate Dei]]'' 4.11 and 6.9) who "several times refers with distaste to the practices associated with" the priapic gods; R.W. Dyson, ''The City of God Against the Pagans'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998, 2002), p. 1221 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ReU2M8cLtGcC&amp;pg=PA1221&amp;dq=%22Mutunus+Tutunus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mutunus%20Tutunus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd-century grammarian [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] is the only classical Latin source to take note of the god,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Noël Robert]], ''Eros romano: sexo y moral en la Roma antigua'' (Editorial Complutense, 1999), p. 58 [https://books.google.com/books?id=1wS-vtfUdbUC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=%22este+fascinus+tiene+nombre+y+se+le+honra+como+a+un+dios+Mutunus+Tutunus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22este%20fascinus%20tiene%20nombre%20y%20se%20le%20honra%20como%20a%20un%20dios%20Mutunus%20Tutunus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the characterization of the rite by Christian sources is likely to be hostile or biased.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Syme]], ''The Augustan Aristocracy'' (Oxford University Press, 1989), p. 6, note 37, marks "the mockery of the Christian writers"; see also Augustine's "distaste" for the phallic gods noted above. W.H. Parker, ''Priapea: Poems for a Phallic God'' (Routledge, 1988), p. 135 [https://books.google.com/books?id=iZUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=%22Church+fathers%22+mutunus+OR+tutunus+OR+mutinus+OR+titinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Church%20fathers%22%20mutunus%20OR%20tutunus%20OR%20mutinus%20OR%20titinus&amp;f=false online], observes that the ritual of Mutunus was "condemned by early Church fathers"; Joseph Rykwert, ''The Idea of a Town: The Anthropology of Urban Form in Rome, Italy, and the Ancient World'' (MIT Press, 1988), p. 159 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jq78Ff2TYHAC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=%22Church+fathers%22+mutunus+OR+tutunus+OR+mutinus+OR+titinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Church%20fathers%22%20mutunus%20OR%20tutunus%20OR%20mutinus%20OR%20titinus&amp;f=false online], notes that they spoke "scathingly" of phallic rituals. Tertullian's bias in his assemblage of deities to deride (including Mutunus) pointed out by [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], John North ''et al.'', ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 359, note 1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xQd82l39KX4C&amp;pg=PA359&amp;dq=Christian+mutunus+OR+tutunus+OR+mutinus+OR+titinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=17#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20mutunus%20OR%20tutunus%20OR%20mutinus%20OR%20titinus&amp;f=false online.] The ''fascinum'' — identified by Arnobius with the phallus of Mutunus — "was used by Christian writers in their tirades against pagan customs," points out Enrique Montero Cartelle, ''El latín erótico: aspectos léxicos y literarios'' (University of Seville, 1991), p. 70 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vUfXS1qQg9MC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22Fascinum+fue+empleado+por+los+escritores+cristianos%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fascinum%20fue%20empleado%20por%20los%20escritores%20cristianos%22&amp;f=false online.] For a fuller discussion, see Carlos A. Contreras, "Christian Views of Paganism," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.23.1 (1980) 974–1022, p. 1013 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0soI8HZXT3gC&amp;pg=PA1013&amp;dq=Christian+mutunus+OR+tutunus+OR+mutinus+OR+titinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=40#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20mutunus%20OR%20tutunus%20OR%20mutinus%20OR%20titinus&amp;f=false online] specifically in relation to Mutunus and in general asserting that "Arnobius commits the same mistake as other Fathers of applying Christian conceptions to pagan ideas in order to condemn them" (p. 1010). "Our knowledge of such things," that is, of rites such as those of Mutunus, "comes from Christian writers who are openly concerned to discredit all aspects of pagan idolatry," states Peter Stewart, ''Statues in Roman Society: Representation and Response'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 266, note 24 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xauWDEbWMs8C&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=%22Our+knowledge+of+such+things+comes+from+Christian+writers+who+are+openly%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Our%20knowledge%20of%20such%20things%20comes%20from%20Christian%20writers%20who%20are%20openly%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Unlike Priapus, who is depicted in human form with an outsized [[erection]], Mutunus seems to have been embodied purely by the phallus, like the ''[[fascinus]]'' or the mysterious begetter of [[Servius Tullius]]. The god's name is related to two infrequently recorded slang words for penis in Latin, ''mūtō'' (or ''muttō'') and ''mūtōnium''.&lt;ref&gt;J.N. Adams, ''The Latin Sexual Vocabulary'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982, 1990), p. 62 [https://books.google.com/books?id=GDP9VHGbF1AC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=%22Mutunus+Tutunus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mutunus%20Tutunus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; "Mutto" was also used as a ''[[cognomen]]'', the third of the [[Roman naming convention|three elements of a Roman man's name]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' V.1412, 8473, as cited by Adams. The moneyer Quintus Titius, one of whose coins has been interpreted as depicting Mutunus, may have used the ''cognomen'' Mutto; [[T.R.S. Broughton]], ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic'' (American Philological Association, 1952), vol. 2, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaius Lucilius|Lucilius]] offers the earliest recorded instance of both forms: ''at laeva lacrimas muttoni&lt;ref&gt;''Muttōni'' is the [[dative case|dative]] form of ''muttō''.&lt;/ref&gt; absterget amica'' ("A girlfriend wipes away Mutto's tears — his left hand, that is"),&lt;ref&gt;Lucilius 307 and 959. Kirk Freundenburg has dubbed the ''muttō'' of Lucilius "clearly the least finicky of all personified penises in Roman satire": ''Satires of Rome: Threatening Poses from Lucilius to Juvenal'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 205 [https://books.google.com/books?id=QzOjItakZRoC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=muttonis&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=muttonis&amp;f=false  online.] The left hand was preferred for masturbation by the Romans; see Antonio Varone, ''Erotica pompeiana: Love Inscriptions on the Walls of Pompeii'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 2002), p. 95 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vg9h-tW4KikC&amp;dq=insula+felicula&amp;q=%22To+grasp+the+meaning+of+the+text%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22To%20grasp%20the%20meaning%20of%20the%20text%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the derivative ''mūtōnium''. ''Mūtōnium'' may have replaced the earlier form, as it appears later among the [[Graffito (archaeology)|graffiti of Pompeii]].&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' IV.1939, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace]] has a dialogue with his ''muttō'': "What do you want? Surely you're not demanding a grand [[Roman consul|consul]]'s granddaughter as a cunt?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]], ''[[Satires (Horace)|Sermones]]'' 1.2.68.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Lucilius and Horace thus personify the ''muttō''.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Latin Sexual Vocabulary'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mūtūniātus'', used by [[Martial]] and in the ''[[Priapeia|Corpus Priapeorum]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Martial]], ''Epigrams'' 3.73.1 and 11.63.2; [[Corpus Priapeorum]] 52.10.&lt;/ref&gt; describes a "well-endowed" male.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Arthur Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford University Press, 1990), p. 92 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Kf4cs5Y0fiIC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=%22Mutinus+Titinus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mutinus%20Titinus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both parts of the name ''Mūtūnus Tūtūnus'' are [[reduplicative]], ''Tītīnus'' perhaps from ''tītus'', another slang word for "penis."&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Latin Sexual Vocabulary'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible, if not probable, that Latin "mut" was a vowelized loan derivative of the consonantal Egyptian word MT for 'phallus, male, man' in the adjacent hieroglyph, considering that Egyptian scribes did not vowelize MT, and that Budge&lt;ref&gt;Budge, E.A. "An Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary", Vol. I, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; added an /e/ to MT in his dictionary to make it pronounceable.

==Cult==
The shrine of Mutunus Tutunus on the Velia has not been located. According to Festus, it was destroyed to make a private [[Roman bath|bath]] for the ''[[College of Pontiffs|pontifex]]'' and [[Augustus|Augustan]] supporter [[Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus|Domitius Calvinus]], even though it was revered as among the most ancient landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] 142L, as cited and discussed by Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 262 [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;dq=%22Mutinus+Titinus%22&amp;q=mutunus#v=snippet&amp;q=mutunus&amp;f=false online.] See also [[Ronald Syme]], ''The Augustan Aristocracy'' (Oxford University Press, 1989), p. 6 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fj8oQ4lzteIC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=%22Mutunus+Tutunus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=19#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mutunus%20Tutunus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This uprooting raises the question of why Calvinus was permitted to displace such a venerable shrine. The Church Fathers associate Mutunus with groupings of other deities that are assumed to be based on the lost theological works of [[Varro]]. Through examining these connections, [[R. E. A. Palmer|Robert Palmer]] concluded that the old cult of Mutunus was merged with that of [[Liber|Father Liber]], who was variously identified with or shared attributes with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Bacchus (mythology)|Bacchus]], and [[Priapus#Worship and attributes|Lampsacene Priapus]]. Palmer further conjectured that it was Mutunus, in the form of Liber, to whom [[Julius Caesar]] made sacrifice on the [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|day of his assassination]], receiving the ill [[omen]]s that the conspirator [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Brutus]] urged him to ignore. Caesar had previously celebrated his victory at the [[Battle of Munda]] on the [[Liberalia]], or festival of Liber held March 17, and he visited the house of the ''pontifex'' Calvinus on the [[Ides of March]], near the archaic shrine of Mutunus-Liber. In Palmer's view, the evident ill favor of the god gave [[Augustus]] license to reform the cult during his program of religious revivalism that often disguised radical innovations. The god was then [[Hellenized]] as [[Dionysus#Appellations|Bacchus Lyaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[R. E. A. Palmer|Robert E.A. Palmer]], "Mutinus Titinus: A Study in Etrusco-Roman Religion and Topography," in ''Roman Religion and Roman Empire: Five Essays'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1974), pp. 187–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer concurred with [[Numismatics|numismatists]] who regard a [[denarius]] minted by Quintus [[Titia gens|Titius]], [[moneyer]] ''ca.'' 90–88 BC, as picturing an aged and bearded Mutunus on its [[obverse and reverse|obverse]].&lt;ref&gt;The identification dates back at least to Ch. Lenormant, "Types des médailles romaines," ''Revue numismatique'' (1838), pp. 11–12 [https://books.google.com/books?id=dnjRAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Mutinus+Titinus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=17#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mutinus%20Titinus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The winged diadem is a reference to the Priapus of Lampsacus and to the winged phallus as a common motif in Roman decorative arts, which can also serve as an [[apotropaic]] charm against the [[evil eye]]. Another issue by Titius pictures an ivy-crowned Bacchus, with both denarii having a virtually identical [[Pegasus]] on the reverse. [[Michael Crawford (historian)|Michael Crawford]] finds "no good grounds" for identifying this figure as Mutunus,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Crawford (historian)|Michael Crawford]], ''Roman Republican Coinage'' (Cambridge University Press, 1974, 2001), vol. 1, pp. 344 and 346 [https://books.google.com/books?id=NuBION2KtM4C&amp;pg=PA346&amp;dq=%22Mutunus+Tutunus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=18#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mutunus%20Tutunus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; but Palmer points to the shared [[iconography]] of the Bacchus–Liber–Priapus figure and the associative [[etymology]] of the ''[[gens]]'' name Titius. A ''titus'' ("penis") with wings was a visual pun, since the word also referred to a type of bird.&lt;ref name=satire&gt;[[Scholiast]] on [[Persius]], ''Satire'' 1.20; Adams, ''Latin Sexual Vocabulary'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Varro seems to have associated ''Titinus'' with the [[Titii]], in an etymological collocation that included [[Titus Tatius]], the royal [[Sabine]] contemporary of [[Romulus]]; the [[Curia]] Titia; or the ''[[Tribal Assembly|tribus]]'' of the [[Tribe#Etymology|Titienses]], one of the three original tribes of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, "Mutinus Titinus," p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''Vagitanus''' or '''Vaticanus''' was one of a number of childbirth deities who influenced or guided some aspect of [[parturition]], in this instance the newborn's crying.&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), pp. 136–137 [https://books.google.com/books?id=o8IwHDOpeWYC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=Vagitanus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1972&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=14#v=onepage&amp;q=Vagitanus&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The name is related to the [[Latin]] [[noun]] ''vagitus'', "crying, squalling, wailing," particularly by a baby or an animal, and the [[verb]] ''vagio, vagire''.&lt;ref&gt;Emilio Lorìa, ''Salute e magia attraverso i secoli'' (Padua: Piccin Nuova, 1994), p. 41 [https://books.google.com/books?id=NDJzL1Z5vnkC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=Vagitanus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1972&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=52#v=onepage&amp;q=Vagitanus&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Vagitanus has thus been described as the god "who presided over the beginning of human speech,"&lt;ref&gt;George C. Simmons, ''Education and Western Civilization: Greece, Rome, and the Middle Ages'' (College Readings, 1972), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; but a distinction should be made between the first cry and the first instance of articulate speech, in regard to which [[Fabulinus]] (''fari'', "to speak"; cf. ''[[fable#Definitions|fabula]]'') was the deity to invoke.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Hinds, ''Life in the Roman Empire: Religion'' (Marshall Cavendish, 2005), p. 52 [https://books.google.com/books?id=feAe0fXXDhsC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=Fabulinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1932&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=17#v=onepage&amp;q=Fabulinus&amp;f=false  online]; Antonio Verone, ''Rediscovering Pompeii: Exhibition by IBM-ITALIA, New York City'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 1990), p. 135 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ciNtH6c9RDQC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=Fabulinus+%22names+reflect+their+specific+domains%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Fabulinus%20%22names%20reflect%20their%20specific%20domains%22&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Vagitanus has been connected to a remark by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] that only a human being is thrown naked onto the naked earth on his day of birth for immediate wails (''vagitus'') and weeping.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 7.1 (in [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plin.+Nat.+7.1&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137 English]): ''hominem tantum nudum et in nuda humo natali die abicit ad vagitus statim et ploratum''; see Morell's notes [https://books.google.com/books?id=dnNAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Deus+Vagitanus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=71#v=onepage&amp;q=Deus%20Vagitanus&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Background==
[[File:Human-Male-White-Newborn-Baby-Crying.jpg|thumb|In ancient Rome, '''Vagitanus''' or '''Vaticanus''' was invoked as the god who opened the newborn's mouth to wail; the first syllable of his name, pronounced ''wa'' in [[Classical Latin]], was thought to be [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]]]]
These "divine functionaries" ([[German language|German]] ''Sondergötter'') whose names express their sphere of influence are considered characteristic of [[Indo-European religion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gonda]], "Reflections on the Indo-European Medium II," in ''Selected Studies'' (Brill, 1975), vol. 1, p. 158 [https://books.google.com/books?id=r7G7Dg9mhN8C&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=Fabulinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1932&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=23#v=onepage&amp;q=Fabulinus&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Vaticanus'' in connection to ''vagitus'' is discussed by [[Aulus Gellius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]]. Gellius quotes [[Varro]], who is generally acknowledged also as Augustine's main source on ancient Roman theology:&lt;ref&gt;Varro's works "were the closest equivalent to an encyclopedia Augustine had": ''Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia'' (Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1999), p. 863 [https://books.google.com/books?id=GcVhAGpvTQ0C&amp;pg=PA863&amp;dq=Varro+Augustine's+source&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Varro%20Augustine's%20source&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have been told that the word ''Vatican'' is [[Vatican Hill|applied to the hill]], and the deity who presides over it, from the ''vaticinia'', or prophecies, which took place there by the power and inspiration of the god; but Marcus Varro, in his book on ''Divine Things'', gives another reason for this name. "As [[Aius]]," says he, "was called a deity, and an altar was built to his honour in the lowest part of the new road, because in that place a voice from heaven was heard, so this deity was called ''Vaticanus'', because he presided over the principles of the human voice; for infants, as soon as they are born, make the sound which forms the first syllable in ''Vaticanus'', and are therefore said ''vagire'' (to cry) which word expresses the noise which an infant first makes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]], ''Attic Nights'' 16.17: ''Et agrum Vaticanum et eiusdem agri deum praesidem appellatum acceperamus a vaticiniis, quae vi atque instinctu eius dei in eo agro fieri solita essent. Sed praeter hanc causam M. Varro in libris divinarum aliam esse tradit istius nominis rationem: "Nam sicut Aius" inquit "deus appellatus araque ei statuta est, quae est infima nova via, quod eo in loco divinitus vox edita erat, ita Vaticanus deus nominatus, penes quem essent vocis humanae initia, quoniam pueri, simul atque parti sunt, eam primam vocem edunt, quae prima in Vaticano syllabast idcircoque "vagire" dicitur exprimente verbo sonum vocis recentis''. English translation by William Beloe, ''The Attic Nights of Aulus Gellius'' (London, 1795), vol. 3, pp. 247–248 [https://books.google.com/books?id=5P8RAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=Vaticanus+OR+Vagitanus+intitle:Attic+intitle:Nights&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Vaticanus%20OR%20Vagitanus%20intitle%3AAttic%20intitle%3ANights&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the insistence on an etymological connection between the god's name and ''vagitus'', [[Jakob Gronovius|Gronovius]] thought the correct form should be ''Vaticanus'', and that ''Vagitanus'' was [[Vulgar Latin]] rather than [[classical Latin|classical]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jakob Gronovius]], note to [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Attic Nights'' 16.18, in ''Auli Gellii: Noctes Atticae'' (London, 1824), p. 1522 [https://books.google.com/books?id=RtoIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA62&amp;dq=Deus+Vagitanus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=126#v=onepage&amp;q=Deus%20Vagitanus&amp;f=false  online.] See also Nicola Corcia, "Dell' origine di Roma,"  ''Atti della Reale Accademia di Archeologia, Lettere e Belle Arti'' 9 (Naples, 1879), p. 148 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OqUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA148&amp;dq=Deus+Vagitanus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=54#v=onepage&amp;q=Deus%20Vagitanus&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] mentions Vagitanus/Vaticanus three times in Book 4 ''[[De Civitate Dei|On the City of God]]'' in deriding the "mob" of Roman gods (''turba deorum''). In demonstrating that the names of gods reveal their function, he points to Vaticanus, "who presides over the cries (''vagitibus'') of infants," noting elsewhere that among the many deities associated with childbirth, Vaticanus is the one who opens the mouth of the newborn in crying (''in vagitu'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine of Hippo]], ''[[De civitate Dei]]'' 4.8: ''Vaticanus, qui infantum vagitibus praesidet'' (4.8) and ''ipse in uagitu os aperiat et uocetur deus Vaticanus'' (4.11); mentioned again in passing at 4.21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elagabalus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|l|ə|ˈ|ɡ|æ|b|ə|l|ə|s}}), '''Aelagabalus''', '''Heliogabalus,''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|iː|l|i|ə|ˈ|ɡ|æ|b|ə|l|ə|s}}) or simply '''Elagabal''' ([[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]]: 𐡁𐡋‎𐡄𐡂‎𐡀𐡋 ''ʾĕlāhgabāl'' or 𐡁𐡋‎𐡄𐡀𐡂‎𐡀𐡋 ''ʾĕlāhaʾgabāl''; [[Arabic]]: إله الجبل ''Ilah al-Jabal'', "mountain god")&lt;ref&gt;Lipiński, Edward. “Elaha Gabal d’Émèse Dans Son Contexte Historique.” Latomus, vol. 70, no. 4, Societe d’Etudes Latines de Bruxelles, 2011, pp. 1081–101, http://www.jstor.org/stable/41547069.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Ancient Semitic religion|Arab]]-[[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[sun god]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shahid|first=Irfan|title=Rome and the Arabs|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks|year=1984|isbn=0-88402-115-7|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=36|quote="Just as the pagan Arab cult of the sun-god of Emesa is a relevant feature of background for the interest of the Severi in religion and in the case of Elagabalus for the installation of the Arab sun-god in Rome itself"}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially venerated in [[Emesa]] (modern-day [[Homs]]), [[Syria]]. Although there were many variations of the name, the god was consistently referred to as Elagabalus in Roman coins and inscriptions from AD 218 on, during the reign of emperor [[Elagabalus]].&lt;ref&gt;Martijn Icks, ''The Crimes of Elagabalus: The Life and Legacy of Rome's Decadent Boy Emperor'' (2011) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult==

Elagabalus was initially venerated at Emesa in [[Syria]], where the Arab [[Emesan dynasty]] acted as its priests. The name is the [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] form of the Arabic "Ilah al-Jabal" ("إله الجبل"), the Emesene manifestation of the deity, which is Arabic for "God of the Mountain."&lt;ref name="Ball p.37"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rome in the East: The Transformation of an Empire|last1=Ball|first1=Warwick|author-link=Warwick Ball|publisher=Routledge|date=2016|isbn=9780415717779|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Juristic Papyrology'', volume 23, page 116: "und mit palmyrenischer Inschrift "Gott Berg" steht die umstrittene Etymologie des Namens "Elagabal" (ilah ha-gabal) fest"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English-Arabic dictionary translation for "God" with transliteration of the Arabic equivalent: "ilah": &lt;nowiki&gt;https://en.bab.la/dictionary/english-arabic/god&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English-Arabic dictionary translation for "mountain" with transliteration of the Arabic equivalent: "gabal": &lt;nowiki&gt;https://en.bab.la/dictionary/english-arabic/mountain&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Elagabalus was the religious "lord", or [[Ba'al]], of Emesa.&lt;ref name="Ball p.37"/&gt; The deity successfully preserved Arab characteristics, both in his names and in his representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bowman, Cameron, Garnsey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MNSyT_PuYVMC&amp;q=characteristics+both+in+his+names&amp;pg=PA502|title=The Cambridge Ancient History: Volume 12, The Crisis of Empire, AD 193-337|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521850735|pages=502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cult of the deity spread to other parts of the Roman Empire in the second century, where he would be revered as '''Elagabalos''' (Ἐλαγάβαλος ''Elagábalos'') by the Greeks and Elagabalus by the Romans. For example, a dedication has been found as far away as [[Woerden]], in the modern-day [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rambambashi.wordpress.com/2008/05/22/an-early-dedication-to-elagabal/ An Early Dedication to Elagabal], [https://web.archive.org/web/20210126201406/https://rambambashi.wordpress.com/2008/05/22/an-early-dedication-to-elagabal/ archived] on 2021-01-26; the inscription is in now in Woerden's city museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Rome==
The cult stone or [[baetyl]] was brought to Rome by the [[Roman emperor|Emperor]] [[Elagabalus|Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus]], who, before his accession, was the hereditary high priest at Emesa and was commonly called Elagabalus after the deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last = Halsberghe | first = Gaston H. | title = The Cult of Sol Invictus | year = 1972 | location = Leiden | publisher = Brill | pages = 62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrian deity was assimilated with the Roman sun god known as [[Sol (Roman mythology)|Sol]] and later [[Sol Invictus]] ("the unconquered Sun").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Devlaminck, Pieter | title = De Cultus van Sol Invictus: Een vergelijkende studie tussen keizer Elagabalus (218–222) en keizer Aurelianus (270–275) | publisher = University of Ghent | year=  2004 | language = nl | url = http://www.ethesis.net/invictus/invictus_inhoud.htm | access-date = 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A temple called the [[Elagabalium]] was built on the east face of the [[Palatine Hill]] to house the holy stone of the Emesa temple, a [[Baetylus|black conical meteorite]].&lt;ref name="herodian-history-v-5"&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [https://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre505.html V.5]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodian]] writes of that stone:

{{Quote|This stone is worshipped as though it were sent from heaven; on it there are some small projecting pieces and markings that are pointed out, which the people would like to believe are a rough picture of the sun, because this is how they see them.&lt;ref name="herodian-history-v-3"&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [https://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre503.html V.3]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Elagabalus Aureus Sol Invictus.png|thumb|right|Roman [[aureus]] depicting Elagabalus. The reverse reads ''Sanct Deo Soli Elagabal'' (''To the Holy Sun God Elagabal''), and depicts a [[quadriga|four-horse]], gold chariot carrying the holy stone of the Emesa temple.]]
Herodian also related that Elagabalus forced senators to watch while he danced around his deity's altar to the sound of drums and cymbals,&lt;ref name="herodian-history-v-5"/&gt; and at each [[solstice|summer solstice]] celebrated a great festival, popular with the masses because of food distributions,&lt;ref name="herodian-history-v-6"/&gt; during which he placed the holy stone on a [[chariot]] adorned with gold and jewels, which he paraded through the city:

{{Quote|A six horse chariot carried the divinity, the horses huge and flawlessly white, with expensive gold fittings and rich ornaments. No one held the reins, and no one rode in the chariot; the vehicle was escorted as if the god himself were the charioteer. Elagabalus ran backward in front of the chariot, facing the god and holding the horses' reins. He made the whole journey in this reverse fashion, looking up into the face of his god.&lt;ref name="herodian-history-v-6"/&gt;}}

Herodian's description strongly suggests that the Emesene cult was inspired by the [[Babylonia]]n [[Akitu|Akitu-festival]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Geller, "The Last Wedge", in ''Zeitschrift für Assyriologie''  87 (1997), pp. 43–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Cassius Dio]], the Emperor also tried to bring about a union of Roman and Syrian religion under the supremacy of his deity, which he placed even above [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]],&lt;ref name="dio-history-lxxx-11"&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html#79-11 LXXX.11]&lt;/ref&gt; and to which he assigned either [[Astarte]], [[Minerva]] or [[Urania]], or some combination of the three, as wife.&lt;ref name="herodian-history-v-6"&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [https://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre506.html V.6] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104155215/http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre506.html |date=2015-11-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The most sacred relics from the Roman religion were transferred from their respective shrines to the Elagabalium, including "the emblem of [[Cybele|the Great Mother]], the fire of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], the [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]], the [[Ancile|shields]] of the [[Salii]], and all that the Romans held sacred". He reportedly also declared that [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Samaritans]] and [[Christianity|Christians]] must transfer their rites to his temple so that it "might include the mysteries of every form of worship".&lt;ref&gt;''Augustan History'', Life of Elagabalus [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Elagabalus/1*.html#3.4 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Herodian, after the emperor was killed in 222, his religious edicts were reversed and the cult of Elagabalus returned to Emesa.&lt;ref name="herodian-history-vi-1"&gt;Herodian, ''Roman History'' [https://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre601.html VI.6]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sancus.png|thumb|Illustration of a statue of Sancus found in the Sabine's shrine on the Quirinal, near the modern church of S. Silvestro]]
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''Sancus''' (also known as '''Sangus''' or '''Semo Sancus''') was a [[god]] of trust ({{Lang|la|fides}}), honesty, and oaths. His [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]], one of the most ancient amongst the Romans, probably derived from [[Umbrian]] influences.{{efn|
[Dius Fidius] ist [...] bereits mit Semo Sancus gleichgesetzt, dem anderen Schwurgott, den die römische Religion kennt. Dius Fidius und Semo sind [...] in alter Zeit verschiedene Gottheiten gewesen; die Verbindung im Eide hat die beiden für die römischen Gelehrten und vielleicht nicht nur für diese zu einem Gott gemacht.[...] Er hatte einen Tempel auf dem Quirinal, [...] der im J. 466 v. Chr. geweiht ist, während man die Erbauung schon König Tarquinius zuschrieb. Da er auf dem Quirinal lag, sollte er nach anderen von den Sabinern des T. Tatius gegründet sein.&lt;ref name=Latte-1967-1972/&gt;
}} [[Cato the Elder|Cato]]&lt;ref&gt;
In a fragment preserved by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], 2.49.2.
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Silius Italicus]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[Silius Italicus]] ''Punica'' VIII 421.
&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that Sancus was a [[Sabine]] god and father of the [[eponym]]ous Sabine hero [[Sabus]]. He is thus sometimes considered a [[founding myth|founder-deity]].

==Oaths==
Sancus was the god who protected oaths of marriage, hospitality, law, [[commerce]], and particularly formal [[contract]]s. Some of the oaths said at the moment of signing a contract – or other important civil promissory acts – named Sancus as guarantor, and called on him to protect and guard over the honour and integrity of the signatories' pledges.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

==Etymology==
The place-name {{Lang|la|Sanguineto}} is related to the [[theonym]], through the proper name {{Lang|la|Sanquinius}}.&lt;ref name=Palmer-1994/&gt;{{rp|page=16}}&lt;ref name=Norden-1939/&gt;{{rp|page=215}}

''Sancus'' derives from a [[Latin language|Latin]]/[[Umbrian language|Umbrian]]/[[Sabine language|Sabine]] source (compare Umbrian ''sacra''/ '''sakra''' "sacred", and the Umbrian theonym ''Sansi''/'''Saçi'''), and is connected to [[Latin language|Latin]] {{Lang|la|sancire}} ('to hallow') and hence ''[[saint|sanctus]]'' ('hallowed') and [[English language|English]] ''saint'', ''sacred'', ''sanctuary'', ''sanctity'' and ''sanction''.

Outside Italic, Hittite has a number of words such as ''saklai'' "rites" and ''sankunnis'' "priest" that seem to be clear cognates, suggesting an [[Indo-European]] root *''sank-/*sak-'' "to sanctify".&lt;ref&gt;etymonline https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=sacred&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible, however, that the former was a loan from Akkadian ''sakku(m)'' 'cultic rites,'&lt;ref&gt;Black, J. et alia (1999) ''A Concise Dictionary of Akkadian'' p.313 https://books.google.com/books?id=-qIuVCsRb98C&amp;pg=PA313&amp;lpg=PA313&amp;dq=sakku+akkadian+%27rites%27&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BsedulPTFx&amp;sig=ACfU3U2bql0byM9t2iB_puQwL9_5wr9S5Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjWmJDwqfX0AhX-kYkEHRJzBn0Q6AF6BAgYEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=sakku%20akkadian%20'rites'&amp;f=false/&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter may be a loan word from [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''sanga'' "administrative priest".&lt;ref&gt;historynet: Mesopotamian Priests and Priestesses https://www.historyonthenet.com/mesopotamian-priests-and-priestesses/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ids online hittite dictionary https://ids.clld.org/units/208-911/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger D. Woodard|Woodard]]&lt;ref name=Woodard-2006/&gt; has  interpreted Sancus as the Roman equivalent of Vedic god [[Indra]] (whose name is likely related to Sanskrit ''indu'' "rain drop"), who has to rely on the help of the [[Maruts]], in his view corresponding to the twelfth Roman {{Lang|la|semones}} of the [[carmen Arvale]], in his task of killing the dragon [[Vrtra]] thus freeing the waters and averting draught. He traces the etymology of ''Semo'' to [[Indo-European languages|PIE]] stem root *{{Lang|mis|sh₂e(w)-}}&lt;!-- Indo-European --&gt; bearing the meanings of 'to pour', 'ladle', 'flow', 'drop' related to rain and sowing.&lt;ref name=Fowler-1899/&gt;{{rp|page=140}}&lt;ref name=Woodard-2006/&gt;{{rp|pages=186&amp;nbsp;ff}} (See more below at "Mars and Semo")

==Worship==
The temple dedicated to Sancus stood on the [[Quirinal Hill]], under the name '''{{Lang|la|Semo Sancus Dius Fidius}}'''.

[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |author=[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] |title={{math|Ῥωμαϊκὴ Ἀρχαιολογία}} |trans-title=Roman Antiquities |at=II 49, 2}}
&lt;/ref&gt; writes that the worship of Semo Sancus was imported into Rome at a very early time by the [[Sabines]] who occupied the Quirinal Hill. According to tradition his cult was said to have been introduced by the Sabines and perhaps king [[Titus Tatius]] dedicated a small shrine.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |author=[[Ovid]] |title=[[Fasti]] |at=VI 217–218}} &lt;br/&gt;
Properce IV 9, 74; &lt;br/&gt;

{{cite book |author=[[Varro]] |title=Lingua Latina |at=V 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|
Note that [[Varro]] does not mention Sancus in the list of gods at {{cite book |author=[[Varro]] |title=Lingua Latina |at=V 72}} to whom [[Titus Tatius|King Tatius]] dedicated shrines.
}} The actual construction of the temple is generally ascribed to [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], although it was dedicated by [[Spurius Postumius Albus Regillensis (consul 466 BC)|Spurius Postumius]] on 5&amp;nbsp;June 466&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;

{{cite book |first1=S.B. |last1=Platner |first2=T. |last2=Ashby |year=1929 |title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome |place=London, GB |pages=469–470}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |pages=469–470}}

Sancus was considered the son of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], an opinion recorded by [[Varro]] and attributed to his teacher [[Aelius Stilo]].&lt;ref name=Varro-Latin-lang&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Varro]] |title=Lingua Latina |at=V 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the god of heavenly light, the avenger of dishonesty, the upholder of truth and good faith, the sanctifier of agreements. Hence his identification with [[Hercules]], who was likewise the guardian of the sanctity of oaths. His festival day occurred on the {{Lang|la|nonae}} of June (5&amp;nbsp;June).

===Shrine on Quirinal===
The shrine on the Quirinal was described by 19th&amp;nbsp;century archeologist R.A. Lanciani.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |first=R.A. |last=Lanciani |year=1893 |title=Pagan and Christian Rome |place=Boston, MA; New York, NY |pages=32–33}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It was located near the {{Lang|la|Porta Sanqualis}} of the Servian walls,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |author=[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] |title=s.v. Sanqualis Porta |page=345 L}}
&lt;/ref&gt; not far from the modern church of [[San Silvestro al Quirinale]], precisely on the {{Lang|la|Collis Mucialis}}.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |author=[[Varro]] |title=Lingua Latina |at=V 52 |quote=''Collis Mucialis: Quinticeps apud aedem Dei Fidi; in delubro ubi aeditumus habere solet''.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It was described by classical writers as having no roof so as oaths could be taken under the sky.

It had a chapel containing relics of the regal period: A bronze statue of [[Tanaquil]] or [[Gaia]] [[Caecilia]], her belt containing remedies that people came to collect, her distaff, spindle, and slippers,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |author=[[Plutarch]] |title=Quaestiones Romanae |at=30 }} &lt;br/&gt;
{{cite book |author=[[Pliny the Elder]] |title=Natural History |at=VIII 94 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|
''Praebia rursus Verrius vocari ait ea remedia quae Gaia Caecilia, uxor Tarquini Prisci, invenisse existimatur, et inmiscuisse zonae suae, qua praecincta statua eius est in aede Sancus, qui deus dius fidius vocatur; et qua zona periclitantes ramenta sumunt. Ea vocari ait praebia, quod mala prohibeant.''}}&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |author=[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] |title=&lt;/i&gt;s.v.&lt;i&gt;praebia |page=276 L}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and after the capture of [[Priverno|Privernum]] in 329&amp;nbsp;BCE, brass medallions or bronze wheels (discs) made of the money confiscated from [[Vitruvius Vaccus]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |author=[[Livy]] |title=[no title cited] |at=VIII 20, 8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Dionysius of Halicarnassus records that the treaty between Rome and [[Gabii]] was preserved in this temple. This treaty was perhaps the first international treaty to be recorded and preserved in written form in ancient Rome. It was written on the skin of the ox sacrificed to the god upon its agreement and fixed onto a wooden frame or a  shield.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |author=[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] |title={{math|Ῥωμαϊκὴ Ἀρχαιολογία}} |trans-title=Roman Antiquities |at=IV 58, 4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lanciani the foundations of the temple were discovered in March&amp;nbsp;1881, under what was formerly the convent of [[San Silvestro al Quirinale]] (or {{Lang|it|degli Arcioni}}), later the headquarters of the (former) Royal Engineers. Lanciani relates the monument was a parallelogram in shape, thirty-five feet long by nineteen wide, with walls of [[travertine]] and decorations in white [[marble]]. It was surrounded by votive altars and the pedestal of statues. In Latin literature it is sometimes called [[Aedes (Roman religion)|aedes]], sometimes [[sacellum]], this last appellation probably connected to the fact it was a sacred space in the open air.&lt;ref name=Platner-Ashby-1929/&gt;{{rp|page=469}} Platner &amp; Ashby (1929)&lt;ref name=Platner-Ashby-1929/&gt; though write that its foundations had already been detected in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century.

Lanciani supposes the statue depicted in this article might have been found on the site of the shrine on the [[Quirinal]] as it appeared in the antiquarian market of Rome at the time of the excavations at [[San Silvestro al Quirinale|San Silvestro]].

===Statue and shrine on Tiber Island and others===
Semo Sancus had a large sanctuary at Velitrae, now [[Velletri]], in [[Volscian language|Volscian]] territory.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |author=[[Livy]] |title=[no title cited] |at=XXXII 1, 10}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

There was possibly another shrine or altar ({{Lang|la|ara}}) dedicated to Semo Sancus on the [[Isle of the Tiber]], near the temple of {{Lang|la|Iupiter Iurarius}}. This altar bears the inscription seen and misread by [[Justin Martyr|Justin]] ({{Lang|la|Semoni Sanco Deo}} read as {{Lang|la|Simoni Deo Sancto}}) and was discovered on the island in July&amp;nbsp;1574. It is preserved in the {{Lang|la|Galleria Lapidaria}} of the Vatican Museum, first compartment ({{Lang|la|Dii}} gallery). Lanciani advances the hypothesis that while the shrine on the Quirinal was of [[Sabines|Sabine]] origin that on the Tiber island was [[Latins|Latin]].
Claridge (1998) reports that the statue of Sancus (inscribed {{Lang|la|Semo Sancus Dius Fidus}}) was found on the [[Tiber Island]].&lt;ref name=Claridge-1998&gt;
{{cite book |last=Claridge |first=Amanda |year=1998 |title=Rome: An Oxford archaeological guide |place=Oxford, GB |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=226}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue is life-sized and is of the [[kouros|archaic Apollo (kouros)]] type. The expression of the face and the modeling of the body however are realistic. Both hands are missing, so that it is impossible to say what were the attributes of the god, one being perhaps the club of Hercules and/or the ''[[ossifrage]]'', the augural bird proper to the god ({{Lang|la|avis sanqualis}}), hypotheses made by archaeologist Visconti and reported by [[Lanciani, Rodolfo Amadeo|Lanciani]]. Other scholars think he should have held lightning bolts in his left hand.

The inscription on the pedestal mentions a {{Lang|la|decuria sacerdot[um] bidentalium}}.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]] |volume=VI |id=568}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Lanciani makes reference to a glossa of [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] s.v. {{Lang|la|bidentalia}} which states these were small shrines of lesser divinities, to whom {{Lang|la|hostiae bidentes}}, i.e. lambs two years old, were sacrificed. [[William Warde Fowler|Fowler]] (1899)&lt;ref name=Fowler-1899/&gt; says these priests should have been concerned with lightning bolts, {{Lang|la|bidental}} being both the technical term for the {{Lang|la|puteal}}, the hole (resembling a well) left by strikes onto the ground and for the victims used to placate the god and purify the site.&lt;ref name=Fowler-1899/&gt;{{rp|page=139}}

==={{Lang|la|Sacerdotes bidentales}} – priests of Semo Sancus===
For this reason the priests of Semo Sancus were called {{Lang|la|sacerdotes bidentales}}. They were organised, like a lay corporation, in a {{Lang|la|decuria}} under the presidency of a {{Lang|la|magister quinquennalis}}.

Their residence at the shrine on the Quirinal was located adjoining the chapel: it was ample and commodious, provided with a supply of water by means of a lead pipe.
The pipes have been removed to the [[Capitoline Museum]]. They bear the same inscription found on the base of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]] |volume=XV |id=7253}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The statue is now housed in the {{Lang|la|Galleria dei Candelabri}} of the Vatican Palace.
The foundations of the shrine on the [[Quirinal]] were destroyed.

===Simon Magus===
[[Justin Martyr]] records that [[Simon Magus]], a gnostic mentioned in the Christian Bible, performed such miracles by magic acts during the reign of [[Claudius]] that he was regarded as a god and honored with a statue on the island in the Tiber which the two bridges cross, with the inscription {{Lang|la|Simoni Deo Sancto}}, 'to Simon the Holy God'.&lt;ref name=Justin&gt;
{{cite book |author=[[Justin Martyr]] |chapter=Chapter&amp;nbsp;XXVI — Magicians not trusted by Christians |title=[[First Apology of Justin Martyr|The First Apology]] |chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.ii.xxvi.html}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in 1574, the Semo Sancus statue was unearthed on the island in question, leading most scholars to believe that [[Justin Martyr|Justin]] confused {{Lang|la|Semoni Sanco}} with ''[[Simon Magus]]''.

==Origins and significance==
{{Ancient Roman religion}}
Even in the ancient world, confusion surrounded this deity, as evidenced by the multiple and unstable forms of his name. [[Lucius Aelius Stilo Praeconinus|Aelius Stilo]]&lt;ref&gt;
Preserved in {{cite book |author=[[Varro]] |title=[[De lingua latina]] |at=5.66}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
identified him with [[Hercules]], and explained also that because the god was called by the Romans "[[Dius Fidius]]", he was a son of Jove by interpreting the expression ''Dius Fidius'' as ''Diovis Filius'' (son of Jove); and in order to further clarify the notion of Semo Sancus as a son of Jupiter, he explained the meaning of the expression "Diovis Filius" meaning "son of Jove" by comparing it as an example to the Greek word "[[Dioskouros]]" applied to Castor; and claimed that just as the Greeks call for example Castor a "Dioskouros" i.e. a "young boy" or "son" (kouros) of Zeus (Dios); the same way the Romans called Sancus a "Diovis Filius" - a "son of Jove". In [[late antiquity]], [[Martianus Capella]] places Sancus in region&amp;nbsp;12 of his cosmological system, which draws on Etruscan tradition in associating gods with specific parts of the sky.&lt;ref name=Weinstock-1946&gt;
{{cite journal |first=Stefan |last=Weinstock |year=1946 |title=Martianus Capella and the cosmic system of the Etruscans |journal=Journal of Roman Studies |volume=36 |page=105, esp. [note&amp;nbsp;19] |doi=10.2307/298044 |jstor=298044 |s2cid=161832349 |postscript=:}}
[[Martianus Capella|Martianus]] is likely to have derived his system from [[Varro]], and through an intermediate source, from [[Nigidius Figulus]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
On the Piacenza Liver the corresponding case bears the theonym ''[[Tluscv]]''.
The complexity of the theonym and the multiple relationships of the god with other divine figures shall be better examined in a systematic wise here below.

===Sancus as {{Lang|la|Semo}}===
The first part of the theonym defines the god as belonging to the category of the {{Lang|la|Semones}} or {{Lang|la|Semunes}}, divine entities of the ancient Romans and Italics.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Martianus Capella]], II 156
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Fulgentius ''De Sermone  Antiquorum'' 11
&lt;/ref&gt;
In a fragment from [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], quoted in Dionysius of Halicarnassus (II 49 1-2), Sancus is referred to as {{math|δαίμων}} and not {{math|θεός}}.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Cato the Elder|Marcus Porcius Cato]], cited in {{cite book |author=[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] |title=[[Roman Antiquities]] |at=II 49 1-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome this theonym is attested in the [[carmen Arvale]] (''semunis alternei advocapit conctos'' repeated thrice) and in two fragmentary inscriptions: CIL V 567 ''Semoni Sanco Deo Fidio ... decur(ia) bidentalis donum dedit'' and CIL V 568 ''Sanco Sancto Semoni Deo Fidio sacrum decuria sacerdotum bidentalium''
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]] |volume=I |edition=2nd |id=2436 |quote=Se]''monibu''[s}} The reconstruction is uncertain.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside Rome in Sabine, Umbrian and Pelignan territory:&lt;ref name=Norden-1939/&gt;{{rp|pages=205 ff}} An inscription from [[Corfinium]] in [[Umbrian]] reads: {{Lang|la|Çerfom sacaracicer Semunes sua[d}}, 'priest of the Çerfi and the Semones', placing side by side the two entities {{Lang|la|çerfi}} and {{Lang|la|semunes}}. The {{Lang|la|çerfi}} are mentioned in the [[Iguvine Tables]] in association with Mars e.g. in expressions as {{Lang|la|Çerfer Martier}}. Their interpretation remains obscure: an etymological and semantic relation to PIE root {{lang|mis|*ker-}}&lt;!-- Indo-European --&gt;, meaning 'growth', is possible though problematic and debated, since that root also means "horn, head" which would suggest a horned deity.

Also in [[Umbrian]], in the [[Iguvine Tables]], the b side of tablet II begins "'''seminies tekuries'''" which is interpreted to be a "decurial [festival] to Semo..." where a pig and goat sacrifice were performed, though the opening lines of this tablet are difficult to translate with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Poultney, J.W. "Bronze Tables of Iguvium"  1959 p. 190 - 191 https://archive.org/details/bronzetablesofig00poul/page/n19/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ancient Latin sources, the meaning of the term {{Lang|la|semones}} would denote {{Lang|la|semihomines}} (also explained as {{Lang|la|se-homines}}, men separated from ordinary ones, who have left their human condition: the prefix ''{{Not a typo|se-}}'' both in Latin and Greek may denote segregation), or the {{Lang|la|dii medioxumi}}, i.e. gods of the second rank, or semigods,&lt;ref&gt;
Festus s.v. ''medioxumi''.
&lt;/ref&gt;
entities that belong to the intermediate sphere between gods and men.&lt;ref name=Scheiffele-Pauly-sv-Semones&gt;
Scheiffele in ''Pauly Real Encyclopaedie der Altertumwissenschaften'' s.v. ''Semones'' citing Priscianus p. 683.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Fulgentius ''De Sermone Antiquorum'' 11;
Festus s.v. ''hemona'';
Varro (unreferenced) from ''semideus'';
Hartung I. 41: from ''serere'' and Sabine ''Semones'' half-self, more like ''genii'';
also Gdywend ''Mythologie bei der Romer'' par. 261: in Sabine, godly people, maybe Lares. Besides all the ''dii medioxumi'' belong to this category.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The relationship of these entities to {{Lang|la|Semo Sancus}} is comparable to that  of the {{Lang|la|genii}} to {{Lang|la|Genius Iovialis}}: as among the {{Lang|la|genii}} there is a {{Lang|la|Genius Iovialis}}, thus similarly among the {{Lang|la|semones}} there is a {{Lang|la|Semo Sancus}}.&lt;ref name=Scheiffele-Pauly-sv-Semones/&gt; The {{Lang|la|semones}} would then be a class of semigods, i.e. people who did not share the destiny of ordinary mortals even though they were not admitted to Heaven, such as [[Faunus]], [[Priapus]], [[Picus]], the [[Silvani]].&lt;ref&gt;
cf. Ovid ''Metamorphoses'' I 193-195.
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, some scholars opine such a definition is wrong and the {{Lang|la|semones}} are spirits of nature, representing the generative power hidden in seeds (Latin ''semina'').&lt;ref&gt;
Dahrenberg &amp; Saglio ''Dictionnaire des Antiquites Grecques et Romaines'' s.v. ''Semo Sancus.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In ancient times only offers of milk were allowed to the {{Lang|la|semones}}.{{efn|
"Rumam veteres dixerunt mammam. Varro ''Cato'' vel ''De liberis educandis'': dis Semonibus lacte fit, non vino; Cuninae propter cunis, Ruminae propter rumam, id est, prisco vocabulo, mammam&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The deity [[Semonia]] bears characters that link her to the group of the {{Lang|la|Semones}}, as is shown by [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] s.v. {{Lang|la|supplicium}}: when a citizen was put to death the custom was to sacrifice a lamb of two years ({{Lang|la|bidentis}}) to Semonia to appease  her and purify the community. Only thereafter could the head and property of the culprit be vowed to the appropriate god. That Semo Sancus received the same kind of cult and sacrifice is shown in the inscription (see figure in this article) now under the statue of the god reading {{Lang|la|decuria sacerdotum bidentalium}}.

{{anchor|Trita_Apya}}
The relationship between Sancus and the {{Lang|la|semones}} of the carmen Arvale remains obscure, even though some scholars opine that Semo Sancus and {{Lang|la|Salus Semonia}} or {{Lang|la|Dia Semonia}} would represent the core significance of this archaic theology. It has also been proposed to understand this relationship in the light of that between Vedic god [[Indra]] or his companion Trita Āpya and the [[Maruts]].&lt;ref name=Pighi-1967&gt;

===Sancus and Salus===
The two gods were related in several ways. Their shrines ({{Lang|la|aedes}}) were very close to each other on two adjacent hilltops of the Quirinal, the {{Lang|la|Collis Mucialis}} and {{Lang|la|Salutaris}} respectively.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Varro]] ''[[Lingua Latina]]'' V 53

Some scholars also claim some inscriptions to Sancus have been found on the {{Lang|la|Collis Salutaris}}.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; as related in their sacrality: {{Lang|la|Salus}}, {{Lang|la|Semonia}}, {{Lang|la|Seia}}, {{Lang|la|Segetia}}, {{Lang|la|Tutilina}}, who required the observance of a {{Lang|la|dies feriatus}} of the person who happened to utter their name. These deities were connected to the ancient agrarian cults of the valley of the [[Circus Maximus]] that remain quite mysterious.&lt;ref name=Dumézil-1974-1977/&gt;{{rp|at=vol&amp;nbsp;I}}&lt;ref&gt;

The statue of Tanaquil placed in the shrine of Sancus was famed for containing remedies in its girdle which people came to collect, named {{Lang|la|praebia}}.&lt;ref&gt;

===Sancus Dius Fidius and Jupiter===
The relationship between the two gods is certain as both are in charge of oath, are connected with clear daylight sky and can wield lightning bolts. This overlap of functional characters has generated confusion about the identity of Sancus Dius Fidius either among ancient and modern scholars, as Dius Fidius has sometimes been considered another theonym for Iupiter.&lt;ref name=Dumézil-1974-1977&gt;
{{cite book |first=G. |last=Dumézil |author-link=Georges Dumézil |year=1974 |title=La religion Roamaine archaïque |place=Paris, FR |language=fr}} Italian translation Milan (1977) p.&amp;nbsp;189.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The autonomy of Semo Sancus from Jupiter and the fact that Dius Fidius is an alternate theonym designating Semo Sancus (and not Jupiter) is shown by the name of the correspondent Umbrian god ''Fisus Sansi'' which compounds the two constituent parts of ''Sancus'' and ''Dius Fidius'': in [[Umbrian]] and Sabine {{Lang|la|Fisus}} is the exact correspondent of {{Lang|la|Fidius}}, as e.g. Sabine Clausus of Latin Claudius.&lt;ref name=Rosenzweig-1937/&gt;&lt;ref name=Briquel-1979/&gt;{{efn|

''Iupater Sancius'' is identical with ''Semo Sancus Dius Fidius'' of the Latins. Here we see ''Fisus Sancius'' who originally was an attribute of ''Iupater'' himself in his function of the guardian of ''Fides'', to develop into a separate god with a sphere of his own as preserver of oaths and treaties ... The Umbrian god ... with the combination of the two forms of the Roman god in his name performs a real service in establishing the unity of ''Dius Fidius'' and ''Semo Sancus'' as the one god ''Semo Sancus Dius Fidius''.&lt;ref name=Norden-1939/&gt;
}}  But ''Sansi''/'''Saçi''' also occurs with ''Iupater'', as well as alone, and with the Umbrian theonyms ''Fisovius'' and ''Vesticius.''

The fact that Sancus as Iupiter is in charge of the observance of oaths, of the laws of hospitality and of loyalty (''Fides'') makes him a deity connected with the sphere and values of sovereignty, i.e. what [[Georges Dumézil|Dumézil]] calls "the first function".&lt;ref name=Dumézil-1974-1977/&gt;

[[Georg Wissowa|Wissowa]] (1909,&lt;ref name=Wissowa-1909/&gt; 1912&lt;ref name=Wissowa-1912/&gt;{{rp|pages=131 ff}}) advanced the hypothesis that Semo Sancus is the [[Genius (mythology)|'genius']] of Jupiter. Fowler (1899)&lt;ref name=Fowler-1899/&gt; cautioned that this interpretation looks to be an anachronism, and it would only be acceptable to say that Sancus is a ''Genius Iovius'', as it appears from the [[Iguvine Tables]];&lt;ref name=Fowler-1899/&gt;{{rp|page=189}} the concept of a ''genius'' of a '''''deity''''' is attested only in the imperial period.

[[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]],{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} [[William Warde Fowler|Fowler]],&lt;ref name=Fowler-1899/&gt; and [[Georges Dumézil|Dumézil]],&lt;ref name=Dumézil-1974-1977/&gt; among others, rejected the accountability of the tradition that ascribes a [[Sabine]] origin to the Roman cult of Semo Sancus Dius Fidius, partly on linguistic grounds since the theonym is Latin and no mention or evidence of a Sabine {{Lang|la|Semo}} is found near Rome, while the {{Lang|la|Semones}} are attested in Latin in the [[carmen Arvale]]. In their view Sancus would be a deity who was shared by all ancient Italic peoples, whether Osco-Umbrian or Latino-Faliscan.{{refn|

confirm the parallelism.

Some aspects of the ritual of the oath for Dius Fidius, such as the proceedings under the open sky and/or in the {{Lang|la|compluvium}} of private residences and the fact the temple of Sancus had no roof, have suggested to romanist O. Sacchi the idea that the oath by Dius Fidius predated that for {{Lang|la|Iuppiter Lapis}} or {{Lang|la|Iuppiter Feretrius}}, and should have its origin in prehistoric time rituals, when the {{Lang|la|templum}} was in the open air and defined by natural landmarks as e.g. the highest nearby tree.{{efn|
Sacchi (2001) cites [[Nonius Marcellus]] s.v. ''rituis'' (L p. 494): &lt;br/&gt;
:''Itaque domi rituis nostri, qui per dium Fidium iurare vult, prodire solet in compluvium.''
:("thus according to our rites he who wishes to swear an oath by Dius Fidius he as a rule walks to the ''compluvium'' [an unroofed space within the house]").&lt;ref name=Sacchi-2001&gt;
{{cite journal |first=O. |last=Sacchi |title=Il trivaso del Quirinale |journal=Revue internationale de droit de l'Antiquité |year=2001 |pages=309–311}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
}}&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |author=[[Macrobius]] |title=Saturnalia |at=III 11, 5}} discussed the use of the private ''mensa'' as an altar mentioned in the ''ius Papirianum''; &lt;br/&gt;
{{cite book |author=[[Granius Flaccus]] |title=Indigitamenta |at=8 (H. 109)}}
describes king [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]]'s vow, by which he asked for the divine punishment of  perjury by all the gods.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Supporting this interpretation is the explanation of the theonym Sancus as meaning ''sky'' in Sabine given by Johannes Lydus, etymology that however is rejected by [[Georges Dumézil|Dumézil]] and Briquel&lt;ref name=Briquel-1979/&gt; among others.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |author=[[Lydus]] |title=[[De Mensibus]] |at=IV 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Capdeville-1995&gt;
{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Capdeville |year=1995 |title=Les dieux de Martianus Capella |journal=Revue de l'histoire des religions |page=290}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is also contradicted by the fact that the first element of ''Ju-piter'' goes back to [Proto-Indo-European] *diēu- "bright (sky)," and that the cognate Indo-European deities of ''Jupiter'' (such as Old Norse ''Tyr'') are also connected with oath keeping.

All the known details concerning Sancus connect him to the sphere of the {{Lang|la|fides}}, of oaths, of the respect of compacts and of their sanction, i.e. divine guarantee against their breach. These values are all proper to sovereign gods and common with Iuppiter (and with [[Mitra]] in [[Vedic mythology|Vedic religion]]).

===Sancus and Hercules===
Aelius Stilo's interpretation of the theonym as {{Lang|la|Dius Filius}} is based partly on the interchangeability and alternation of letters ''d'' and ''l'' in Sabine, which might have rendered possible the reading of ''Dius Fidius'' as ''Dius Filius'', i.e. Dios Kouros, partly on the function of guarantor of oaths that Sancus shared with Hercules: [[Georg Wissowa|Wissowa]] called it a {{Lang|de|gelehrte Kombination}},&lt;ref name=Wissowa-1909/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wissowa-1912/&gt; while interpreting him as the [[genius]] ({{Lang|la|semo}}) of Iupiter.&lt;ref name=Fowler-1899/&gt;{{rp|page=136}} who is rather critical of this interpretation of Wissowa's.
Stilo's interpretation in its linguistic aspect looks to be unsupported by the form of the theonym in the [[Iguvine Tables]], where it appears as ''Fisus'' or ''Fisovius Sancius'', a formula that includes the two component parts of the theonym.&lt;ref name=Fowler-1899/&gt;{{rp|page=137}}{{refn|
Rosenzweig (1937)&lt;ref name=Rosenzweig-1937/&gt;{{rp|page=275}}
quoted by Norden (1939):&lt;ref name=Norden-1939/&gt;&lt;ref name=Briquel-1979/&gt;{{rp|pages=134–135}}
* ''Datives'' Ia 15 Fiso Saci, VI b 3 Fiso Sansie; vocative VI b 9, 10, 12, 14 , 15 Fisovie Sansie;
* ''accusative'' VI b 8 Fisovi Sansi;
* ''genitive'' VI b15 Fisovie Sansie;
* ''dative'' VI b 5,6, VII a 37 Fisovi Sansi; I a 17 Fisovi.
}}
This theonym is rooted in an ancient [[Indo-European languages|IE]] ''*''{{Lang|mis|bh(e)idh-tos}}&lt;!-- Indo-European --&gt; and is formed on the root stem ''*''{{Lang|mis|bheidh-}}&lt;!-- Indo-European --&gt; which is common to Latin {{Lang|la|Fides}}.

The connexion to Hercules looks to be much more substantial on theological grounds. Hercules, especially in ancient Italy, retained many archaic features of a founder deity and of a guarantor of good faith and loyalty. The relationship with Jupiter of the two characters could be considered analogous. Hence both some ancient scholars such as [[Varro]] and [[Macrobius]] and modern ones as Woodard (2006)&lt;ref name=Woodard-2006/&gt; consider them as one.

===Sancus and Mars===
At Iguvium Fisus, Sancius is associated to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] in the ritual of the sacrifice at the {{Lang|la|Porta}} ('Gate') {{Lang|la|Tesenaca}} as one of the gods of the minor triad{{efn|
The major triad is composed of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Iove]], [[Mars (mythology)|Marte]], and [[Veiovis|Vofiune]], termed the ''Grabovii''; beside it there is minor one whose components are associated each with one of the ''Grabovii'': ''Trebus Iovius'' with Iove, ''Fisus Sancius'' with Marte and ''Tefer Iovius'' with Vofiune respectively. cf. Briquel (1979)&lt;ref name=Briquel-1979/&gt;{{rp|page=136}}
}} and this fact proves his military connection in Umbria. This might be explained by the military nature of the concept of ''sanction'' which implies the use of repression. The term {{Lang|la|sanctus}} too has in Roman law military implications: the walls of the city are {{Lang|la|sancti}}.&lt;ref name=Briquel-1979&gt;
{{cite book |first=D. |last=Briquel |year=1979 |article=Sur les aspects militaires du dieu ombrien Fisus Sancius |title=Melanges de l'Ecole Francais de Rome Antiquite |pages=134–137}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=135–137}}

The martial aspect of Sancus is highlighted also in the instance of the Samnite {{Lang|la|legio linteata}}, a selected part of the army formed by noble soldiers bound by a set of particularly compelling oaths and put under the special protection of Iupiter. While ordinary soldiers dressed in a purple red [[paludamentum]] with golden paraphernalia, those of the {{Lang|la|legio}} dressed in white with silver paraphernalia, as an apparent show of their different allegiance and protector. This strict association of the ritual to Iupiter underlines the military aspect of the sovereign god that comes in to supplement the usual role of Mars on special occasions, i.e. when there is the need for the support of his power.&lt;ref name=Briquel-1979/&gt;

A prodigy related by Livy concerning an {{Lang|la|avis sanqualis}} who broke a rainstone or meteorite fallen into a grove sacred to Mars at [[Crustumerium]] in 177&amp;nbsp;BCE has also been seen by some scholars as a sign of a martial aspect of Sancus. [[Roger D. Woodard|Woodard]]&lt;ref name=Woodard-2006/&gt; has  interpreted Sancus as the Roman equivalent of Vedic god [[Indra]], who has to rely on the help of the [[Maruts]], in his view corresponding to the twelfth Roman {{Lang|la|semones}} of the [[carmen Arvale]], in his task of killing the dragon [[Vrtra]] thus freeing the waters and averting draught. He traces the etymology of ''Semo'' to [[Indo-European languages|PIE]] root *{{Lang|mis|sh₂e(w)-}}&lt;!-- Indo-European --&gt; bearing the meanings of 'to pour', 'ladle', 'flow', 'drop' related to rain and sowing.&lt;ref name=Fowler-1899/&gt;{{rp|page=140}}&lt;ref name=Woodard-2006/&gt;{{rp|pages=186&amp;nbsp;ff}}
&lt;nowiki&gt; In Roman myth &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Hercules]] would represent this mythic character in his killing of the monster [[Cacus]]. Sancus would be identical to Hercules and strictly related, though not identical, to Mars as purported by the old cults of the [[Salii]] of [[Tibur]] related by Varro and other ancient authors cited by Macrobius. The tricephalous deity represented near Hercules in Etruscan tombs and reflected in the wise of the killing of [[Cacus]] would correspond to the features of the monster killed by Indra in association with Trita Āpya.&lt;ref&gt;
Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 12, 1-8
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Woodard-2006/&gt;{{rp|pages=220&amp;nbsp;ff}}

The connection between Sancus and Mars can be further explained by the fact that Semo Sancus could be considered identical with the god [[Enyalius]] son of Mars ([[Ares]]); but sometimes Enyalius served also as an epithet of Ares (Mars) himself thus the two came to be regarded as very similar in character and their identities could overlap at times. [[Pirro Ligorio]] in the ''Codice Torinese'' reports the tradition about this god (Sancus) as found in the city of [[Rieti]], populated by the Sabines and he writes as such: "[…] Hoggidì questa città chiamano Rieti, et delle sue antichità si trova questa base rotonda nel mezzo della sua piazza, sopra la quale fu già la statua di Sancte Sabinorum che è il Genio detto Sango et alcuni il chiamano Genio altri Enialio figliuolo di Marte, alcuni vogliono che sia Hercole, altri Apolline […]" which translates as: "Nowadays they call this city Rieti, and of its ancient artifacts this rounded base can be found in the center of its square, on top of which there was the statue of Sancte Sabinorum who is the Genius called Sangus and some call him Genius others Enyalios son of Mars, some claim he is Hercules, others [[Apollo]] […]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.persee.fr/doc/mefr_0223-5102_1985_num_97_1_5501&lt;br&gt;L'Ara di Lucius Munius a Rieti (article), Monika Verzar Bass – Mélanges de l'école française de Rome, Year: 1985 / 97-1  / pp. 295-323.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sancus in Etruria==
As for Etruscan religion, N. Thomas De Grummond has suggested to identify Sancus in the inscription {{Lang|la|Selvans Sanchuneta}} found on a {{Lang|la|[[cippus]]}} unearthed near Bolsena; however, other scholars connect this epithet to a local family {{Lang|la|gentilicium}}.&lt;ref&gt;N. T. De Grummond ''Etruscan Myth Sacred History and Legend''  2006 p. 141; Peter F. Dorcey ''The Cult of Silvanus: a Study in Roman Folk Religion'' Brill Leyden 1992 p. 11 citing C. De Simone ''Etrusco Sanchuneta'' ''La Parola del Passato'' '''39''' (1984) pp. 49-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The theonym {{Lang|la|Tec Sans}} found on bronze statues (one of a boy and that of the {{Lang|la|arringatore}}, 'public speaker') from the area near [[Cortona]] has been seen as an Etruscan form of the same theonym.&lt;ref name=Palmer-1994/&gt;{{rp|pages=17 ff}}

'''Silvanus''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɪ|l|ˈ|v|eɪ|n|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/silvanus?showCookiePolicy=true|title=Silvanus or Sylvanus
|access-date=24 September 2014|publisher=Collins Dictionary|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "of the woods" in [[Latin]]) was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[tutelary deity]] of woods and uncultivated lands. As protector of the forest (''sylvestris deus''), he especially presided over plantations and delighted in trees growing wild.&lt;ref name="Tibullus"&gt;[[Tibullus]] II.5.27, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucan"&gt;[[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]]. ''[[Pharsalia]]'' III.402.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pliny"&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]]. ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis historia]]'' XII.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]]. ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' I.193.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also described as a god watching over the fields and husbandmen, protecting in particular the boundaries of fields.&lt;ref name="Epodes"&gt;[[Horace]]. ''[[Epodes (Horace)|Epodes]]'' II.21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The similarly named [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] deity [[Selvans]] may be a borrowing of Silvanus,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "Silvanus," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 146 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uf2_kHAs22sC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=%22borrowed+from+the+Latin%22+%22Etruscan+Selvans%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WgHcTLLtE8fOnAe5npkX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22borrowed%20from%20the%20Latin%22%20%22Etruscan%20Selvans%22&amp;f=false online], concurring with [[Dumézil]], ''Archaic Roman Religion'', p. 616.&lt;/ref&gt; or not even related in origin.&lt;ref name="selvans"&gt;Peter F. Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus: A Study in Roman Folk Religion'' (Brill, 1992), pp. 10–12 [https://books.google.com/books?id=1YzWMQecwH4C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22A+popular+theory+traces+Silvanus+back+to+the+Etruscan+divinity+Selvans%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RhfcTKbpOIrfnQfb1LUW&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20popular%20theory%20traces%20Silvanus%20back%20to%20the%20Etruscan%20divinity%20Selvans%22&amp;f=false online], noting earlier efforts to press an [[Etruscan language|Etruscan etymology]] on Silvanus.&lt;/ref&gt;

Silvanus is described as the divinity protecting the flocks of cattle, warding off wolves, and promoting their fertility.&lt;ref name="Tibullus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VirgilVIII"&gt;Virgil. ''Aeneid'' VIII.600-1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cato"&gt;[[Cato the Elder]]. ''De Re Rustica'' 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]] II.324.&lt;/ref&gt; Dolabella, a rural engineer of whom only a few pages are known, states that Silvanus was the first to set up stones to mark the limits of fields, and that every estate had three ''Silvani:''&lt;ref&gt;Dolabella. ''ex libris Dolabellae,'' in "Die Schriften der rômischen Feldmesser", edited by Karl Lachmann, Georg Reimer ed., Berlin, 1848, p302&lt;/ref&gt;
* a ''Silvanus domesticus'' (in inscriptions called ''Silvanus [[Lares|Larum]]'' and ''Silvanus sanctus sacer Larum'')
* a ''Silvanus agrestis'' (also called ''salutaris'', literally "of the fields" or "saviour"), who was worshipped by shepherds, and
* a ''Silvanus orientalis'', literally "of the east", that is, the god presiding over the point at which an estate begins.
Hence ''Silvani'' were often referred to in the plural.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Silvānus'' ({{IPA-la|s̠ɪɫ̪ˈwaː.nʊs̠|classical}}) is a derivation from [[Latin]] ''silva'' ('forest, wood'). It is [[cognate]] with the Latin words ''silvester'' ('wild, not cultivated'), ''silvicola'' ('inhabiting woodlands') or ''silvaticus'' ('of woodlands or scrub'). The etymology of ''silva'' is unclear.{{Sfn|de Vaan|2008|p=564}}

==Attributes and associations==

Like other gods of woods and flocks, Silvanus is described as fond of music; the [[Pan flute|syrinx]] was sacred to him,&lt;ref name="Tibullus"/&gt; and he is mentioned along with the Pans and Nymphs.&lt;ref name="Lucan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgics"/&gt; Later speculators even identified Silvanus with [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], [[Faunus]], [[Inuus]] and [[Aegipan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]]. ''[[Parallel Lives]].'' Min. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He must have been associated with the Italian [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], for [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] refers to him consistently as ''Mars Silvanus''.&lt;ref name="Cato"/&gt; These references to Silvanus as an aspect of Mars combined with his association with forests and glades, give context to the worship of Silvanus as the giver of the art (techne) of forest warfare. In particular the initiation rituals of the [[evocatus|evocati]] appear to have referenced Silvanus as a protective god of raiding for women and cattle, perhaps preserving elements of earlier Etruscan worship. &lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]], ''Roman History'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/45*.html#12 45.12]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the provinces outside of Italy, Silvanus was identified with numerous native gods:&lt;ref&gt;Peter F. Dorcey (1992). ''The Cult of Silvanus: A Study in Roman Folk Religion,'' p.32. {{ISBN|978-90-04-09601-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xavier Delamarre]] suggests the epithet ''Callirius'' may be related to Breton theonym ''Riocalat(is)'' (attested in Cumberland Quarries), and both mean "(God) With Wild Horses".&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre, Xavier. "Affranchis, chevaux sauvages, libérateurs et mercenaires: le mot gaulois pour «libre»". In: ''Etudes Celtiques'', vol. 41, 2015. pp. 131 and 133.

==Worship==
[[File: Head of Silvanus crowned with pine, Centrale Montemartini, Rome (21952718528).jpg|thumb|Head of Silvanus crowned with pine, Centrale Montemartini, Rome.]]

The sacrifices offered to Silvanus consisted of grapes, ears of grain, milk, meat, wine and pigs.&lt;ref name="Tibullus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Epodes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horace. ''Epistles'' II.1.143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Juvenal"&gt;[[Juvenal]]. VI.446, with associated scholia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare Voss. ''Mythol. Briefe,'' 2.68; Hartung, ''Die Relig. der Röm.'' vol. 2. p. 170, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cato the Elder|Cato]]'s ''[[De Agricultura]]'' an offering to ''Mars Silvanus'' is described, to ensure the health of [[cow|cattle]]; it is stated there that his connection with agriculture referred to only the labour performed by men, and that females were excluded from his worship.&lt;ref name="Cato"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Juvenal"/&gt; (Compare [[Bona Dea]] for a Roman deity from whose worship men were excluded.) [[Virgil]] relates that in the very earliest times the [[Tyrrhenians|Tyrrhenian]] [[Pelasgians]] had dedicated a grove and a festival to Silvanus.&lt;ref name="VirgilVIII"/&gt;

==In literature==
In works of Latin poetry and art, Silvanus always appears as an old man, but as cheerful and in love with [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]].&lt;ref name="Epodes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]]. ''[[Georgics]]'' II.494&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carmina"&gt;Horace. ''[[Odes (Horace)|Carmina]]'' III.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. ''Metamorphoses'' XIV.639.&lt;/ref&gt; Virgil represents him as carrying the trunk of a [[Cupressus sempervirens|cypress]] ({{lang-el|δενδροφόρος}}),&lt;ref name="Georgics"&gt;Virgil. ''Georgics'' I.20-1.&lt;/ref&gt; about which the following myth is told. Silvanus – or [[Apollo]] according to other versions&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]. ''Commentary on the Aeneid'' III.680.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. ''Metamorphoses'' X.106&lt;/ref&gt; – was in love with [[Cyparissus]], and once by accident killed a pet hind belonging to Cyparissus. The latter died of grief, and was metamorphosed into a cypress.&lt;ref&gt;Servius. ''Commentary on Virgil's Georgics'' I.20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Virgil. ''[[Eclogues]]'' X.26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Virgil. ''[[Aeneid]]'' III.680.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Edmund Spenser]]'s epic poem ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' (1590–96), Silvanus appears in Canto VI of Book I. His 'wyld woodgods' (Stanza 9) save the lost and frightened Lady Una from being molested by ''Sans loy'' and take her to him. They treat her as a Queen because of her great beauty. Spenser writes in Stanza 14:

:::So towards old ''Syluanus'' they did her bring;
:::Who with the noyse awaked, commeth out,
:::To weet the cause, his weake steps gouerning,
:::And aged limbs on Cypresse stadle stout,
:::And with an yvie twyne his wast is girt gud about.

'''Rediculus''' is an [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman divinity]]. His cult had a temple near the [[Porta Capena]], and a ''campus'' on the [[Appian Way]].

==Origins and nature ==
This divinity is probably one of [[Rome]]'s ''[[lares]]'', a protector-god of the city. He is said to have appeared to [[Hannibal]] as he was camped outside Rome in 211 B.C., urging him to return (''redire'') to [[Carthage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mythindex.com/roman-mythology/R/Rediculus.html|title=Rediculus|work=Myth Index|year=2008|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGY1Sqjwf8kC&amp;pg=PA301|page=301|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|first=Lesley|last=Adkins|author2=Roy A. Adkins |year=2004|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816074822}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Festus (historian)|Festus]]' account of the incident reports that Hannibal, nearing the city, saw apparitions in the air, filling him with dread and causing him to turn back immediately:&lt;ref name="sale"&gt;{{cite book|title=An Universal History|volume=XII|location=London|publisher=T. Osborne|year=1747|pages=299–300|last=Sale|first=George|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PBBMLxM1pIwC&amp;pg=PA300|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Rediculi fanum extra portam Capenam fuit, quia accedens ad Urbem Hannibal ex eo loco redierit quibusdam perterritus visis.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/romanelegiacpoe01harrgoog|title=The Roman Elegiac Poets|first=Karl Pomeroy|last=Harrington|page=[https://archive.org/details/romanelegiacpoe01harrgoog/page/n284 278]|publisher=Anthem Classics|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [temple] of Rediculus was [outside] the Porta Capena; it was so called because Hannibal, when on the march from Capua, turned back at that spot, being alarmed at certain portentous visions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDwZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA525|page=525|title=The Natural History of Pliny|first=Bostock|last=John|author-link=John Bostock (physician)|author2=Henry Thomas Riley|author2-link=Henry Thomas Riley|volume=2|year=1855|publisher=Henry G. Bohn|location=London|isbn=9780598910769}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One account has the god's entreaty taking the form of a shower of [[hail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ta5o_ZQPocC&amp;pg=PA387|page=387|title=Rome in the Nineteenth Century|last=Eaton|first=Charlotte|author-link=Charlotte Anne Eaton|volume=I|location=London|publisher=George Bell &amp; Sons|year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hannibal's retreat, the Romans erected an altar at the site to "Rediculus Tutanus", the god "who turned back and protected".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Rome|volume=II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zZoWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA202|page=202|first=Theodor|last=Mommsen|year=1873|editor=William P. Dickson|publisher=Scribner, Armstrong, &amp; Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others{{Who|date=January 2021}} derive the name of the god from the word ''ridiculus'', signifying a thing to be laughed at.&lt;ref name="sale"/&gt; Hannibal's failure to enter Rome made him an object of scorn for the Romans, and in order to perpetuate his shame, they erected a temple to the god of laughter. [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] gives the god the epithet ''Tutanus'' (protector), having him speak in his ''Saturae Menippeae'' (''Hercules tuam fidem'', XXXIX):

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Noctu Hannibalis cum fugavi exercitum,&lt;br&gt;Tutanus hoc, Tutanus Romae nuncupor.&lt;br&gt;Hoc propter omnes, qui laborant, invocant.''

When in the night great Hannibal I beat,&lt;br&gt;And forc'd his troops from Latium to retreat,&lt;br&gt;From my defense, Tutanus was my name:&lt;br&gt;By this the wretched my protection claim.&lt;ref name="sale"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other authors, such as Robert Burn, say that this legend is "altogether unworthy of credit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/romecampagna00burn|page=[https://archive.org/details/romecampagna00burn/page/432 432]|last=Burn|first=Robert|title=Rome and the Campagna|location=Cambridge|publisher=Deighton, Bell and Co|year=1871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travelers leaving the city would pray at the temple before embarking on the Appian Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UsUJS9g6qHgC&amp;pg=PA156|page=156|title=The Murder of Regilla|last=Pomeroy|first=Sarah|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780674042209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temple and ''campus''==
The [[Tomb of Herodes and Regilla]], near the [[Church of Domine Quo Vadis]], has been confused with the Temple of Rediculus; the temple, however, is described by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] as having been on the opposite side of the Appian Way.&lt;ref name="hare"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/walksinromeincl00haregoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/walksinromeincl00haregoog/page/n313 291]|title=Walks in Rome|first=Augustus|last=Hare|edition=17|location=London|publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Truebner &amp; Co|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was dedicated in about A.D. 65.&lt;ref name="hare"/&gt;

There was a tomb in the ''campus Rediculi'' ({{lang-en|field of Rediculus}}) dedicated to a talking crow. [[Pliny the Elder]] gives the story in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (Book X, chapter 60):&lt;ref name="hare"/&gt; A cobbler had a stall in the [[Roman Forum]] and possessed a tame crow who, being a favorite among the younger Romans, eventually became a sort of public character. When it was killed by a rival of the cobbler, they executed the rival and gave the bird a public funeral, carrying it on a bier to its burial place in the field of Rediculus.&lt;ref name="hare"/&gt;

[[Image:Jupiter Tonans.jpg|thumb|''Iuppiter Tonans'', possibly reflecting the cult image of the temple of [[Jupiter Tonans]] ([[Museo del Prado|Prado]])]]
The numerous '''epithets of Jupiter''' indicate the importance and variety of the god's cult in [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]].

==Capitoline cult==
Jupiter's most ancient attested forms of cult are those of the state. The most important of his sanctuaries in Rome were located on the [[Capitoline Hill]] ''(Mons Capitolinus)'', earlier ''Tarpeius''. The Mount had two peaks, each devoted to acts of cult related to Jupiter. The northern and higher peak was the citadel ''([[Arx (Roman)|arx]]).'' On the ''arx'' was located the observation place of the [[augurs]] (the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#auguraculum|auguraculum]])'', to which the monthly procession of the ''sacra Idulia'' was directed.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa p. 108 citing Varro LL V 47and Festus p. 290 M. s.v. Idulia.&lt;/ref&gt; On the southern peak was the most ancient sanctuary of the god, traditionally said to have been built by [[Romulus]]: this was the [[Temple of Jupiter Feretrius]], which was restored by [[Augustus]]. The god here had no image and was represented by the sacred flintstone (''silex'').&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa p. 108 citing Paulus p. 92 M.; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' VIII 641.&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient known rites, those of the ''[[spolia opima]]'' and of the [[fetials]], connect Jupiter with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and [[Quirinus]], and are dedicated to ''Iuppiter Feretrius'' or ''[[Iuppiter Lapis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa p. 108 citing Festus p. 189 M. s.v. lapis; Polybius ''Historiae'' III 25, 6. According to Wissowa and Dumézil, ''Iuppiter Lapis'' seems to be inseparable from ''Iuppiter Feretrius'', in whose tiny shrine on the Capitol the ''silex'' was lodged.&lt;/ref&gt; From this earliest period, the concept of the [[sky god]] encompassed the ethical and political domain.

''Juppiter Tonans'' ("Thundering Jove") was the aspect (''numen'') of Jupiter venerated in the '''Temple of Juppiter Tonans''', which was vowed in 26 BCE  by [[Augustus]] and dedicated in 22 on the [[Capitoline Hill]]; the Emperor had narrowly escaped being struck by lightning during the campaign in [[Cantabria]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Vita Augusti'' 29.91, etc. See Samuel Ball Platner and Thomas Ashby, ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome,'' (London: Oxford University Press) 1929. [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Aedes_Jovis_Tonantis.html On-line text])&lt;/ref&gt; An old temple in the [[Campus Martius]] had long been dedicated to Juppiter Fulgens. The original [[cult image]] installed in the sanctuary by its founder was by [[Leochares]],&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Pliny's Natural History]], 39.79&lt;/ref&gt; a Greek sculptor of the 4th century BCE. The sculpture at the [[Prado]] is considered to be a late 1st-century replacement commissioned by [[Domitian]]. The Baroque-era restoration of the arms gives Jupiter a baton-like scepter in his raised hand.

Among Jupiter's most ancient epithets is ''Lucetius'', interpreted as referring to light ''(lux, lucis)'', specifically sunlight, by ancient and some modern scholars such as Wissowa.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wissowa p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Carmen Saliare]]'', however, indicates that it refers to lightning.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ARR It. tr. Milan 1977 p. 167. The ''carmen Saliare'' has: "cume tonas Leucesie prai ted tremonti/ quot tibi etinei deis cum tonarem" ("When you thunder, oh God of light, they tremble before you! All gods beneath you have heard you thunder!")&lt;/ref&gt; To the same atmospheric complex belongs the epithet ''Elicius'': while the ancient erudites thought it was connected to lightning, it is in fact related to the opening of the reservoirs of rain, as is testified by the ceremony of the ''Nudipedalia'', meant to propitiate rainfall and devoted to Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Petronius ''Satyricon'' 44.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ritual of the ''[[lapis manalis]]'', the stone which was brought into the city through the [[Porta Capena]] and carried around in times of drought, which was named ''Aquaelicium''.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus  s. v. p. 94 L 2nd; p. 2  M; Tertullian ''Apologeticum'' 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early epithets connected with the atmospheric quality of Jupiter are ''Pluvius'', ''Imbricius'', ''Tempestas'', ''Tonitrualis'', ''tempestatium divinarum potens'', ''Serenator'', ''Serenus''&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius ''DeMundo'' 37; cf. ''Iuppiter Serenus'' CIL VI 431, 433,; XI  6312;  ''Iuppiter Pluvialis'' CIL XI 324.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Iuppiter Serenus'' has been recognized as an ''interpretatio'' of the Phocean god Ζευς Ούριος: F. Cenerini above  p. 104 citing Giancarlo Susini "Iuppiter Serenus e altri dei" in ''Epigraphica'' '''33''' 1971 p. 175-177.&lt;/ref&gt; and, referred to lightning, ''Fulgur'',&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius I 2, 5; CIL I 2nd  p. 331: sanctuary in the Campus Martius, dedicated on October 7 according to calendaries.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fulgur Fulmen'',&lt;ref&gt;CIL XII 1807.&lt;/ref&gt; later as nomen agentis  ''Fulgurator'', ''Fulminator'':&lt;ref&gt;CIL VI 377; III 821, 1596, 1677, 3593, 3594, 6342  cited by Wissowa above p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; the high antiquity of the cult is testified by the neutre form ''Fulgur'' and the use of the term for the ''bidental'', the lightningwell dug on the spot hit by a lightningbolt.&lt;ref&gt;Festus s. v. provorsum fulgur p. 229 M: "...; itaque Iovi Fulguri et Summano fit, quod diurna Iovis nocturna Summani fulgura habentur." as cited by Wissowa above p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture and war==
A group of epithets has been interpreted by Wissowa (and his followers) as a reflection of the agricultural or warring nature of the god, some of which are also in the list of eleven preserved by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;Augustine ''De civitate Dei'' (herafter CD) VII 11. ''Pecunia'' is tentatively included in this group by Wissowa above p. 105 n.  4. Cfr. Augustine CD VII 11 end and 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Frugifer'' CIL XII 336. Apuleius ''De Mundo'' 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The agricultural ones include ''Opitulus'', ''Almus'', ''Ruminus'', ''Frugifer'',  ''Farreus'',  ''Pecunia'', ''Dapalis'',&lt;ref&gt;Cato ''De Agri Cultura'' 132; Paulus s. v. p. 51 M.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Epulo''.&lt;ref&gt;CIL VI 3696.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine gives an explanation of the ones he lists which should reflect [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]'s: ''Opitulus'' because he brings ''opem'' (means, relief) to the needy, ''Almus'' because he nourishes everything, ''Ruminus'' because he nourishes  the living beings by breastfeeding them, ''Pecunia'' because everything belongs to him.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa above  p. 105  n. 4 understands ''Pecunia'' as protector and increaser of the flock.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumézil maintains the cult usage of these epithets is not documented and that the epithet ''Ruminus'', as Wissowa and Latte remarked, may not have the meaning given by Augustine but it should be understood as part of a series including  ''Rumina'', '' Ruminalis ficus'', ''Iuppiter Ruminus'', which bears the name of Rome itself with an Etruscan vocalism  preserved in inscriptions, series that would be preserved in the sacred language (cf. ''Rumach'' Etruscan for Roman). However many scholars have argued that the name of  Rome, ''Ruma'', meant in fact woman's breast.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Migliorini s.v. Roma in ''Enciclopedia Italiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti'' vol. XXIX p. 589; A. W. Schlegel ''Sämtliche Werke'' Leipzig 1847 XII p. 488; F. Kort ''Römische Geschichte'' Heidelberg 1843 p.32-3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diva Rumina]], as Augustine testifies in the cited passage, was the goddess of suckling babies: she was venerated near the ''ficus ruminalis'' and was offered only libations of milk.&lt;ref&gt;N. G. L. Hammond &amp; H. H. Scullard (Eds.) ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'' Oxford 1970 s. v. p. 940.&lt;/ref&gt; Here moreover Augustine cites the verses devoted to Jupiter by [[Quintus Valerius Soranus]],  while hypothesising ''Iuno'' (more adept in his view as a breastfeeder), i. e. Rumina instead of Ruminus, might be nothing else than  ''Iuppiter'': ''Iuppiter omnipotens regum rerumque deumque Progenitor genetrixque deum...''.

In Dumézil's opinion ''Farreus'' should be understood as related to the rite of the ''confarreatio'' the most sacred form of marriage, the name of which is due to the spelt cake eaten by the spouses, rather than surmising an agricultural quality of the god: the epithet means the god was the guarantor of the effects of the ceremony, to which the presence of his flamen is necessary and that he can interrupt with a clap of thunder.&lt;ref&gt;Servius IV 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

The epithet ''Dapalis'' is on the other hand connected to a rite described by Cato and mentioned by Festus.&lt;ref&gt;Cato ''De Agri Cultura'' 132; Festus s. v. daps, dapalis, dapaticum p. 177-8 L 2nd.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the sowing of autumn or spring the peasant offered a banquet of roast beef and a cup of wine to Jupiter; it is natural that on such occasions he would entreat the god who has power over the weather, however  Cato's  prayer is one of sheer offer and no request. The language suggests another attitude: Jupiter is invited to a banquet which is supposedly abundant and magnificent. The god is honoured as ''summus''. The peasant may hope he shall receive a benefit, but he does not say it. This interpretation  finds support in the analogous urban ceremony of  the ''epulum Iovis'', from which the god derives the epithet of  ''Epulo''  and which was a magnificent feast accompanied by flutes.&lt;ref&gt;''Epulo'' CIL VI 3696.&lt;/ref&gt;

Epithets related to warring are in Wissowa' s view  ''Iuppiter Feretrius'', ''Iuppiter Stator'', ''Iuppiter Victor'' and ''Iuppiter Invictus''.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa above p. 105-108.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Feretrius'' would be connected with war by the rite of the first type of  ''[[spolia opima]]'' which is in fact a dedication to the god of the arms of the defeated king of the enemy that happens whenever he has been killed by the king of Rome or his equivalent authority. Here too Dumézil notes the dedication has to do with being regal and not with war, since the rite is in fact the offer of the arms of a king by a king: a proof of such an assumption is provided by the fact that the arms of an enemy king captured by an officer or a common soldier were dedicated to Mars and Quirinus respectively.

''Iuppiter Stator'' was first attributed by tradition to Romulus, who pledged to build a [[Temple of Jupiter Stator (8th century BC)|temple]] in his honor in exchange for his almighty help at a critical moment in the final [[Battle of the Lacus Curtius|battle]] of the war with [[Titus Tatius|King Titus Tatius]] of the [[Sabines]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 12, 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[[Parallel Lives|Life of Romulus]]'' ch.8 pg.7&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil opines the action of Jupiter is not that of a god of war who wins through fighting: Jupiter acts by causing an inexplicable change in the morale of the fighters of the two sides. The same feature can be detected also in the certainly historical record of the battle of the third Samnite War in 294 BC, in which consul [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] vowed a temple to ''Iuppiter Stator'' if "Jupiter will stop the rout of the Roman army and if afterwards the Samnite legions shall be victoriously massacred...It looked as if the gods themselves had taken side with Romans, so much easily did the Roman arms succeed in prevailing...".&lt;ref&gt;Livy X 36, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil above It. tr. p. 174-5.&lt;/ref&gt; in a similar manner one can explain the epithet ''Victor'', whose cult was founded in 295 BC on the battlefield of [[Sentinum]] by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges (consul 292 BC)|Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges]] and who received another vow again in 293 by consul [[Lucius Papirius Cursor]] before a battle against the Samnite ''legio linteata''. Here too the religious meaning of the vow is in both cases  an appeal to the supreme god by the Roman chief at a time when as a chief  he needs divine help from the supreme god, even though for different reasons: Fabius had remained the only political and military responsible of the Roman State after the ''devotio'' of P. Decius Mus, Papirius had to face an enemy who had acted with impious rites and vows, i. e. was religiously reprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;Livy X 29, 12-17; ''nefando sacro, mixta hominum pecudumqur caedes'', "by an impious rite, a mixed slaughter of people and flock" 39, 16; 42, 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently Dario Sabbatucci has given a different interpretation of the meaning of ''Stator'' within the frame of his structuralist and dialectic vision of Roman calendar, identifying oppositions, tensions and equilibria: January is the month of [[Janus]], at the beginning of the year, in the uncertain time of winter (the most ancient calendar had only ten months, from March to December). In this month Janus deifies kingship and defies Jupiter. Moreover January sees also the presence of [[Veiovis]] who appears as an anti-Jupiter, of [[Carmenta]] who is the goddess of birth and like Janus has two opposed faces, ''Prorsa'' and ''Postvorta'' (also named [[Antevorta]] and [[Antevorta|Porrima]]), of [[Iuturna]], who as a gushing spring evokes the process of coming into being from non-being as the god of passage and change does. In this period the preeminence of Janus needs compensating on the Ides through the action of Jupiter ''Stator'', who plays the role of anti-Janus, i. e. of moderator of the action of Janus.&lt;ref&gt;Dario Sabbatucci above, as summarized in the review by Robert Turcan above p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jupiter outside Rome==

===Iuppiter Latiaris===
The cult of ''Iuppiter Latiaris'' was the most ancient known cult of the god: it was practiced since  very remote times on the top of the ''Mons Albanus'' on which the god was venerated as the high protector of the Latin League, which was under the hegemony of Alba Longa.

After the destruction of Alba  by king Tullus Hostilius the cult was forsaken.  The god manifested his discontent through  the prodigy of a rain of stones: the commission sent by the senate to inquire into it was also greeted by a rain of stones and heard  a loud  voice from the grove on the summit of the mount  requiring the Albans to perform the religious service to the god according to the rites of their country. In consequence of this event the Romans instituted a festival of nine days (''nundinae'').   However a plague ensued:  in the end Tullus Hostilius himself  was affected and lastly killed by the god with a lightning bolt.&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 31 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was reestablished on its primitive site by the last Roman king Tarquin the Proud under the leadership of Rome.

The ''[[feriae Latinae]]'', or ''[[Latiar]]'' as they were known originally,&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius  I 16.&lt;/ref&gt; were the common festival (''panegyris'') of the so-called Priscan Latins&lt;ref&gt;Festus s.v. prisci Latini p. : "the Latin towns that existed before the foundation of Rome".&lt;/ref&gt; and of the Albans.&lt;ref&gt;L. Schmitz  in W. Smith  ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' London 1875 s. v. Feriae p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt; Their restoration aimed at grounding Roman hegemony in this ancestral religious tradition of the Latins. The original cult was reinstated unchanged as is testified by some archaic features of the ritual: the exclusion of wine from the sacrifice&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Divinatione''  I 18; Dionysius Hal.  AR  IV  49, 3; Festus p. 212 L l. 30 f.;'' Scholiasta Bobiensis ad Ciceronis pro Plancio'' 23.&lt;/ref&gt; the offers of milk and cheese and the ritual use of rocking among the games. Rocking is one of the most ancient rites mimicking ascent to heaven and is very widespread. At the ''Latiar'' the rocking took place on a tree and the winner was of course the one who had swung the highest. This rite was said to have been instituted by the Albans to commemorate the disappearance of king [[Latinus]], in battle against [[Mezentius]] the king of [[Caere]]: the rite symbolized a search for him both on earth and in heaven. The rocking as well as the customary drinking of milk was also considered to commemorate and ritually reinstate infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Festus s.v. oscillantes p. 194 M; C. A. Lobeck ''Aglaophamus sive de theologiae mysticae Graecorum causis libri tres'' Königsberg 1829 p. 585.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans in the last form of the rite brought the sacrificial ox from Rome and every participant was bestowed a portion of the meat, rite known as ''carnem petere''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Pro Plancio'' 23; Varro LL VI 25; Pliny NH III 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Other games were held in every participant borough. In Rome a race of chariots (''quadrigae'') was held starting  from the Capitol: the winner drank a liquor made with absinthe.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny XXVII 45.&lt;/ref&gt; This competition has been compared to the Vedic rite of the [[vajapeya]]: in it seventeen chariots run a symbolic race which must be won by the king in order to allow him to drink a cup of ''madhu'', i. e. ''soma''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Alföldi ''Early Rome and the Latins'' Ann Arbor 1965  p. 33 n. 6 cited by O. de Cazanove above p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The feasting lasted for at least four days, possibly six according to [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Niebuhr]], one day for each of the six Latin and Alban ''decuriae''.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa above p. 109; L. Schmitz in ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' London 1875 s. v. Feriae p. 529: Niebuhr  ''History of Rome'' II p. 35 citing Livy V 42, Plutarch  ''Camillus'' 42.&lt;/ref&gt; According to different records 47 or 53 boroughs took part in the festival  (the listed names too differ  in Pliny  NH III 69 and Dionysius of Halicarnassus AR V 61). The ''Latiar'' became an important feature of Roman political life as they were ''[[feriae conceptivae]]'', i. e. their date varied each year: the consuls and the highest magistrates were required to attend shortly after the beginning of the administration. They could not start  campaigning before its end and if any part of the games had been neglected or performed improperly the ''Latiar'' had to be wholly repeated. The inscriptions from the imperial age record the festival back to the time of the [[decemvir]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa p. 110. CIL 2011–2022; XIV 2236–2248.&lt;/ref&gt;
Wissowa remarks the inner linkage of the temple of the Mons Albanus with that of the Capitol apparent in the common association with the rite of the [[Roman triumph|triumph]]:&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa above p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;  since 231 BC some triumphing commanders had triumphed  there first with the same legal features as in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Livy XLII 21, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iuppiter Arcanus===
''Arcanus'' was the epithet of one of  the Jupiters worshipped at [[Praeneste]].&lt;ref&gt;CIL XIV 2852, 2937, 2972. The other is Imperator Maximus: cfr. Jacqueline Champeux.&lt;/ref&gt; His theology and cult are strictly connected to that of the ''[[Fortuna]] Primigenia'' worshipped in the famous sanctuary there. He is the protector of the lots ''sortes''  stored in the ''arca'', whence his epithet.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Paulus s.v. arcanum p. 16 M.&lt;/ref&gt; G. Dumézil  attempted a purely Indoeuropean interpretation of the theology of Fortuna and of her relationship with Juppiter and Juno,&lt;ref&gt;For an exposition of  Dumézil's interpretation the reader is referred to article [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]].&lt;/ref&gt; other scholars see the subcessive accretion  of a Greek-Etruscan and then a later Greek influence on Fortuna and the theological structure underlying her relationship to Jupiter, i. .e. earlier the child and then the parent of Fortuna.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Gagé]] above p. 39-40;  J. Champeux ''Fortuna. Recherches sur le culte de la Fortune à Rome et dans le monde romain dés  origines à la mort de César. I: Fortune dans la religion archaïque'' Paris 1982 (as reviewed by John Schied, "Religion romaine , religion latine" in ''Revue  d' études latins'' 1985); "Sors Oraculi. Les oracles en Italie sous la République et  l'Empire" in '''MEFRA''' '''102''' 1990 1 p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacqueline Champeaux interprets the boy represented on the ''cista'' of the 3rd century BC from Praeneste, now at the [[Archaeological Museum of Villa Giulia]] in  Rome, as Jupiter ''puer''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Divinatione'' II 85.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''arcanus'': the image engraved on it represents a boy sitting in a cave, reading a lot inscribed on a tablet. This might be a mythic illustration of the working of the oracle, in which Jupiter is at one time the child (''puer'') who ritually draws the rods of the lots (here while deciphering one) and their keeper, ''arcanus''.

The ''sortes'' of Praeneste were inscribed on rods of chestnut wood: they had sprung out of earth fully inscribed when a certain Numerius Suffustius cut the earth open with his spade, under the indication of some dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero above I  34; II 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

A different interpretation of the epithet is directly connected to the word ''arx'', which designates the political, military and religious centre of ancient Italic towns. Thus Iuppiter Arcanus is the god  of the ''arx'' of Praeneste. This interpretation is supported by numerous inscriptions found on the area around the local ''arx'',  sited on the summit of Monte Ginestro (m. 752), which dominates the town. The wall in ''opus  polygonale'' climbed from the town to surround the ''arx'': epigraphs attest the cults of Iuppiter Arcanus&lt;ref&gt;CIL XIV  2852, 2937, 2972, 2981.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mars.&lt;ref&gt;CIL XIV 2895, 2918.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Marcattili ''Thesaurus Cultus et Rituum Antiquorum. Cult Places'' 
s. v. Arx. Paul Getty foundation 2007 p. 187 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iuppiter Appenninus===
The god was venerated in a sanctuary at the mountain pass between Umbria and Marche now named [[Scheggia Pass]], about eight miles North-East of Iguvium along the [[Via Flaminia]], on Mount Petrara.&lt;ref&gt;''Notiziario degli scavi archeologici'' 1877 p. 120-122; T. Ashby &amp; R. A. L. Fell "The Via Flaminia" in ''Journal of Roman Studies'' XI  1921 p. 125-190 map at p. 178 as cited by J. Champeaux below.&lt;/ref&gt; He had a famous oracle there which gave his ''responsa'' by means of ''sortes'' (lots). Its reputation was great during the Empire and it was consulted by emperor [[Aurelian]]. Dedications have been excavated on the place &lt;ref&gt;CIL XI  5803-4.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Algeria on the top of a hill near Philippeville.&lt;ref&gt;CIL III 12576 and VIII 7691.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Champeaux "Sors oraculi" in ''MEFRA'' '''102''' 1990 p.  276.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudian]] mentions the oracle in his description of the travel of [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] from Fanum Fortunae.&lt;ref&gt;Claudian VI consulatu Honorii Augusti 500-514. As cited by J. Champeaux above.&lt;/ref&gt;

As was the case for the sanctuary of ''Iuppiter Poeninus'' on the Great St. Bernard, the mountain pass held a religious significance as a point of communication between different geographic areas, a passage to a different and unknown world that required a religious protection for the traveller.

===Other Italic Jupiters===
Jupiter was worshipped also under the epithets of ''Imperator Maximus'' in Praeneste, ''Maius'' in [[Tusculum]],&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius  I 12, 17 who connects him to Roman [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]]; CIL XIV 216; ''Ephemeris Epigraphica''  VII 1276.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Praestes''  in [[Tibur]],&lt;ref&gt;CIL 3555; cf. ''Historia Augusta'' Maximinus et Balbinus V 3; in Rome ''Iuppiter Praestitus'' CIL III 4037,  ''Iuppiter praestabilis'' CIL IX 1498 and the ''Lares praestitites''.&lt;/ref&gt; '' Indiges'' at [[Lavinium]]&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 2, 6; Pliny NH III 56; Servius ''Aen.''

In Umbro-Oscan areas he was ''Iuve Grabovius'' in the Iguvine Tables, ''Iuppiter Cacunus'' (of the top of mountains, cf. Latin ''cacumen'' and ''Iuppiter Culminalis''), ''Iuppiter Liber'' (see section on ''Liber'' above), ''Diuve Regature'' in the [[Table of Agnone]] that Vetter interprets as ''Rigator'',&lt;ref&gt;Emil Vetter ''Handbuch der Italischen Dialekte'' I Heidelberg 1953 n. 147&lt;/ref&gt; he who irrigates, and Dumézil as ''Rector'', he who rules and ''Diuve Verehasus'' tentatively rendered by Vetter as ''Vergarius''.

There are related [[mythology|mythological]] figures named '''Porus''' or '''Poros''' ({{lang-grc|Πόρος}} "resource" or "plenty") in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[classical literature]].

In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', Porus was the personification of resourcefulness or expediency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Robert|last=Flacelière|date=2008|title=A Literary History of Greece|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DTiaFeEaCgEC&amp;dq|pages=275–276|isbn=0202362957}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was seduced by [[Penia]] (poverty) while drunk on more than his fill of nectar at [[Aphrodite]]'s birthday.  Penia gave birth to [[Eros (god)|Eros]] (love) from their union. Porus was the son of [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=John M. |title=Complete Works/Plato |date=1997 |publisher=Hackett Publishing Company |location=Indianapolis, IN |isbn=0-87220-349-2 |page=486}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the character Diotima, Eros is forever in need because of his mother, but forever pursuing because of his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Julius|last=Evola|date=1991|title=Eros and the Mysteries of Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zlAX8pSUHSkC&amp;pg|pages=57–59|isbn=0892813156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mark|last=Morford|date=1999|title=Classical Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecGXcMRAPXcC&amp;dq|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=133–134|isbn=0195143388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This figure exists in [[Roman mythology]] as well and is known as [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]],{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} in which Porus is the [[personification]] of [[:wikt:abundance|abundance]]. He is the maternal half-brother of [[Athena]].

'''Caelus''' or '''Coelus''' was a [[wikt:primal|primal]] [[List of Roman deities|god]] of the [[sky]] in [[Roman mythology|Roman myth]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|theology]], [[Roman art|iconography]], and [[Latin literature|literature]] (compare ''caelum'', the [[Latin]] word for "sky" or "the heaven", hence English "celestial"). The deity's name usually appears in [[grammatical gender|masculine grammatical form]] when he is conceived of as a male generative force.

==Identity==
The name of Caelus indicates that he was the [[interpretatio graeca|Roman counterpart]] of the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] ((Οὐρανός, ''Ouranos''), who was of major importance in the [[theogony|theogonies]] of the Greeks) and the Jewish god [[Yahweh]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Works attributed to Florus|Floro]], ''Epitome'' 1.40 (3.5.30): "The [[Judaism|Jews]] tried to defend [[Jerusalem]]; but he ''[Pompeius Magnus]'' entered this city also and saw that grand Holy of Holies of an impious people exposed, Caelum under a golden vine" ''(Hierosolymam defendere temptavere Iudaei; verum haec quoque et intravit et vidit illud grande inpiae gentis arcanum patens, sub aurea vite Caelum).'' Finbarr Barry Flood, ''The Great Mosque of Damascus: Studies on the Makings of an Umayyad Visual Culture'' (Brill, 2001), pp. 81 and 83 (note 118). El ''Oxford Latin Dictionary'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982, 1985 reprinting), p. 252, entry on ''caelum'', cita a Juvenal, Petronio, and Floro como ejemplos de ''Caelus'' o ''Caelum'' "with reference to [[Yahweh|Jehovah]]; also, to some symbolization of Jehovah."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varro]] couples him with [[Terra (mythology)|Terra]] (Earth) as [[List of Roman deities#Mater and Pater|''pater et mater'']] (father and mother), and says that they are "great deities" (''dei magni'') in the theology of the [[mystery religions|mysteries]] at [[Samothrace]].&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De lingua Latina'' 5.58.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Caelus is not known to have had a cult at Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Grimal, ''The Dictionary of Classical Mythology'' (Blackwell, 1986, 1996, originally published 1951 in French), pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; not all scholars consider him a Greek import given a Latin name; he has been associated with [[Summanus]], the god of nocturnal thunder, as "purely Roman."&lt;ref&gt;Marion Lawrence, "The Velletri Sarcophagus," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 69.3 (1965), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caelus begins to appear regularly in [[Augustus|Augustan]] art and in connection with the cult of [[Mithras]] during the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]]. [[Vitruvius]] includes him among celestial gods whose temple-buildings ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#aedes|aedes]])'' should be built open to the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Other gods for whom this ''aedes'' design was appropriate are [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Sol (Roman mythology)|Sol]] and [[Luna (Roman goddess)|Luna]]. [[Vitruvius]], ''[[De architectura]]'' 1.2.5; John E. Stambaugh, "The Functions of Roman Temples," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.16.1 (1978), p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; As a sky god, he became identified with Jupiter, as indicated by an [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|inscription]] that reads ''[[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Optimus Maximus]] Caelus Aeternus Iup&lt;pi&gt;ter''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 6.81.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genealogy==
According to [[Cicero]] and [[Hyginus]], Caelus was the son of [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]] and [[Dies (mythology)|Dies]] ("Day" or "Daylight").&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''De natura deorum'' 3.44, as cited by E.J. Kenney, ''Apuleius: Cupid and Psyche'' (Cambridge University Press, 1990, 2001), note to 6.6.4, p. 198; [[Hyginus]], preface. This is not the [[theogony]] that [[Hesiod]] presents.&lt;/ref&gt; Caelus and Dies were in this tradition the parents of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''De natura Deorum'' 3.56; also [[Arnobius]], ''Adversus Nationes'' 4.14.&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Diana (mythology)|Trivia]], Caelus was the father of the distinctively Roman god [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]], as well as of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] and [[Ops]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ennius]], ''Annales'' 27 (edition of Vahlen); Varro, as cited by [[Nonius Marcellus]], p. 197M; [[Cicero]], ''Timaeus'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/cicero_timaeus.html XI]; Arnobius, ''Adversus Nationes'' 2.71, 3.29.&lt;/ref&gt; Caelus was also the father of one of the three forms of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the other two fathers being Aether and Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius, ''Adversus Nationes'' 4.14.&lt;/ref&gt; In one tradition, Caelus was the father with [[Tellus (goddess)|Tellus]] of the [[Muses]], though this was probably a mere translation of ''Ouranos'' from a Greek source.&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius, ''Adversus Nationes'' 3.37, citing [[Mnaseas]] as his source.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myth and allegory==
Caelus substituted for Uranus in Latin versions of the myth of Saturn ([[Cronus]]) castrating his heavenly father, from whose severed genitals, cast upon the sea, the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] ([[Aphrodite]]) was born.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De nature Deorum''; Arnobius, ''Adversus Nationes'' 4.24.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''[[De Natura Deorum|On the Nature of the Gods]]'', Cicero presents a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[allegory]] of the myth in which the castration signifies "that the highest heavenly aether, that seed-fire which generates all things, did not require the equivalent of human genitals to proceed in its generative work."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De natura Deorum'' 2.64. [[Isidore of Seville]] says similarly that Saturn "cut off the genitalia of his father Caelus, because nothing is born in the heavens from seeds" (''Etymologies'' 9.11.32). Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433–1177'' (University Press of Florida, 1994), pp. 27 and 142.&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Macrobius]], the severing marks off [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] from fixed and measured [[Chronos|Time]] (Saturn) as determined by the revolving Heavens (Caelum). The ''semina rerum'' ("seeds" of things that exist physically) come from Caelum and are the elements which create the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.8.6–9; Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The divine spatial abstraction ''Caelum'' is a [[wikt:synonym|synonym]] for [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] as a [[metaphor]]ical heavenly abode of the divine, both identified with and distinguished from the [[Mount Olympus|mountain in ancient Greece]] named as the home of the gods. Varro says that the Greeks call Caelum (or Caelus) "Olympus."&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 7.20; likewise [[Isidore of Seville]], ''Etymologies'' 14.8.9. The noun ''Caelum'' appears in the [[accusative case]], which obscures any distinction between masculine and neuter. [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 6.268, says that "Olympus" is the name for both the Macedonian mountain and for ''caelum''. Citations and discussion by Michel Huhm, "Le mundus et le Comitium: Représentations symboliques de l'espace de la cité," ''Histoire urbaine'' 10 (2004), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; As a representation of space, Caelum is one of the components of the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#mundus|mundus]]'', the "world" or ''[[cosmos]]'', along with ''terra'' (earth), ''mare'' (sea), and ''aer'' (air).&lt;ref&gt;Servius, note to ''Aeneid'' 3.134; Huhm, "Le mundus et le Comitium," p. 53, notes 36 and 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work on the [[cosmology|cosmological]] systems of antiquity, the [[Renaissance in the Low Countries|Dutch Renaissance]] [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] [[Gerardus Vossius]] deals extensively with Caelus and his duality as both a god and a place that the other gods inhabit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerardus Vossius]], ''Idolatriae'' 3.59 [https://books.google.com/books?id=q7w_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq=Janus+Cerus+Macrobius+Caelum+OR+Caelus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=byf9TPvUEqiBnAfT4fzHCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online] ''et passim'', in ''Gerardi Joan. Vossii Operum'', vol. 5, ''De idololatria gentili''. See also Giovanni Santinello and [[Francesco Bottin]], ''Models of the History of Philosophy: From Its Origins in the Renaissance to the "Historia Philosophica"'' (Kluwer, 1993), vol. 1, pp. 222–235.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ante-Nicene Period|ante-Nicene Christian]] writer [[Lactantius]] routinely uses the Latin [[wikt:theonym|theonyms]] Caelus, Saturn, and Jupiter to refer to  the three divine [[Hypostasis (Neoplatonism)|hypostases]] of the [[Neoplatonic]] school of [[Plotinus]]: the First God (Caelus), Intellect (Saturn), and Soul, son of the Intelligible (Jupiter).&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth De Palma Digeser, "Religion, Law and the Roman Polity: The Era of the Great Persecution," in ''Religion and Law in Classical and Christian Rome'' (Franz Steiner, 2006), pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
It is generally though not universally agreed that Caelus is depicted on the [[muscle cuirass|cuirass]] of the ''[[Augustus of Prima Porta]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Jane Clark Reeder, "The Statue of Augustus from Prima Porta, the Underground Complex, and the Omen of the Gallina Alba," ''American Journal of Philology'' 118.1 (1997), p. 109; Charles Brian Rose, "The Parthians in Augustan Rome," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 109.1 (2005), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; at the very top above the four horses of the Sun god's ''[[quadriga]]''. He is a mature, bearded man who holds a cloak over his head so that it billows in the form of an arch, a conventional sign of deity ''([[velificatio]])'' that "recalls the vault of the [[firmament]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Galinsky]], ''Augustan Culture: An Interpretive Introduction'' (Princeton University Press, 1996), pp. 158 and 321.&lt;/ref&gt; He is balanced and paired with the personification of Earth at the bottom of the cuirass.&lt;ref&gt;Reeder, "The Statue of Augustus," p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; (These two figures have also been identified as Saturn and the [[Magna Mater]], to represent the new Saturnian "[[Golden Age]]" of Augustan ideology.)&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, ''Juppiter Optimus Maximus Saturnus Augustus'': Reeder, "The Statue of Augustus," p. 109 and 111.&lt;/ref&gt; On an altar of the [[Lares]] now held by the [[Vatican Museums|Vatican]], Caelus in his chariot appears along with [[Apollo]]-[[Sol (Roman mythology)|Sol]] above the figure of [[Augustus]].&lt;ref&gt;Reeder, "The Statue of Augustus," p. 103; [[Lily Ross Taylor]], "The Mother of the Lares," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 29.3 (1925), p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nocturnus and the ''templum''==
[[File:MC - Jahreszeitenaltar 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Mithraic altar (3rd-century AD) showing Caelus flanked by allegories of the Seasons ([[Carnuntum|Museum Carnuntinum]], Lower Austria)]]
As ''Caelus Nocturnus'', he was the god of the night-time, starry sky. In a passage from [[Plautus]], Nocturnus is regarded as the opposite of  [[Sol (Roman mythology)|Sol]], the Sun god.&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Amphytrion'' 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Nocturnus appears in several [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|inscriptions]] found in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Italy]], in the company of other deities who are found also in the [[cosmology|cosmological]] schema of [[Martianus Capella]], based on the Etruscan tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Including ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 3.1956 = ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 4887, 9753, 14243&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''CIL'' 5.4287 = ''ILS'' 4888, as cited and discussed by Mario Torelli, ''Studies in the Romanization of Italy'' (University of Alberta Press, 1995), pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#disciplina Etrusca|Etruscan discipline]] of divination, Caelus Nocturnus was placed in the sunless north opposite Sol to represent the polar extremities of the axis (see ''[[cardo]]''). This alignment was fundamental to the drawing of a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#templum|templum]]'' (sacred space) for the practice of [[augur]]y.&lt;ref&gt;Torelli, ''Studies'', p. 110. See also Huhm, "Le mundus et le Comitium," pp. 52–53, on the relation of ''templum'', ''mundus'', and ''caelum''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Mithraic syncretism==
The name ''Caelus'' occurs in dedicatory inscriptions in connection to the cult of [[Mithras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle= Uranus (god) |volume= 27 | page= 789; see lines five to seven |quote= The Roman Caelus (or Caelum) is ...not the name of a distinct national divinity...no evidence of the existence of a cult of Caelus...the worship of the sky being closely connected with that of Mithras.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mithraic Caelus is sometimes depicted [[allegory|allegorically]] as an eagle bending over the sphere of heaven marked with symbols of the planets or the [[zodiac]].&lt;ref&gt;Doro Levi, "Aion," ''Hesperia'' (1944), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; In a Mithraic context he is associated with [[Cautes]]&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Vermaseren, ''Mithraica I: The Mithraeum at S. Maria Capua Vetere'' (Brill, 1971), p. 14; Jaime Alvar, ''Romanising Oriental Gods: Myth, Salvation, and Ethics in the Cults of Cybele, Isis, and Mithras'', translated by Richard Gordon (Brill, 2008), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; and can appear as ''Caelus Aeternus'' ("Eternal Sky").&lt;ref&gt;R. Beck in response to I.P. Culianu, "L'«Ascension de l'Âme» dans les mystères et hors des mystères," in ''La Soteriologia dei culti orientali nell' impero romano'' (Brill, 1982), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; A form of [[Ahura-Mazda]] is invoked in Latin as ''Caelus Aeternus Iupiter''.&lt;ref&gt;Levi, "Aion," p. 302. This was the view also of [[Salomon Reinach]], ''Orpheus: A General History of Religions'', translated by Florence Simmonds (London: Heinemann, 1909), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The walls of some [[mithraeum|mithrea]] feature allegorical depictions of the cosmos with [[Oceanus]] and Caelus. The mithraeum of [[Dieburg]] represents the tripartite world with Caelus, Oceanus, and Tellus below [[Phaethon|Phaeton]]-Heliodromus.&lt;ref&gt;Vermaseren, ''Mithraica I'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish syncretism==
Some Roman writers used Caelus or Caelum&lt;ref&gt;The word does not appear in the [[nominative case]] in any of the passages, and so its intended gender cannot be distinguished; see above.&lt;/ref&gt; as a way to express the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[God in Judaism|god of Judaism]] ([[Yahweh]]). [[Juvenal]] identifies the [[God in Judaism|Jewish God]] with Caelus as the highest heaven ''(summum caelum)'', saying that [[Jews]] worship the ''[[numen]]'' of Caelus;&lt;ref&gt;[[Juvenal]], ''Satires'' 14.97; Peter Schäfer, ''Judeophobia: Attitudes toward the Jews in the Ancient World'' (Harvard University Press, 1997), pp. 41, 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Petronius]] uses similar language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Petronius]], frg. 37.2; Schäfer, ''Judeophobia'', pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florus]] has a passage describing the [[Kodesh Hakodashim|Holy of Holies]] in the [[Second Temple|Temple of Jerusalem]] as housing a "sky" ''(caelum)'' under a golden vine. A golden vine, perhaps the one mentioned, was sent by the [[Hasmonean]] king [[Aristobulus II|Aristobulus]] to [[Pompey the Great|Pompeius Magnus]] after his defeat of [[Jerusalem]], and was later displayed in the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Florus]], ''Epitome'' 1.40 (3.5.30): "The Jews tried to defend [[Jerusalem]]; but he ''[Pompeius Magnus]'' entered this city also and saw that grand Holy of Holies of an impious people exposed, Caelum under a golden vine" ''(Hierosolymam defendere temptavere Iudaei; verum haec quoque et intravit et vidit illud grande inpiae gentis arcanum patens, sub aurea vite Caelum).'' Finbarr Barry Flood, ''The Great Mosque of Damascus: Studies on the Makings of an Umayyad Visual Culture'' (Brill, 2001), pp. 81 and 83 (note 118). The ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982, 1985 reprinting), p. 252, entry on ''caelum'', cites Juvenal, Petronius, and Florus as examples of ''Caelus'' or ''Caelum'' "with reference to [[Jehovah]]; also, to some symbolization of Jehovah."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baker's oven Pompei.JPG|thumb|Ruin of a brick baker's oven from [[Pompeii]]]]

'''Lateranus''' is an [[List of Roman deities|ancient Roman]] [[tutelary deity|tutelary god]] of hearths ''(foci)'' and a [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]] of brick ovens, according to a satirical passage in the Christian writer [[Arnobius]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lateranus, as you say, is the god and genius of hearths, and received this name because men build that kind of fireplace of unbaked bricks. What then? if hearths were made of baked clay, or any other material whatever, will they have no genii? and will Lateranus, whoever he is, abandon his duty as guardian, because the kingdom which he possesses has not been formed of clay? And for what purpose, I ask, has that god received the charge of hearths? He runs about the kitchens of men, examining and discovering with what kinds of wood the heat in their fires is produced; he gives strength to earthen vessels, that they may not fly in pieces, overcome by the violence of the flames; he sees that the flavour of unspoilt dainties reaches the taste of the palate with their own pleasantness, and acts the part of a taster, and tries whether the sauces have been rightly prepared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnobius]], 4.6, as translated by A.H. Bryce and Hugh Campbell (Edinburgh, 1871).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The name ''Lateranus'' is based on the [[Latin]] stem meaning [[Roman brick|brick]], ''later-'', as in ''[[opus latericium]]'', a type of brickwork (compare also [[laterculus]]). No other ancient writer mentions this god. [[Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher|W.H. Roscher]] places Lateranus among the ''[[indigitamenta]]'', the list of deities maintained by Roman priests to assure that the correct divinity was invoked for rituals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher|W.H. Roscher]], ''Ausführliches Lexikon der griechischen und römischen Mythologie'' (Leipzig: Teubner, 1890–94), vol. 2, pt. 1, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''Inuus''' ({{IPA-la|ˈɪnuʊs|classical}}) was a god, or aspect of a god, who embodied [[sexual intercourse]]. The evidence for him as a distinct entity is scant. [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]] wrote that Inuus is an [[epithet]] of [[Faunus]] (Greek [[Pan (god)|Pan]]), named from his habit of intercourse with animals, based on the [[etymology]] of ''ineundum'', "a going in, penetration," from ''[[wikt:inire|inire]]'',&lt;ref&gt;See the [[infinitive]] form ''[[wiktionary:inire|inire]]''; ''ineundum'' is a [[gerund]].&lt;/ref&gt; "to enter" in the sexual sense.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurus Servius Honoratus]], note on ''[[Aeneid]]'' 6.775; Julian Ward Jones, Jr., ''An'' Aeneid'' Commentary of Mixed Type: The Glosses in Mss Harley 4946 and Ambrosianus G111 inf.'' (Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1996), pp. 24, 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for the god were '''Fatuus''' and '''Fatuclus''' (with a short ''a'').

[[Walter Friedrich Otto]] disputed the traditional etymology and derived ''Inuus'' instead from ''in-avos'', "friendly, beneficial" (cf. ''aveo'', "to be eager for, desire"), for the god's fructifying power.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Nell MacFarlane, "Isidore of Seville on the Pagan Gods (''Origines'' VIII. 11)," ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' 70 (1980), p. 36, citing Otto's entry on Faunus in ''[[Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft|PW]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lupercalia==
[[Livy]] is the sole source for identifying Inuus as the form of Faunus for whom the [[Lupercalia]] was celebrated: "naked young men would run around venerating [[Mount Lyceum|Lycaean]] Pan, whom the Romans then called Inuus, with [[Trickster|antics]] and lewd behavior."&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 1.5.2: ''nudi iuvenes Lycaeum Pana venerantes per lusum atque lasciuiam currerent, quem Romani deinde vocarunt Inuum.''&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Ovid]] does not name Inuus in his treatment of the Lupercalia, he may allude to his sexual action in explaining the mythological background of the festival. When [[Romulus]] complains that a low fertility rate has rendered the [[The Rape of the Sabine Women|abduction of the Sabine women]] pointless, [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], in her guise as the birth goddess [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]], offers an instruction: "Let the sacred goat go into the Italian matrons" (''Italidas matres … sacer hirtus inito'', with the verb ''inito'' a form of ''inire'').&lt;ref&gt;[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Historiography and Imagination: Eight Essays on Roman Culture'' (University of Exeter Press, 1994), p. 138, note 104, takes Juno's instruction as clear reference to Inuus.&lt;/ref&gt; The would-be mothers recoil from this advice, but an [[augur]], "recently arrived from [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] soil," offers a ritual dodge: a goat was killed, and its hide cut into strips for flagellating women who wished to conceive; thus the [[Etiology#Mythology|aetiology]] for the practice at the Lupercalia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], [[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]] 2.441ff.; Jane F. Gardner, ''Roman Myths'' (University of Texas Press, 1993), p. 77, noting that [[Juno Sospita]] wears a goatskin cloak.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rutilius Claudius Namatianus|Rutilius Namatianus]] offers a similar verbal play, ''Faunus init'' ("Faunus enters"), in pointing out a statue depicting the god at Castrum Inui ("Fort Inuus").&lt;ref&gt;[[Rutilius Claudius Namatianus|Rutilius]], ''De reditu suo'', line 232.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Wissowa]] rejected both the etymology and the identification of Inuus with Faunus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Wissowa]], ''Religion und Kultus der Römer'', 2nd ed., p. 211, as cited by [[J.G. Frazer]], ''The Golden Bough'', vol. 2, ''Adonis Attis Osiris'' (London, 1919), p. 234, note 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scant evidence for Inuus has not been a bar to elaborate scholarly conjecture, as [[William Warde Fowler]] noted  at the beginning of the 20th century in his classic work on [[Roman festivals]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 312, commenting with an atypical degree of disparagement that "Unger … has much to say about Inuus in the worst style of German pseudo-research"; G.F. Unger, "Die Lupercalen," ''Rheinische Museum'' 36 (1881) 50–86.&lt;/ref&gt; "It is quite plain," Fowler observed, "that the Roman of the literary age did not know who the god (of the Lupercalia) was."&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Festivals'', pp. 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Castrum Inui==
Servius's note on Inuus is prompted by the mention of ''Castrum Inui'' at ''[[Aeneid]]'' 6.775:&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Boyle and R.D. Woodard, ''Ovid: Fasti'' (Penguin Books, 2000), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Faunus Vienna Ma528.jpg|thumb|120px|left|A [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]] bust of Faunus]]
{{quote|This is one and the same as the town (''[[civitas]]'') in Italy which is called New Fort ''(Castrum Novum)''. [[Vergil]] says 'Fort Inuus' for the place, that is, 'Fort [[Pan (god)|Pan]]', who has a [[cult (religion)|cult]] there. He is called Inuus, however, in [[Latin]], Πάν ''(Pan)'' in [[ancient Greek language|Greek]]; also Ἐφιάλτης ([[Aloadae|Ephialtes]]), in Latin [[Incubus]]; likewise Faunus, and Fatuus, Fatuclus. He is called Inuus, however, from going around having sex everywhere with all the animals, hence he is also called Incubus.&lt;ref&gt;Servius, note on ''Aeneid'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+A.+6.775&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053  6.775]: ''una est in Italia civitas, quae castrum novum dicitur: de hac autem ait 'castrum Inui', id est Panos, qui illic colitur. Inuus autem latine appellatur, Graece: item Graece, latine Incubo: idem Faunus, idem Fatuus, Fatuclus. dicitur autem Inuus ab ineundo passim cum omnibus animalibus, unde et Incubo dicitur.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Castrum Novum is most likely [[Giulianova]] on the coast of [[Etruria]], but Servius seems to have erred in thinking that Castrum Inui, on the coast of [[Latium]], was the same town.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E.A. Palmer]], ''Roman Religion and Roman Empire'' (University of Pennsylvania, 1974), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutilius makes the same identification as Servius, but explains that there was a stone carving of Inuus over the gate of the town. This image, worn by time, showed horns on its "pastoral forehead", but the ancient name was no longer legible. Rutilius is noncommittal about its identity, "whether Pan exchanged [[Tyrrhenians|Tyrrhenian]] woodlands for [[Mainalo|Maenala]], or whether a resident Faunus enters ''(init)'' his paternal retreats," but proclaims that "as long as he revitalizes the seed of mortals with generous fertility, the god is imagined as more than usually predisposed to sex."&lt;ref&gt;Rutilius, ''De reditu suo'', 225–234; Dennis George, ''The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria'' (London, 1883, 3rd ed.) vol. 1, p. 297, note 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other associations==
The [[Christian apologist]] [[Arnobius]], in his extended debunking of traditional Roman deities, connects Inuus and [[Pales]] as guardians over flocks and herds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnobius]], ''Adversus Nationes'' 3.23.&lt;/ref&gt; The woodland god [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]] over time became identified with Faunus, and the unknown author of the ''[[Origo gentis romanae]]''&lt;ref&gt;At one time, [[Aurelius Victor]] was thought to be the author of the ''Origo gentis romanae''.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that many sources said that Faunus was the same as Silvanus, the god Inuus, and even Pan.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Origo gentis romanae]]'' 4.6; Peter F. Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus: A Study in Roman Folk Religion'' (Brill, 1992), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isidore of Seville]] identifies the ''Inui'', plural, with Pan, incubi, and the Gallic [[Dusios]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Isidore of Seville]], ''[[Etymologiae]]'' 8.11.103: ''Pilosi, qui Graece Panitae, Latine Incubi appellantur, sive Inui ab ineundo passim cum animalibus. Unde et Incubi dicuntur ab incumbendo, hoc est stuprando. Saepe enim inprobi existunt etiam mulieribus, et earum peragunt concubitum: quos daemones Galli Dusios vocant, quia adsidue hanc peragunt immunditiam''; Katherine Nell MacFarlane, "Isidore of Seville on the Pagan Gods (''Origines'' VIII. 11)," ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' 70 (1980), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diomedes Grammaticus]] makes a surprising etymological association: he says that the son of the war goddess [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]], Greek [[Enyo]] (Ἐνυώ), given in the [[genitive case|genitive]] as Ἐνυοῦς (Enuous), is imagined by the poets as goat-foot Inuus, "because in the manner of a goat he surmounts the mountaintops and difficult passes of the hills."&lt;ref&gt;[[Diomedes Grammaticus]], ''Ars Grammatica'' 1.475–476; [[T.P. Wiseman]], "The Minucii and Their Monument," in ''Imperium sine fine: T. Robert S. Broughton and the Roman Republic'' (Franz Steiner, 1996), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casuccini mirror==
An [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[bronze mirror]] from [[Chiusi]] (''ca.'' 300 BCE), the so-called Casuccini mirror, may depict Inuus. The scene on the back is a type known from at least four other mirrors, as well as [[Engraved gem|engraved Etruscan gems]] and [[Red-figure pottery|Attic red-figure vases]]. It depicts the oracular head of [[Orpheus]] ([[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] ''Urphe'') prophesying to a group of figures. Names are inscribed around the edge of the mirror, but because the figures are not labeled individually, the correlation is not unambiguous; moreover, the lettering is of disputed legibility in some names. There is general agreement, however, given the comparative evidence, that the five central figures are ''Umaele'', who seems to act as a [[Mediumship|medium]];  ''Euturpa'' (the [[Muse]] [[Euterpe]]), ''Inue'' (Inuus), ''Eraz'', and ''Aliunea'' or ''Alpunea'' ([[Palamedes (mythology)|Palamedes]] in other scenarios). The lovers in the pediment at the top are ''Atunis'' ([[Adonis]]) and the unknown ''E…ial'' where ''[[Turan (mythology)|Turan]]'' ([[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]) would be expected. The figure with outstretched wings on the tang is a ''[[Lares|Lasa]]'', an Etruscan form of [[Lares|Lar]] who was a facilitator of love like the [[Erotes]] or [[Cupid]].

The bearded Inuus appears in the center. Damage obscures his midsection and legs, but his left arm and chest are nude and muscled. On an otherwise very similar mirror, a spear-bearing youth replaces Inuus in the composition. No myth that would provide a narrative context for the scene has been determined.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Daniel De Puma and [[W. K. C. Guthrie]], "An Etruscan Mirror with the Prophesying Head of Orpheus," ''Record of the Art Museum, Princeton University'' 60 (2001) 19–29; Richard Daniel De Puma, ''Etruscan Mirrors'', Corpus Speculorum Etruscorum: U.S.A. 4: Northeastern Collections ("L'Erma" di Bretschneider, 2005), pp. 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Darwinian connection==
[[Charles Darwin]] used the [[Nomenclature#Scientific nomenclature|nomenclature]] ''Inuus ecaudatus'' in writing of the [[Barbary macaque]], now classified as ''Macaca sylvanus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles|authorlink1=Charles Darwin|last2=Watson|first2=James D.|authorlink2=James D. Watson|title=The Indelible Stamp: The Evolution of an Idea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LEWfWf0mUJIC&amp;pg=PA1132|year=2005|publisher=Running Press|isbn=978-0-7624-2136-7}}, p. 1132&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Kingsley]] wrote to Darwin in January 1862 speculating that certain mythological beings may represent cultural memories of creatures "intermediate between man &amp; the ape" who became extinct as a result of [[natural selection]]:
{{quote|I want now to bore you on another matter. This great gulf between the [[quadrumana]] &amp; man; &amp; the absence of any record of species intermediate between man &amp; the ape. It has come home to me with much force, that while ''we'' deny the existence of any such, the legends of most nations are full of them. [[Faun]]s, [[Satyr]]s, Inui, [[Elf|Elves]], [[Dwarf (mythology)|Dwarf]]s — we call them one minute mythological personages, the next conquered inferior races — &amp; ignore the broad fact, that they are always represented as more bestial than man, &amp; of violent sexual passion. … The Inuus of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|old Latins]] is obscure: but his name is from ''[[wikt:inire|inire]]'' — sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles|author-link=Charles Darwin|title=The Correspondence of Charles Darwin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5MqBgwX2vZIC&amp;pg=PA63|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59032-7}}, pp. 61–63&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Clitumnus''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|ᵻ|ˈ|t|ʌ|m|n|ə|s}}; {{Lang-lat|Clītumnus}}) was a son of [[Oceanus]] and [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]]. He was the god of the [[Clitunno River]] in [[Umbria]].

Reference to Clitumnus is best attested in [[Pliny the Younger]] "Letters" 8.8: "Hard by is an ancient and sacred temple, where stands Jupiter Clitumnus himself clad and adorned with a [[Toga#Varieties|toga praetexta]], and the oracular responses delivered there prove that the deity dwells within and foretells the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pliny |last2=Firth |first2=J.B.

The Roman Emperor [[Caligula]] visited the sacred grove prior to his invasion of Germany, presumably to consult the oracle of Clitumnus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hofmann |first1=Paul |title=A Fount of Poetic Inspiration |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/20/travel/a-fount-of-poetic-inspiration.html |accessdate=Mar 21, 2019 |agency=The New York Times |date=Sep 20, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Suetonius |title=Caligula 43 |url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Suet.%20Cal.%2043&amp;lang=original |accessdate=Mar 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermanubis''' ({{lang-grc|Ἑρμανοῦβις|translit=Hermanoubis}}) is a [[Greco-Egyptian|Graeco-Egyptian]] god who conducts the souls of the dead to the [[greek underworld|underworld]]. He is a [[syncretism]] of [[Hermes]] from [[Greek mythology]] and [[Anubis]] from [[Egyptian mythology]].

==Description==
[[File:Sousse_mosaic_calendar_November.JPG|thumb|Hermanubis in the November panel of a Roman mosaic calendar from Sousse, Tunisia.]]
Hermes' and Anubis's similar responsibilities (they were both [[psychopomp|conductors of souls]]) led to the god Hermanubis.  He was popular during the period of [[Roman Empire|Roman domination]] over [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=William |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6noOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA72 |title=A New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography Mythology and Geography Partly Based Upon the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology |date=1878 |publisher=Harper |pages=72 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depicted having a human body and a jackal head, with the sacred [[caduceus]] that belonged to the Greek god Hermes, he represented the Egyptian priesthood. He engaged in the investigation of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[De Iside et Osiride]]'' 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' i.18, 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Peck |first=Harry Thurston |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RacKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA799 |title=Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities |date=1897 |publisher=Harper |pages=799 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The divine name {{lang|grc|Ἑρμανοῦβις}} is known from a handful of epigraphic and literary sources, mostly of the Roman period. [[Plutarch]] cites the name as a designation of Anubis in his underworldly aspect, while [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] refers to Hermanubis as {{lang|grc|σύνθετος}} "composite" and {{lang|grc|μιξέλλην}} "half-Greek".&lt;ref&gt;[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], ''[[Porphyry_(philosopher)#Works_by_Porphyry|De imaginibus]]'' fr. 8, p. 18. 1–2 Bidez&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Budge |first=Sir Ernest Alfred Wallis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AqMUl7Knsz0C&amp;pg=PA493 |title=The Gods of the Egyptians: Or, Studies in Egyptian Mythology |date=1904 |publisher=Methuen &amp; Company |pages=493 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was not common in traditional [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]] to combine the names of two gods in this manner, the double determination of Hermanubis has some formal parallels in the earlier period. The most obvious is the god [[Hermaphroditus]], attested from the fourth century BC onwards, but his name implies the paradoxical union of two different gods (Hermes and [[Aphrodite]]) rather than an assimilation in the manner of Hermanubis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Benaissa |first=Amin |date=2010 |title=The Onomastic Evidence for the God Hermanubis |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.7523866.0025.116 |journal=The Proceedings of the 25th International Congress of Papyrology |volume=25 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
'''Mercury''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɜːr|k|j|ʊr|i}}; {{lang-la|Mercurius}} {{IPA-la|mɛrˈkʊrijʊs||La-cls-Mercurius.ogg}}) is a major god in [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] and [[Roman mythology|mythology]], being one of the 12 [[Dii Consentes]] within the ancient Roman [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]]. He is the god of financial gain, commerce, eloquence, messages, communication (including [[divination]]), travelers, boundaries, luck, trickery, and thieves; he also serves as the guide of souls to the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary to Ovid's Fasti, Penguin edition, by Boyle and Woodard at 343&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rupke, The Religion of the Romans, at 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In Roman mythology, he was considered to be either the son of [[Maia]], one of the [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|seven daughters]] of the [[Titans|Titan]] [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], or of [[Caelus]] and [[Dies (deity)|Dies]].&lt;ref name=parents&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In his earliest forms, he appears to have been related to the [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan deity]] [[Turms]]; both gods share characteristics with the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] [[Hermes]]. He is often depicted holding the [[caduceus]] in his left hand. Similar to his [[Interpretatio graeca|Greek equivalent]] Hermes, he was awarded a [[magic wand]] by [[Apollo]], which later turned into the caduceus, the staff with intertwined snakes.

==Etymology==
The name "Mercury" is possibly related to the Latin words ''{{Lang|lat|merx}}'' ("merchandise"; cf. ''merchant'', ''commerce'', etc.), ''{{Lang|lat|mercari}}'' (''to trade''), and ''{{Lang|lat|merces}}'' (''wages''); another possible connection is the Proto-Indo-European root merĝ- for "boundary, border" (cf. [[Old English]] "{{Lang|ang|mearc}}", [[Old Norse]] "{{Lang|non|mark}}" and Latin "{{Lang|lat|margō}}") and Greek {{Lang|ell|οὖρος|italic=no}} (by analogy of {{Transliteration|el|Arctūrus}}/{{Lang|ell|Ἀρκτοῦρος|italic=no}}), as the "keeper of boundaries," referring to his role as bridge between the upper and lower worlds.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==History==
Mercury did not appear among the {{Lang|lat|[[numinous]]}} ''{{Lang|lat|[[di indigetes]]}}'' of early [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]. Rather, he subsumed the earlier [[Dei Lucrii]] as Roman religion was [[syncretism|syncretized]] with [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]] during the time of the [[Roman Republic]], starting around the 4th century BC. His cult was introduced also by influence of [[Etruscan religion]] in which [[Turms]] had similar characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/turms_(Enciclopedia-dell%27-Arte-Antica)/ |title=TURMS in "Enciclopedia dell'Arte Antica" |last=Parise |first=N.F }} &lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, Mercury had essentially the same aspects as [[Hermes]], wearing winged shoes ([[talaria]]) and a winged hat ({{Transliteration|el|[[petasos]]}}), and carrying the [[caduceus]], a herald's staff with two entwined snakes that was [[Apollo]]'s gift to Hermes. He was often accompanied by a [[rooster]], herald of the new day,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://exploratorium.galloromeinsmuseum.be/Default.aspx?query=search=deeplink%7C/record/uniqid=obj_3631&amp;showtype=record Exploratorium: Beeldje van Mercurius]&lt;/ref&gt; a ram or goat, symbolizing [[fertility]], and a tortoise, referring to Mercury's legendary invention of the [[lyre]] from a tortoise shell.

Like Hermes, he was also a god of messages, eloquence and of trade, particularly of the [[grain trade]]. He was the patron of travelers and the god of thievery as well. Mercury was also considered a god of abundance and commercial success, particularly in [[Gaul]], where he was said to have been particularly revered.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, Gallic War, at 55&lt;/ref&gt; He was also, like Hermes, the Romans' [[psychopomp]], leading newly deceased souls to the afterlife. Additionally, [[Ovid]] wrote that Mercury carried [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]]' dreams from the valley of [[Somnus]] to sleeping humans.&lt;ref name="Littleton"&gt;Littleton, C. Scott (Ed.) (2002). ''Mythology: The Illustrated Anthology of World Myth and Storytelling'' (pp. 195, 251, 253, 258, 292). London: Duncan Baird Publishers. {{ISBN|1-904292-01-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archeological evidence from [[Pompeii]] suggests that Mercury was among the most popular of Roman gods.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, Pompeii: The Life of a Roman Town at 295–298&lt;/ref&gt; The god of commerce was depicted on two early bronze coins of the Roman Republic, the [[Sextans (coin)|sextans]] and the {{Lang|lat|[[semuncia]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sear, David R. (2000). ''Roman Coins and Their Values&amp;nbsp;– The Millennium Edition''. Volume I: The Republic and The Twelve Caesars, 280BC-AD96 (pp. 187–189). London: Spink. {{ISBN|1-902040-35-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syncretism==
When they described the gods of Celtic and Germanic tribes, rather than considering them separate deities, the Romans interpreted them as local manifestations or aspects of their own gods, a cultural trait called the ''{{Lang|lat|[[interpretatio romana]]}}''. Mercury, in particular, was reported as becoming extremely popular among the nations the [[Roman Empire]] conquered; [[Julius Caesar]] wrote of Mercury being the most popular god in Britain and Gaul, regarded as the inventor of all the arts.&lt;ref&gt;De Bello Gallico 6.17&lt;/ref&gt; This is probably because, in the Roman [[syncretism]], Mercury was equated with the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic god]] [[Lugus]], and in this aspect was commonly accompanied by the Celtic goddess [[Rosmerta]]. Although Lugus may originally have been a deity of light or the sun (though this is disputed), similar to the Roman Apollo, his importance as a god of trade made him more comparable to Mercury, and Apollo was instead equated with the Celtic deity [[Belenus]].&lt;ref name="Littleton"/&gt;

Romans associated Mercury with the [[Germanic paganism|Germanic god]] {{Lang|deu|[[Odin|Wotan]]}}, by ''{{Lang|lat|interpretatio romana}}''; 1st-century Roman writer [[Tacitus]] identifies him as the chief god of the Germanic peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Germania 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names and epithets==
Mercury is known to the Romans as {{Lang|lat|Mercurius}} and occasionally in earlier writings as {{Lang|lat|Merqurius, Mirqurios}} or ''{{Lang|lat|Mircurios}}'', had a number of [[epithets]] representing different aspects or roles, or representing syncretisms with non-Roman deities. The most common and significant of these epithets included the following:

*''Mercurius Artaios'', a syncretism of Mercury with the Celtic god [[Artaios]], a deity of bears and hunting who was worshiped at [[Beaucroissant|Beaucroissant, France]].&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green, Miranda J. (1992). ''Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend'' (pp. 148–149). London: [[Thames and Hudson]]. {{ISBN|0-500-01516-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Mercurius Arvernus'', a syncretism of the Celtic [[Arvernus]] with Mercury. Arvernus was worshiped in the [[Rhineland]], possibly as a particular deity of the [[Arverni|Arverni tribe]], though no dedications to Mercurius Arvernus occur in their territory in the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne region]] of central France.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;
*''[[Mercurius Cimbrianus]]'', a syncretism of Mercury with a god of the [[Cimbri]] sometimes thought to represent Odin.
*''Mercurius Cissonius'', a combination of Mercury with the Celtic god [[Cissonius]], who is written of in the area spanning from [[Cologne|Cologne, Germany]] to [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes, France]].&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;
*''Mercurius Esibraeus'', a syncretism of the [[Iberians|Iberian]] deity [[Esibraeus]] with the Roman deity Mercury. Esibraeus is mentioned only in an inscription found at [[Medelim]], Portugal, and is possibly the same deity as Banda Isibraiegus, who is invoked in an inscription from the nearby village of [[Bemposta (Abrantes)|Bemposta]].&lt;ref&gt;Alarcão, Jorge de (1988). ''Roman Portugal''. Volume I: Introduction (p. 93). Warminster: Aris and Phillips.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Mercurius Gebrinius'', a syncretism of Mercury with the Celtic or Germanic [[Gebrinius]], known from an inscription on an altar in [[Bonn|Bonn, Germany]].&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;
*''Mercurius Moccus'', from a Celtic god, [[Moccus]], who was equated with Mercury, known from evidence at [[Langres|Langres, France]]. The name Moccus ("pig") implies that this deity was connected to boar-hunting.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;
*''Mercurius Sobrius'' ("Mercury the Teetotaler"), a syncretism of Mercury with a [[Carthaginian (people)|Carthaginian]] god of commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Potter |first1=David |title=Review of "Rome and Carthage at Peace" by R.E.A.Palmer |url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1998/1998-08-02.html |journal=Bryn Mawr Classical Review |access-date=Feb 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Mercurius Visucius'', a syncretism of the Celtic god [[Visucius]] with the Roman god Mercury, attested in an inscription from [[Stuttgart|Stuttgart, Germany]]. Visucius was worshiped primarily in the frontier area of the empire in Gaul and Germany. Although he was primarily associated with Mercury, Visucius was also sometimes linked to the Roman god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], as a dedicatory inscription to "Mars Visucius" and Visucia, Visicius' female counterpart, was found in Gaul.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Espérandieu, E. (1931). ''Recueil Général des Bas-relief, Statues et Bustes de la Germanie Romaine''. Paris and Brussels.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ancient literature==
In [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', Mercury reminds [[Aeneas]] of his mission to found the city of Rome. In Ovid's ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', Mercury is assigned to escort the nymph [[Larunda]] to the underworld. Mercury, however, falls in love with Larunda and makes love to her on the way. Larunda thereby becomes mother to two children, referred to as the [[Lares]], invisible [[household god]]s.

==Temple==
[[Temple of Mercury|Mercury's temple in Rome]] was situated in the [[Circus Maximus]], between the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] and [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] Hills, and was built in 495 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#21|2:21]]&lt;/ref&gt;

That year saw disturbances at Rome between the patrician [[Roman Senate|senators]] and the [[Plebs|plebeians]], which led to a [[First secessio plebis in 494 BC|secession of the plebs]] in the following year. At the completion of its construction, a dispute emerged between the consuls [[Appius Claudius Sabinus Regillensis]] and [[Publius Servilius Priscus Structus]] as to which of them should have the honour of dedicating the temple.

The senate referred the decision to the popular assembly, and also decreed that whichever was chosen should also exercise additional duties, including presiding over the markets, establish a merchants' guild, and exercising the functions of the {{Lang|lat|[[pontifex maximus]]}}. The people, because of the ongoing public discord, and in order to spite the senate and the [[Roman consul|consuls]], instead awarded the honour of dedicating the temple to Marcus Laetorius, the [[Primus pilus|senior military officer]] of one of the legions. The senate and the consuls, in particular the conservative Appius, were outraged at this decision, and it inflamed the ongoing situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Livy]] |title=[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri|Ab urbe condita]] |at=[[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#27|2.27]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dedication occurred on 15 May, 495 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Livy]] |title=[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri|Ab urbe condita]] |at=[[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#21|2.21]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple was regarded as a fitting place to worship a swift god of trade and travel, since it was a major center of commerce as well as a racetrack. Since it stood between the plebeian stronghold on the Aventine and the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] center on the Palatine, it also emphasized the role of Mercury as a [[mediation|mediator]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Worship==
Because Mercury was not one of the early deities surviving from the [[Roman Kingdom]], he was not assigned a ''{{Lang|lat|[[flamen]]}}'' (priest), but he did have his own major festival, on 15&amp;nbsp;May, the [[Mercuralia]]. During the Mercuralia, merchants sprinkled water from his sacred well near the [[Porta Capena]] on their heads.

==In popular culture==
{{seealso|Planets in astrology#Mercury}}

Mercury features in the first published comic book story of [[Jack Kirby]], ''Mercury in the 20th Century'', published in [[Red Raven Comics|''Red Raven Comics'']] 1, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Marvel Visionaries, Jack Kirby, Marvel Comics, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States' so-called [[Mercury dime]], issued from 1916 to 1945, actually features a Winged [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] and not the god Mercury, but despite wearing a [[Phrygian cap]] instead of a winged helm, the coin bears his name due to resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1916-1945 Mercury silver dime value |website=Coinflation |url=http://www.coinflation.com/coins/1916-1945-Silver-Mercury-Dime-Value.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercury is one of the playable gods in the [[Virtual camera system#Third-person_view|third-person]] [[multiplayer online battle arena]] game ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smitegame.com/gods/ |title=Gods |website=smitegame.com |access-date=7 December 2021 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Roman myth (minor)|259px}}
'''Lupercus''' or '''Lubercus''' or '''Luberkus''' was a god in [[Roman mythology]]. Lupercus was a protector of the farmers, [[harvest]]ing and packs of [[wild animals]]. Every year on 15 February in honor of him, the Romans held the [[Lupercalia]]. He was an ancient Italian god, worshipped by shepherds as the promoter of fertility in sheep and protector of flocks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology, Lupercus|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0104:entry=lupercus-bio-1|access-date=2022-02-22|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He helped the [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]] take care of [[Romulus and Remus]]; this is why [[Lupercalia]] was a celebration that helped pregnant women.

Lupercus is sometimes identified with the god [[Pan (god)|Pan]] in [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Roman god Faunus is a variation of Lupercus, also linked to the festival of Lupercalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Franklin|first=Alberta Mildred|date=1921|title=The Lupercalia|url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/FRALUP/6*.html|access-date=2022-02-22|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|pages=53–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of his [[Roman festivals|festivals]] were held in March, the month named for him ([[Martius (month)|Latin ''Martius'']]), and in October, which began the season for military campaigning and ended the season for farming.

Under the [[Hellenization|influence of Greek culture]], Mars was [[interpretatio graeca|identified with]] the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] [[Ares]],&lt;ref name=Lar&gt;''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[myth]]s were reinterpreted in [[Latin literature|Roman literature]] and [[Roman art|art]] under the name of Mars. The character and dignity of Mars differed in fundamental ways from that of his Greek counterpart, who is often treated with contempt and revulsion in [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Kurt A. Raaflaub, ''War and Peace in the Ancient World'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Mars's altar in the [[Campus Martius]], the area of Rome that took its name from him, was supposed to have been dedicated by [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]], the peace-loving semi-legendary second [[Kings of Rome|king of Rome]]; in Republican times it was a focus of electoral activities. [[Augustus]] shifted the focus of Mars' cult to within the [[pomerium]] (Rome's ritual boundary), and built a temple to Mars Ultor as a key religious feature of [[Forum of Augustus|his new forum]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rehak and John G. Younger, ''Imperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the Northern Campus Martius'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2006), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Ares, who was viewed primarily as a destructive and destabilizing force, Mars represented military power as a way [[Pax Romana|to secure peace]], and was a father ''(pater)'' of the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isidore of Seville]] calls Mars ''Romanae gentis auctorem'', the originator or founder of the Roman people as a ''[[gens]]'' (''Etymologiae'' 5.33.5).&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome's mythic [[genealogy]] and [[Founding of Rome|founding]], Mars fathered [[Romulus and Remus]] through his rape of [[Rhea Silvia]]. His love affair with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] symbolically reconciled two different traditions of Rome's founding; Venus was the divine mother of the hero [[Aeneas]], celebrated as the [[Trojan War|Trojan refugee]] who "founded" Rome several generations before Romulus laid out the city walls.

== Origin ==
The word ''Mārs'' (genitive ''Mārtis''),&lt;ref&gt;The [[classical Latin]] [[declension]] of the name is as follows: [[nominative]] and [[vocative case]], ''Mars''; [[genitive]], ''Martis''; [[accusative]], ''Martem''; [[dative]], ''Marti''; [[ablative]] ''Marte''.[http://www.slu.edu/colleges/AS/languages/classical/latin/tchmat/grammar/whprax/w7-d3-n.html]&lt;/ref&gt; which in [[Old Latin]] and poetic usage also appears as ''Māvors'' (''Māvortis''),&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'' VIII, 630&lt;/ref&gt; is cognate with [[Oscan language|Oscan]] ''Māmers'' (''Māmertos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzU3RIV2BWIC|title=Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|last=Mallory|first=J.

==Birth==
{{Ancient Roman religion}}
Like Ares who was the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Theogony'' p. 79 in the translation of Norman O. Brown (Bobbs-Merrill, 1953); 921 in the [[Loeb Classical Library]] [https://archive.org/details/hesiod00hesi &lt;!-- quote="she, mingling in love" Ares. --&gt; numbering];  ''[[Iliad]]'', 5.890–896.&lt;/ref&gt; Mars is usually considered to be the son of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]. In [[Ovid]]'s version of Mars' origin, he was the son of Juno alone. Jupiter had usurped the accepted function of women as mothers when he gave birth to [[Minerva]] directly from his forehead (or mind). Juno sought the advice of the goddess [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]] on how to do the same. Flora obtained a magic flower (Latin ''flos'', plural ''flores'', a [[grammatical gender|masculine word]]) and tested it on a [[wikt:heifer|heifer]] who became fecund at once. Flora ritually  plucked a flower, using her thumb, touched Juno's belly, and impregnated her. Juno withdrew to [[Thrace]] and the [[Sea of Marmara|shore of Marmara]] for the birth.&lt;ref name=Mars-birth&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/ovidsfasti00oviduoft#page/276/mode/2up 5.229–260]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ovid]] tells this story in the ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'', his long-form poetic work on the [[Roman calendar]].&lt;ref name=Mars-birth/&gt; It may explain why the [[Matronalia]], a festival celebrated by married women in honor of Juno as a [[Lucina (goddess)|goddess of childbirth]], occurred on the first day of Mars's month, which is also marked on a [[Chronography of 354|calendar from late antiquity]] as the birthday of Mars. In the earliest Roman calendar, March was the first month, and the god would have been born with the new year.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 35f., discusses this interpretation in order to question it.&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid is the only source for the story. He may be presenting a literary myth of his own invention, or an otherwise unknown [[Ancient peoples of Italy|archaic Italic]] tradition; either way, in choosing to include the story, he emphasizes that Mars was connected to plant life and was not alienated from female nurture.&lt;ref&gt;Carole E. Newlands, ''Playing with Time: Ovid and the Fasti'' (Cornell University Press, 1995), pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consort==
The [[wikt:consort|consort]] of Mars was [[Nerio]] or Neriene, "Valor." She represents the vital force ''(vis)'', power ''(potentia)'' and majesty ''(maiestas)'' of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]], ''Attic Nights'' 13.23. Gellius says the word ''Nerio'' or ''Nerienes'' is [[Sabine language|Sabine]] and is supposed to be the origin of the [[cognomen|name]] ''Nero'' as used by the [[Claudia gens|Claudian family]], who were [[Sabines|Sabine]] in origin. The Sabines themselves, Gellius says, thought the word was [[ancient Greek language|Greek]] in origin, from νεῦρα ''(neura)'', Latin ''nervi'', meaning the sinews and ligaments of the limbs.&lt;/ref&gt; Her name was regarded as [[Sabine language|Sabine]] in origin and is equivalent to Latin ''[[virtus (virtue)|virtus]],'' "manly virtue" (from ''vir'', "man").&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E.A. Palmer]], ''The Archaic Community of the Romans'' (Cambridge University Press, 1970, 2009), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 3rd century BCE, the comic playwright [[Plautus]] has a reference to Mars greeting Nerio, his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plautus]], ''Truculentus'' 515.&lt;/ref&gt; A source from [[late antiquity]] says that Mars and Neriene were celebrated together at a festival held on March 23.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johannes Lydus]], ''De mensibus'' 4.60 (42).&lt;/ref&gt; In the later [[Roman Empire]], Neriene came to be identified with [[Minerva]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pomponius Porphyrion|Porphyrion]], ''Commentum in Horatium Flaccum'', on ''Epistula'' II.2.209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nerio probably originates as a divine [[personification]] of Mars's power, as such [[abstraction]]s in Latin are generally [[grammatical gender|feminine]]. Her name appears with that of Mars in an archaic prayer [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#invocatio|invoking]] a series of abstract qualities, each paired with the name of a deity. The influence of [[Greek mythology]] and its [[Anthropotheism|anthropomorphic gods]] may have caused Roman writers to treat these pairs as "marriages."&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' (London, 1922), p. 150–154; Roger D. Woodard, ''Indo-European Sacred Space: Vedic and Roman Cult'' (University of Illinois Press, 2006), pp. 113–114; Gary Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War'' (University of California Press, 2005), p. 145. The prayer is recorded in the passage on Nerio in Aulus Gellius.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] disapprovingly gives Mars and the war goddess [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]] as an example of a divine couple who were also sister and brother.&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine]], ''De civitate Dei'' 6.10, citing Seneca; Fowler doubts the authority of the passage (''Religious Experience'', p. 166, note 16).&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===Venus and Mars===
[[File:Wall painting - Ares and Aphrodite - Pompeii (VII 2 23) - Napoli MAN 9249 - 03.jpg|thumb|left|Mars caresses Venus enthroned. Wall-painting in [[Pompeii]], c. 20 BC – 50s AD]]
The union of Venus and Mars held greater appeal for poets and philosophers, and the couple were a frequent subject of art. In Greek myth, the adultery of [[Ares]] and [[Aphrodite]] had been exposed to ridicule when her husband [[Hephaestus]] (whose Roman equivalent was [[Vulcanus|Vulcan]]) caught them in the act by means of a magical snare. Although not originally part of the Roman tradition, in 217 BCE Venus and Mars were presented as a complementary pair in the ''[[lectisternium]]'', a public banquet at which images of [[Di Consentes|twelve major gods]] of the Roman state were presented on couches as if present and participating.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "Venus," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scenes of Venus and Mars in [[Roman art]] often ignore the adulterous implications of their union, and take pleasure in the good-looking couple attended by [[Cupid]] or multiple Loves ''(amores)''. Some scenes may imply marriage,&lt;ref&gt;John R. Clarke, ''The Houses of Roman Italy, 100 B.C.–A.D. 250: Ritual, Space, and Decoration'' (University of California Press, 1991), pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt; and the relationship was romanticized in funerary or domestic art in which husbands and wives had themselves portrayed as the passionate divine couple.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Salah Nasrallah, ''Christian Responses to Roman Art and Architecture: The Second-Century Church amid the Spaces of Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 284–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The uniting of deities representing Love and War lent itself to [[allegory]], especially since the lovers were the parents of [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The Renaissance philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] notes that "only Venus dominates Mars, and he never dominates her".&lt;ref&gt;Ficino, ''On Love'', speech 5, chapter 8, as summarized in the entry on "Mars," ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Roman and Renaissance art, Mars is often shown disarmed and relaxed, or even sleeping, but the extramarital nature of their affair can also suggest that this peace is impermanent.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Mars" in ''The Classical Tradition,'' p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essential nature==
[[File:Campanian bowl with Mars and Venus.JPG|thumb|A relief depicting Mars and [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] on a [[black-slip]] bowl from [[Campania]], Italy, 250–150 BCE, [[British Museum]]]]
[[Virility]] as a kind of life force ''(vis)'' or virtue ''(virtus)'' is an essential characteristic of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Onians, ''The Origins of European Thought about the Body, the Mind, the Soul, the World, Time and Fate'' (Cambridge University Press, 1951), pp. 470–471. Onians connects the name of Mars to the Latin ''mas, maris'', "male" (p. 178), as had Isidore of Seville, saying that the month of March ''(Martius)'' was named after Mars "because at that time all living things are stirred toward virility (''mas'', gen. ''maris'') and to the pleasures of sexual intercourse" ''(eo tempore cuncta animantia agantur ad marem et ad concumbendi voluptatem)'': ''Etymologies'' 5.33.5, translation by Stephen A. Barney, ''The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 128. In antiquity, ''vis'' was thought to be related etymologically to ''vita'', "life." Varro (''De lingua latina'' 5.64, quoting [[Gaius Lucilius|Lucilius]]) notes that ''vis'' is ''vita'': "''vis'' drives us to do everything."&lt;/ref&gt; As an agricultural guardian, he directs his energies toward creating conditions that allow crops to grow, which may include warding off hostile forces of nature.&lt;ref&gt;On the relation of Mars's warrior aspect to his agricultural functions with respect to Dumézil's [[Trifunctional hypothesis]], see Wouter W. Belier, ''Decayed Gods: Origin and Development of Georges Dumézil's 'idéologie tripartie' '' (Brill, 1991), pp. 88–91 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hs3BpWur0_4C&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=%22Besides+the+obviously+warlike+aspects+of+Mars+there+are+also+features+which+have+an+agricultural+aspect%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uU3wTNcEyeydB42G2OAK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Besides%20the%20obviously%20warlike%20aspects%20of%20Mars%20there%20are%20also%20features%20which%20have%20an%20agricultural%20aspect%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The priesthood of the [[Arval Brethren|Arval Brothers]] called on Mars to drive off  "rust" ''(lues)'', with its double meaning of [[Wheat leaf rust|wheat fungus]] and the [[rust|red oxides]] that affect metal, a threat to both iron farm implements and weaponry. In the [[Carmen Arvale|surviving text of their hymn]], the Arval Brothers invoked Mars as ''ferus'', "savage" or "feral" like a wild animal.&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, "Mars," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'', p. 135; Palmer, ''Archaic Community'', pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mars's potential for savagery is expressed in his obscure connections to the wild woodlands, and he may even have originated as a god of the wild, beyond the boundaries set by humans, and thus a force to be [[wikt:propitiate|propitiated]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome'' (University of California Press, 2005), p. 127; Fowler, ''Religious Experience'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[De Agri Cultura|book on farming]], [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] invokes ''[[#Mars Silvanus|Mars Silvanus]]'' for a ritual to be carried out ''in silva'', in the woods, an uncultivated place that if not held within bounds can threaten to overtake the fields needed for crops.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cato the Elder|Cato]], ''On Agriculture'' 141. In pre-modern agricultural societies, encroaching woodland or wild growth was a real threat to the food supply, since clearing land for cultivation required intense manual labor with minimal tools and little or no large-scale machinery. Fowler says of Mars, "As he was not localised either on the farm or in the city, I prefer to think that he was originally conceived as a Power outside the boundary in each case, but for that very reason all the more to be propitiated by the settlers within it" (''Religious Experience'', p. 142).&lt;/ref&gt; Mars's character as an agricultural god may derive solely from his role as a defender and protector,&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, "Mars," p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; or may be inseparable from his warrior nature,&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', ''Religions of Rome: A History'', pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; as the leaping of his armed priests the [[Salii]] was meant to quicken the growth of crops.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome'', p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that Mars was originally a thunderer or storm deity, which explains some of his mixed traits in regards to fertility.&lt;ref name="York, Michael 1988"/&gt; This role was later taken in the Roman pantheon by several other gods, such as [[Summanus]] or [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].

==Sacred animals==
[[File:Altar Mars Venus Massimo lupa.jpg|thumb|[[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|She-wolf]] and twins [[Romulus and Remus]] from an altar to Venus and Mars]]
The wild animals most sacred to Mars were the woodpecker, the wolf, and the bear, which in the natural lore of the Romans were said always to inhabit the same foothills and woodlands.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Roman Questions'' 21, citing [[Nigidius Figulus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] notes that the woodpecker ''(picus)'' is sacred to Mars because "it is a courageous and spirited bird and has a [[beak]] so strong that it can overturn oaks by pecking them until it has reached the inmost part of the tree."&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Roman Questions'' 21; also named as sacred to Mars in his ''Life of Romulus''. Ovid (''Fasti'' 3.37) calls the woodpecker the bird of Mars.&lt;/ref&gt; As the beak of the ''picus Martius'' contained the god's power to ward off harm, it was carried as a [[amulet|magic charm]] to prevent [[bee sting]]s and [[leech]] bites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 29.29.&lt;/ref&gt; The bird of Mars also guarded a woodland herb ''([[paeonia (plant)|paeonia]])'' used for treatment of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|digestive]] or [[Female reproductive system (human)|female reproductive systems]]; those who sought to harvest it were advised to do so by night, lest the woodpecker jab out their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 27.60. Pliny names the herb as ''glycysīdē'' in Greek, Latin ''[[paeonia (plant)|paeonia]]'' (see [[Peony#Name|Peony: Name]]), also called ''pentorobos''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''picus Martius'' seems to have been a particular species, but authorities differ on which one: perhaps ''[[Picus viridis]]''&lt;ref&gt;A.H. Krappe, "Picus Who Is Also Zeus," ''Mnemosyne'' 9.4 (1941), p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Dryocopus martius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Geoffrey Arnott]], ''Birds in the ancient world from A to Z'' (Routledge, 2007), p. 63 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0NB4qqenLQIC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=picus+Martius+Mars+%22green+woodpecker%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ifEITcboAYiWnAfq-KzaDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=picus%20Martius%20Mars%20%22green%20woodpecker%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The woodpecker was revered by the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin peoples]], who abstained from eating its flesh.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Roman Questions'' 21. [[Athenaeus]] lists the woodpecker among delicacies on Greek tables (''Deipnosophistae'' 9.369).&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the most important birds in Roman and Italic [[augur]]y, the practice of reading the will of the gods through watching the sky for signs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plautus]], ''Asinaria'' 259–261; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 10.18. Named also in the [[Iguvine Tables]] (6a, 1–7), as [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]] ''peiqu''; Schilling, "Roman Divination," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992), pp. 96–97 and 105, note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The mythological figure named [[Picus]] had powers of augury that he retained when he was transformed into a woodpecker; in one tradition, Picus was the son of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] 1.31; Peter F. Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus: A Study in Roman Folk Religion'' (Brill, 1992), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]] [[cognate]] ''peiqu'' also means "woodpecker," and the Italic [[Picentes|Picenes]] were supposed to have derived their name from the ''picus'' who served as their guide animal during a ritual migration ''([[ver sacrum]])'' undertaken as a rite of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;John Greppin, entry on "woodpecker," ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'' (Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997), p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt; In the territory of the [[Aequi]], another Italic people, Mars had an [[oracle]] of great antiquity where the prophecies were supposed to be spoken by a woodpecker perched on a wooden column.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius Halicarnassus]], ''Roman Antiquities'' I.14.5, as noted by Mary Emma Armstrong, ''The Significance of Certain Colors in Roman Ritual'' (George Banta Publishing, 1917), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mars's association with the wolf is familiar from what may be the most famous of [[Roman mythology|Roman myths]], the story of how a [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]] ''(lupa)'' suckled his infant sons when they were [[Infanticide#Greece and Rome|exposed]] by order of [[Amulius|King Amulius]], who feared them because he had [[usurper|usurped]] the throne from their grandfather, [[Numitor]].&lt;ref&gt;The myth of the she-wolf, and the birth of the twins with Mars as their father, is a long and complex tradition that weaves together multiple stories about the founding of Rome. See [[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. xiii, 73ff. ''et passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; The woodpecker also brought nourishment to the twins.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Romulus'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Romulus*.html 4.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wolf appears elsewhere in Roman art and literature in masculine form as the animal of Mars. A statue group that stood along the [[Appian Way]] showed Mars in the company of wolves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 22.1.12, as cited by Wiseman, ''Remus'', p. 189, note 6, and Armstrong, ''The Significance of Certain Colors'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of Sentinum]] in 295 BCE, the appearance of the wolf of Mars ''(Martius lupus)'' was a sign that Roman victory was to come.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' 10.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gallo-Roman culture|Roman Gaul]], the goose was associated with the [[#Provincial epithets|Celtic forms of Mars]], and archaeologists have found geese buried alongside warriors in graves. The goose was considered a bellicose animal because it is easily provoked to aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Green, ''Animals in Celtic Life and Myth'' (Routledge, 1992), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacrificial animals===
[[File:Suovetaurilia.jpg|thumb|left|The procession of the ''[[suovetaurilia]]'', a sacrifice of a pig, ram, and bull, led by a priest with his head [[capite velato|ritually covered]]]]
[[Religion in ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] and Roman religion distinguished between animals that were sacred to a deity and those that were prescribed as the correct [[animal sacrifice|sacrificial offerings]] for the god. Wild animals might be viewed as already belonging to the god to whom they were sacred, or at least not owned by human beings and therefore not [[Do ut des|theirs to give]]. Since sacrificial meat was eaten at a banquet after the gods received their portion&amp;nbsp;– mainly the entrails ''([[exta]])'' – it follows that the animals sacrificed were most often, though not always, domestic animals normally part of the Roman diet.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Belayche, "Religious Actors in Daily Life: Practices and Related Beliefs," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 283; C. Bennett Pascal, "October Horse," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 85 (1981), pp. 268, 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Gods often received castrated male animals as sacrifices, and the goddesses female [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|victims]]; Mars, however, regularly received intact males.&lt;ref&gt;As did Neptune, Janus and the [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]]; [[John Scheid]], "Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; Mars did receive [[oxen]] under a few of his cult titles, such as [[#Mars Grabovius|Mars Grabovius]], but the usual offering was the bull, singly, in multiples, or in combination with other animals.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The two most distinctive animal sacrifices made to Mars were the ''[[suovetaurilia]]'', a triple offering of a pig ''(sus)'', ram ''(ovis)'' and bull ''(taurus)'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[October Horse]], the only [[horse sacrifice]] known to have been carried out in ancient Rome and a rare instance of a victim the Romans considered inedible.&lt;ref&gt;C. Bennett Pascal, "October Horse," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 85 (1981), pp. 263, 268, 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temples and topography in Rome==
The earliest center in Rome for cultivating Mars as a deity was the Altar of Mars ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ara|Ara]] Martis)'' in the [[Campus Martius]] ("Field of Mars") outside the sacred boundary of Rome ''([[pomerium]])''. The Romans thought that this altar had been established by the semi-legendary [[Numa Pompilius]], the peace-loving successor of Romulus.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roman tradition, the Campus Martius had been consecrated to Mars by their ancestors to serve as horse pasturage and an equestrian training ground for youths.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Roman Antiquities'' 5.13.2&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BCE), the Campus was a largely open expanse. No temple was built at the altar, but from 193 BCE a covered walkway connected it to the [[Porta Fontinalis]], near the office and archives of the [[Roman censor]]s. Newly elected censors placed their [[curule chair]]s by the altar, and when they had finished conducting the census, the citizens were collectively [[lustrum|purified]] with a suovetaurilia there.&lt;ref&gt;Livy 40.45.8, 1.44.1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[frieze]] from the so-called [[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus|"Altar" of Domitius Ahenobarbus]] is thought to depict the census, and may show Mars himself standing by the altar as the procession of victims advances.&lt;ref&gt;Katja Moede, "Reliefs, Public and Private," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tempio di Marte Ultore (Roma) - Laterale.jpg|thumb|Remains of the [[Temple of Mars Ultor]] in the Forum of Augustus, Rome]]
The main Temple of Mars ''([[Aedes (Roman)|Aedes]] Martis)'' in the Republican period also lay outside the sacred boundary{{where|date=October 2018}} and was devoted to the god's warrior aspect.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitruvius]] 1.7.1; [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 1.292; Richardson, ''New Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; It was built to fulfill a vow ''([[votum]])'' made by a Titus [[Quinctia gens|Quinctius]] in 388 BCE during the [[Gallic siege of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 6.5.7; Richardson, ''New Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The founding day ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|dies natalis]])'' was commemorated on June 1,&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' 6.191–192 and the ''[[Fasti Antiates]]'' (Degrassi 463), as cited by Richardson, ''New Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; and the temple is attested by several inscriptions and literary sources.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 6.473, 474 = 30774, 485; ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 3139, 3144, as cited by Richardson, ''New Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture group of Mars and the wolves was displayed there.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers sometimes assembled at the temple before heading off to war, and it was the point of departure for a major parade of [[Roman cavalry]] held annually on July 15.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies,'' pp. 127, 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

A temple to Mars in the [[Circus Flaminius]] was built around 133 BCE, funded by [[Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus]] from war booty. It housed a colossal statue of Mars and a nude Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 36.26; Richardson, ''New Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Campus Martius continued to provide venues for equestrian events such as [[chariot racing]] during the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], but under the first emperor [[Augustus]] it underwent a major program of urban renewal, marked by monumental architecture. The Altar of Augustan Peace ''([[Ara Pacis Augustae]])'' was located there, as was the [[Obelisk of Montecitorio]], imported from [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]] to form the pointer ''([[gnomon]])'' of the [[Solarium Augusti]], a giant [[sundial]]. With its public gardens, the Campus became one of the most attractive places in the city to visit.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rehak, ''Imperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the Northern Campus Martius'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2006), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustus made the centrepiece of his new forum a large Temple to Mars Ultor, a manifestation of Mars he cultivated as the avenger ''(ultor)'' of the [[assassination of Julius Caesar|murder of Julius Caesar]] and of the military disaster suffered at the [[Battle of Carrhae]]. When the legionary standards lost to the Parthians were recovered, they were housed in the new temple. The date of the temple's dedication on May 12 was aligned with the [[heliacal setting]] of the constellation [[Scorpio (constellation)|Scorpio]], the [[Astrological sign|sign]] of war.&lt;ref&gt;Rehak, ''Imperium and Cosmos,'' p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The date continued to be marked with [[ludi circenses|circus games]] as late as the mid-4th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Renee Salzman, ''On Roman Time: The Codex Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity'' (University of California Press, 1990), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large statue of Mars was part of the short-lived [[List of Roman triumphal arches|Arch of Nero]], which was built in 62 CE but dismantled after [[Nero]]'s suicide and disgrace ''([[damnatio memoriae]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''New Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman art]], Mars is depicted as either bearded and mature, or young and clean-shaven. Even [[Nude (art)|nude]] or seminude, he often wears a helmet or carries a spear as emblems of his warrior nature. Mars was among the deities to appear on the earliest Roman coinage in the late 4th and early 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Williams, "Religion and Roman Coins," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Altar of Peace ''(Ara Pacis)'', built in the last years of the 1st century BCE, Mars is a mature man with a "handsome, [[Classicism|classicizing]]" face, and a short curly beard and moustache. His helmet is a plumed [[neo-Attic]]-[[Attic helmet|type]]. He wears a military cloak ''([[paludamentum]])'' and a [[muscle cuirass|cuirass]] ornamented with a [[gorgoneion]]. Although the [[relief]] is somewhat damaged at this spot, he appears to hold a spear [[laurel wreath|garlanded in laurel]], symbolizing a peace that is won by military victory. The 1st-century statue of Mars found in the [[Forum of Nerva]] (pictured at top) is similar. In this guise, Mars is presented as the dignified ancestor of the Roman people. The panel of the ''Ara Pacis'' on which he appears would have faced the Campus Martius, reminding viewers that Mars was the god whose altar Numa established there, that is, the god of Rome's oldest civic and military institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rehak and John G. Younger, ''Imperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the Northern Campus Martius'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2006), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly in works of art influenced by [[ancient Greek art|the Greek tradition]], Mars may be portrayed in a manner that resembles Ares, youthful, beardless, and often nude.&lt;ref&gt;Rehak and Younger, ''Imperium and Cosmos'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Renaissance, Mars's nudity was thought to represent his lack of fear in facing danger.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Mars", in ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 564, citing Sebastiano Erizzo, ''On Ancient Medallions'' (1559), p. 120.&lt;!--although I can't find it in that source--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===The spear of Mars===
The spear is the instrument of Mars in the same way that Jupiter wields the lightning bolt, [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] the trident, and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] the scythe or sickle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martianus Capella]] 5.425, with Mars specified as Gradivus and Neptune named as [[Portunus (mythology)|Portunus]].&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Relics in classical antiquity|relic]] or [[fetishism|fetish]] called the spear of Mars&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''Antiquitates'' frg. 254* (Cardauns); [[Plutarch]], ''Romulus'' 29.1 (a rather muddled account); [[Arnobius]], ''Adversus nationes'' 6.11.&lt;/ref&gt; was kept in a ''[[sacellum|sacrarium]]'' at the [[Regia]], the former residence of the [[Kings of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The spear was said to move, tremble or vibrate at impending war or other danger to the state, as was reported to occur before the [[assassination of Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]], ''Attic Nights'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/4*.html#6.1 4.6.1]; [[Cassius Dio]] [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/44*.html#17.2 44.17.2] (because Caesar was [[pontifex maximus]]); Veit Rosenberger, "Republican ''Nobiles:'' Controlling the ''Res Publica''," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion,'' p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; When Mars is pictured as a peace-bringer, his spear is wreathed with laurel or other vegetation, as on the Ara Pacis or a coin of [[Aemilianus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Imperium and Cosmos'' p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Priesthoods==
The high priest of Mars in Roman public religion was the [[Flamen Martialis]], who was one of the three major priests in the fifteen-member [[collegium|college]] of [[flamen]]s. Mars was also served by the [[Salii]], a twelve-member priesthood of patrician youths who dressed as archaic warriors and danced in procession around the city in March. Both priesthoods extend to the earliest periods of Roman history, and [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician birth]] was required.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Smith, "The Religion of Archaic Rome," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals and rituals==
The festivals of Mars cluster in his namesake month of March (Latin: ''[[Martius (month)|Martius]]''), with a few observances in October, the beginning and end of the season for military campaigning and agriculture. Festivals with horse racing took place in the Campus Martius. Some festivals in March retained characteristics of new year festivals, since ''Martius'' was originally the first month of the [[Roman calendar]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[File:Cornelia50.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Denarius]], issued 88 BCE, depicting the helmeted head of Mars, with [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory]] driving a two-horse chariot (''[[biga (chariot)|biga]]'') on the reverse]]
* February 27: [[Equirria]], involving [[chariot racing|chariot]] or horse races;
* March 1: Mars's ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|dies natalis]]'' ("birthday"), a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|feria]]'' also sacred to [[#Birth|his mother Juno]];&lt;ref&gt;Marked as such only on the [[Chronography of 354]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* March 14: a second Equirria, again with chariot races;
* March 14 or 15: [[Mamuralia]], a new year festival when a figure called [[Mamurius Veturius]] (perhaps the "old Mars" of the old year) is driven out;
* March 17: an [[Agonalia#Agonium Martiale|Agonalia or ''Agonium Martiale'']], an obscure type of observance held at other times for various deities;
* March 23: [[Tubilustrium]], a purification of the deploying army March 23;
* October 15: the ritual of the [[October Horse]], with a chariot race and Rome's only known [[horse sacrifice]];
* October 19: [[Armilustrium]] ("purification of arms").

Mars was also honored by chariot races at the [[Robigalia]] and [[Consualia]], though these festivals are not primarily dedicated to him. From 217 BCE onward, Mars was among the gods honored at the [[lectisternium]], a banquet given for deities who were present as images.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Roman hymns ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#carmen|carmina]])'' are rarely preserved, but Mars is invoked in two. The [[Arval Brothers]], or "Brothers of the Fields," chanted a hymn to Mars while performing their three-step dance.&lt;ref&gt;The hymn is preserved in an inscription ''([[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 6.2104); Frances Hickson Hahn, "Performing the Sacred," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Carmen Saliare]]'' was sung by Mars's priests the Salii while they moved twelve sacred shields ''([[ancilia]])'' throughout the city in a procession.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, "Performing the Sacred," p. 237, citing [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] 2.70.1–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century AD, [[Quintilian]] remarks that the language of the Salian hymn was so archaic that it was no longer fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintilian]], ''Institutiones'' 1.6.40, as cited by Frances Hickson Hahn, in "Performing the Sacred," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and cult epithets==
[[Image:0 Mars de Todi - Museo Gregoriano Etruscano (1).JPG|thumb|upright|The so-called ''[[Mars of Todi]]'', an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] bronze of the early 4th century BCE, probably depicting a warrior&lt;ref&gt;Guiliano Bonfante and [[Larissa Bonfante]], ''The Etruscan Language: An Introduction'' (Manchester University Press, 1983, 2002 rev.ed.), p. 26; Donald Strong and J.M.C. Toynbee, ''Roman Art'' (Yale University Press, 1976, 1988), p. 33; Fred S. Kleiner, introduction to ''A History of Roman Art'' (Wadsworth, 2007, 2010 "enhanced edition"), [https://books.google.com/books?id=r-r0S-z-UxkC&amp;pg=PR40&amp;dq=mars+todi+bronze&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IiSYT_m2D4OK8QSGz5T9BQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mars%20todi%20bronze&amp;f=false p. xl.]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Mars gave his name to the third month in the [[Roman calendar]], ''[[Martius (month)|Martius]]'', from which English "March" derives. In the most ancient Roman calendar, ''Martius'' was the first month. The [[planet Mars]] was named for him, and in some allegorical and philosophical writings, the planet and the god are endowed with shared characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;"Mars," ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt; In many languages, [[Tuesday]] is [[Week-day names#Planetary|named for the planet Mars or the god of war]]: In Latin, ''martis dies'' ("Mars's Day"), survived in [[Romance languages]] as ''marte'' ([[History of Portuguese|Portuguese]]), ''martes'' ([[History of Spanish|Spanish]]), ''mardi'' ([[History of French|French]]), ''martedì'' ([[History of Italian|Italian]]), ''marți'' ([[History of Romanian|Romanian]]), and ''dimarts'' ([[History of Catalan|Catalan]]). In Irish (Gaelic), the day is ''An Mháirt'', while in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] it is ''e Marta''. The English word ''Tuesday'' derives from [[Old English]] "Tiwesdæg" and means "Tiw's Day", ''Tiw'' being the Old English form of the Proto-Germanic war god *Tîwaz, or [[Týr]] in Norse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Tuesday Online Etymology Dictionary.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Roman religion===
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|Classical Roman religion]], Mars was invoked under several titles, and the first Roman emperor Augustus thoroughly integrated Mars into [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]]. The 4th-century Latin historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] treats Mars as one of several classical Roman deities who remained "cultic realities" up to his own time.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Rike, ''Apex Omnium: Religion in the ''Res Gestae'' of Ammianus'' (University of California Press, 1987), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Mars, and specifically Mars Ultor, was among the gods who received sacrifices from [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], the only emperor to reject Christianity after the conversion of [[Constantine I]]. In 363 AD, in preparation for the [[Battle of Ctesiphon (363)|Siege of Ctesiphon]], Julian sacrificed ten "very fine" bulls to Mars Ultor. The tenth bull violated ritual protocol by attempting to break free, and when killed and [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#litatio|examined]], produced [[Exta|ill omens]], among the many that were read at the end of Julian's reign. As represented by Ammianus, Julian swore never to make sacrifice to Mars again—a vow kept with his death a month later.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus 24.6.17; Rike, ''Apex Omnium,'' p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mars Gradivus====
Gradivus was one of the gods by whom a general or soldiers might swear an oath to be valorous in battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 2.45.&lt;/ref&gt; His temple outside the [[Porta Capena]] was where armies gathered. The archaic priesthood of Mars Gradivus was the ''[[Salii]]'', the "leaping priests" who danced ritually in armor as a prelude to war.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 1.20, {{cite book|author1=Livy|author-link1=Livy|last2=Warrior|first2=Valerie M|title=The History of Rome, Books 1–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M-ikf_c0rB0C&amp;pg=PA31|year=1884|publisher=Hackett Publishing|isbn=1-60384-381-7}}, with note by Valerie M. Warrior, ''The History of Rome Books 1–5'' (Hackett, 2006), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; His cult title is most often taken to mean "the Strider" or "the Marching God," from ''gradus'', "step, march."&lt;ref&gt;Compare ''[[Gradiva]]''. The second-century grammarian [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] offers two other explanations in addition. The name, he says, might also mean the vibration of a spear, for which the Greeks use the word ''kradainein''; others locate the origin of Gradivus in the grass ''(gramine)'', because the [[Grass Crown]] is the highest military honor; see Carole Newlands, ''Playing with Time: Ovid and the Fasti'' (Cornell University Press, 1995), p. 106. [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]] says that grass was sacred to Mars (note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 12.119).&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[Statius]] addresses him as "the most implacable of the gods,"&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''[[Thebaid (Latin poem)|Thebaid]]'' 9.4. See also 7.695.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Valerius Maximus]] concludes his [[Roman historiography|history]] by invoking Mars Gradivus as "author and support of the name 'Roman'":&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]] 2.131.1, ''auctor ac stator Romani nominis''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradivus is asked – along with Capitoline Jupiter and [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], as the keeper of Rome's perpetual flame – to "guard, preserve, and protect" the [[state of Rome]], the peace, and the ''[[princeps]]'' (the emperor [[Tiberius]] at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Friedrich Mueller, ''Roman Religion in Valerius Maximus'' (Routledge, 2002), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

A source from [[Late Antiquity]] says that the wife of Gradivus was [[#Consort|Nereia]], the daughter of [[Nereus]], and that he loved her passionately.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martianus Capella]], ''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'' 1.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mars Quirinus====
[[Image:Antoninianus Aemilianus-RIC 0015.jpg|thumb|Mars celebrated as peace-bringer on a Roman coin issued by [[Aemilianus]]]]
Mars Quirinus was the protector of the [[Quirites]] ("citizens" or "civilians") as divided into ''[[curia]]e'' (citizen assemblies), whose oaths were required to make a treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=R. E. A.|author-link=R. E. A. Palmer|title=The Archaic Community of the Romans|url=https://archive.org/details/archaiccommunity0000palm|url-access=registration|year=1970|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-07702-6}}, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; As a guarantor of treaties, Mars Quirinus is thus a god of peace: "When he rampages, Mars is called ''Gradivus'', but when he's at peace ''Quirinus''."&lt;ref&gt;''Mars enim cum saevit Gradivus dicitur, cum tranquillus est Quirinus'': [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 1.292, at [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+A.+1.292&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053 Perseus.] At ''Aeneid'' 6.860, Servius further notes: "Quirinus is the Mars who presides over peace and whose cult is maintained within the civilian realm, for the Mars of war has his [[Templum|temple]] outside that realm." See also Belier, ''Decayed Gods'', p. 92: "The identification of the two gods is a reflection of a social process. The men who till the soil as Quirites in times of peace are identical with the men who defend their country as Milites in times of war."&lt;/ref&gt;

The deified [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]] was identified with Mars Quirinus. In the [[Capitoline Triad]] of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], Mars, and [[Quirinus]], however, Mars and Quirinus were two separate deities, though not perhaps in origin. Each of the three had his own [[flamen]] (specialized priest), but the functions of the [[Flamen Martialis]] and [[Flamen Quirinalis]] are hard to distinguish.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, ''The Archaic Community of the Romans'', pp. 165–171. On how Romulus became identified with Mars Quirinus, see the Dumézilian summary of Belier, ''Decayed Gods'', p. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mars Grabovius====
Mars is invoked as ''Grabovius'' in the [[Iguvine Tablets]], bronze tablets written in [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]] that record ritual protocols for carrying out public ceremonies on behalf of the city and community of [[Gubbio|Iguvium]]. The same title is given to Jupiter and to the Umbrian deity Vofionus. This triad has been compared to the Archaic Triad, with Vofionus equivalent to Quirinus.&lt;ref&gt;Etymologically, Quirinus is ''*co-uiri-no'', "(the god) of the community of men ''(viri)''," and Vofionus is ''*leudhyo-no'', "(the god) of the people": Oliver de Cazanove, "Pre-Roman Italy, Before and Under the Romans," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 49. It has also been argued that Vofionus corresponds to [[Janus]], because an entry in [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] (204, edition of Lindsay) indicates there was a Roman triad of Jupiter, Mars, and Janus, each having ''quirinus'' as a title; C. Scott Littleton, ''The New Comparative Mythology'' (University of California Press, 1966, 1973), p. 178, citing Vsevolod Basanoff, ''Les dieux Romains'' (1942).&lt;/ref&gt; Tables I and VI describe a complex ritual that took place at the three gates of the city. After the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#auspicia|auspices]] were taken, two groups of three [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|victims]] were sacrificed at each gate. Mars Grabovius received three oxen.&lt;ref&gt;O. de Cazanove, "Pre-Roman Italy," pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mars Pater====
[[File:Casa di Marco Lucrezio Frontone (Pompei) WLM 021.JPG|thumb|Fresco in [[Pompeii]] depicting the wedding of Venus and Mars, 1st century BCE - 1st century CE]]
"Father Mars" or "Mars the Father" is the form in which the god is invoked in the agricultural prayer of Cato,&lt;ref&gt;The Indo-European character of this prayer is discussed by [[Calvert Watkins]], "Some Indo-European Prayers: Cato's Lustration of the Fields," in ''[[How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European Poetics]]'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), pp. 197–213.&lt;/ref&gt; and he appears with this title in several other literary texts and inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Celia E. Schultz, "Juno Sospita and Roman Insecurity in the Social War," in ''Religion in Republican Italy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 217, especially note 38.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mars Pater'' is among the several gods invoked in the ritual of ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#devotio|devotio]]'', by means of which a general sacrificed himself and the lives of the enemy to secure a Roman victory.&lt;ref&gt;For the text of this vow, see [[Novensiles#The invocation of Decius Mus|The invocation of Decius Mus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Mars is the regular recipient of the ''[[suovetaurilia]]'', the sacrifice of a pig ''(sus)'', ram ''(ovis)'' and bull ''(taurus)'', or often a bull alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 71ff. for examples of a bull offering, p. 153 on the ''suovetaurilia''.&lt;/ref&gt; To ''Mars Pater'' other epithets were sometimes appended, such as ''Mars Pater Victor'' ("Father Mars the Victorious"),&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al.'', "Religions of Rome'', p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; to whom the Roman army sacrificed a bull on March 1.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Henig, ''Religion in Roman Britain'' (London, 1984, 1995), p. 27, citing the military calendar from [[Dura-Europos]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''pater'' and ''mater'' were fairly common as honorifics for a deity,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War'' (University of California Press, 2005), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; any special claim for Mars as father of the Roman people lies in the mythic genealogy that makes him the divine father of [[Romulus and Remus]].&lt;ref&gt;Newlands, ''Playing with Time'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mars Silvanus====
In the section of his farming book that offers recipes and medical preparations, Cato describes a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#votum|votum]]'' to promote the health of cattle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Make an offering to Mars Silvanus in the forest ''(in silva)'' during the daytime for each head of cattle: 3 pounds of meal, 4½  pounds of bacon, 4½  pounds of meat, and 3 pints of wine. You may place the [[wikt:viands|viands]] in one vessel, and the wine likewise in one vessel. Either a slave or a free man may make this offering. After the ceremony is over, consume the offering on the spot at once. A woman may not take part in this offering or see how it is performed. You may vow the vow every year if you wish.&lt;ref&gt;''Votum pro bubus, uti valeant, sic facito. Marti Silvano in silva interdius in capita singula boum votum facito. Farris L. III et lardi P.39 IIII S et pulpae P. IIII S, vini S.40 III, id in unum vas liceto coicere, et vinum item in unum vas liceto coicere. Eam rem divinam vel servus vel liber licebit faciat. Ubi [[res divina]] facta erit, statim ibidem consumito. Mulier ad eam rem divinam ne adsit neve videat quo modo fiat. Hoc votum in annos singulos, si voles, licebit vovere.'' [[Cato the Elder]], ''On Farming'' 83, [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/E*.html#83 English translation] from the [[Loeb Classical Library]], Bill Thayer's edition at [[LacusCurtius]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That ''Mars Silvanus'' is a single entity has been doubted. [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#invocatio|Invocations of deities]] are often list-like, [[asyndeton|without connecting words]], and the phrase should perhaps be understood as "Mars and Silvanus".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "Silvanus," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 146; Peter F. Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus: A Study in Roman Folk Religion'' (Brill, 1992), pp. 8–9, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were explicitly excluded from some cult practices of Silvanus, but not necessarily of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus'', pp. 9 and 105ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Warde Fowler]], however, thought that the wild [[Silvanus (mythology)|god of the wood Silvanus]] may have been "an emanation or offshoot" of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mars Ultor====
[[File:Romanfortatbalmu00mill orig 0143 Mars.png|thumb|right|upright=0.5|A statue to Mars Ultor from [[Balmuildy]] on the [[Antonine Wall]] has been scanned and a video produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statue of Mars Ultor, Balmuildy|date=May 11, 2018|url=https://vimeo.com/269194099|access-date=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Augustus]] created the cult of "Mars the Avenger" to mark two occasions: his defeat of the [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassins of Caesar]] at [[Battle of Philippi|Philippi]] in 42 BCE, and the negotiated return of the [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman battle standards]] that had been lost to the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in 53 BCE.&lt;ref name="Augustus Assembles His Marble City"&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/roman-architecture/lecture/6whGG/9-4-augustus-assembles-his-marble-city | title=Augustus Assembles His Marble City | publisher=Yale University | people=Diana E. E. Kleiner | medium=Multimedia presentation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The god is depicted wearing a cuirass and helmet and standing in a "martial pose," leaning on a lance he holds in his right hand. He holds a shield in his left hand.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess [[Ultio]], a divine personification of vengeance, had an altar and golden statue in his temple.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Divine Qualities,'' pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Temple of Mars Ultor, dedicated in 2 BCE in the center of the [[Forum of Augustus]], gave the god a new place of honor.&lt;ref name="Augustus Assembles His Marble City"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "Mars," ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 135; [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Some rituals previously conducted within the cult of Capitoline Jupiter were transferred to the new temple,&lt;ref&gt;For instance, during the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], the ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'' was charged with the ritual ''[[clavum fingere|clavi figendi causa]]'', driving a nail into the wall of the Capitoline temple. According to [[Cassius Dio]] (55.10.4, as cited by Lipka, ''Roman Gods'', p. 108), this duty was transferred to a [[Roman censor|censor]] under Augustus, and the ritual moved to the Temple of Mars Ultor.&lt;/ref&gt; which became the point of departure for [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]] as they left for military campaigns abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Lipka, ''Roman Gods'', p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus required the [[Roman senate|Senate]] to meet at the temple when deliberating questions of war and peace.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Sidebottom, "International Relations," in ''The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare: Rome from the Late Republic to the Late Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), vol. 2, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple also became the site at which sacrifice was made to conclude the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Rites of passage|rite of passage]] of young men assuming the ''[[toga virilis]]'' ("man's toga") around age 14.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]] 55.10.2; Nicole Belyache, "Religious Actors in Daily Life," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

On various [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial holidays]], Mars Ultor was the first god to receive a sacrifice, followed by the [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]] of the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Lipka, ''Roman Gods'', pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[epigraphy|inscription]] from the 2nd century records a [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#votum|vow]] to offer Mars Ultor a bull with gilded horns.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' VI.1, no. 2086 (edition of Bormann and Henzen, 1876), as translated and cited by Charlotte R. Long, ''The Twelve Gods of Greece and Rome'' (Brill, 1987), pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Église Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul - Stèle Gallo-romaine 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragmentary dedication [[stele]] to Mars Augustus from [[Roman Gaul]]]]
''Augustus'' or ''Augusta'' was appended far and wide, "on monuments great and small,"&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hopkins, ''Conquerors and Slaves'' (Cambridge University Press, 1978), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; to the name of gods or goddesses, including Mars. The honorific marks the affiliation of a deity with [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]].&lt;ref&gt;A.E. Cooley, "Beyond Rome and Latium: Roman Religion in the Age of Augustus," in ''Religion in Republican Italy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 247; Duncan Fishwick, ''The imperial cult in the Latin West'' (Brill, 2005), ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hispania]], many of the statues and dedications to Mars Augustus were presented by members of the priesthood or [[Sodales|sodality]] called the ''[[Sodales Augustales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Edmondson, "The Cult of ''Mars Augustus'' and Roman Imperial Power at ''Augusta Emerita (Lusitania)'' in the Third Century A.D.: A New Votive Dedication," in ''Culto imperial: politica y poder'' («L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 2007), p. 562. These include an inscription that was later built into the castle walls at [[Sines]], Portugal; dedications at Ipagrum ([[Aguilar de la Frontera]], in the modern [[Province of Córdoba (Spain)|province of Córdoba]]) and at Conobaria ([[Las Cabezas de San Juan]] in the [[province of Seville]]) in Baetica; and a statue at Isturgi ''([[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' II. 2121 = ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' II&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/7, 56). A ''magister'' of the "[[Lares]] of Augustus" made a dedication to Mars Augustus ''([[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' II. 2013 = ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' II&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/5, 773) at Singili(a) Barba (Cerro del Castillón, [[Antequera]]).&lt;/ref&gt; These vows ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#votum|vota]])'' were usually fulfilled within a sanctuary of Imperial cult, or in a temple or precinct (''[[templum]]'') consecrated specifically to Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, "The Cult of ''Mars Augustus''," p. 563.&lt;/ref&gt; As with other deities invoked as ''Augustus'', altars to Mars Augustus might be set up to further the well-being (''[[salus]]'') of the emperor,&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, "The Cult of ''Mars Augustus''," p. 562.&lt;/ref&gt; but some inscriptions suggest personal devotion. An inscription in the [[Alps]] records the gratitude of a [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slave]] who dedicated a statue to Mars Augustus as ''conservator corporis sui'', the preserver of his own body, said to have been vowed ''ex iussu numinis ipsius'', "by the order of the ''[[numen]]'' himself".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 3160; Rudolf Haensch, "Inscriptions as Sources of Knowledge for Religions and Cults in the Roman World of Imperial Times," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mars Augustus'' appears in inscriptions at sites throughout the Empire, such as [[Hispania Baetica]], [[Sagunto|Saguntum]],&lt;ref&gt;William Van Andringa, "Religions and the Integration of Cities in the Empire in the Second Century AD: The Creation of a Common Religious Language," ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Emerita Augusta|Emerita]] ([[Lusitania]]) in Roman Spain;&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, "The Cult of ''Mars Augustus''," pp. 541–575.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leptis Magna]] (with a date of 6–7 AD) in present-day [[Libya]];&lt;ref&gt;Ittai Gradel, ''Emperor Worship and Roman Religion'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 238, note 11, citing Victor Ehrenberg and Arnold H.M. Jones, ''Documents Illustrating the Reigns of Augustus and Tiberius'' (Oxford University Press, 1955), no. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa|Sarmizegetusa]] in the [[Roman Dacia|province of Dacia]].&lt;ref&gt;The chief priest of the three Dacian provinces dedicated an altar ''pro salute'', for the wellbeing of [[Gordian III]], at an [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]] center sometime between 238 and 244 AD; Edmondson, "The Cult of ''Mars Augustus''," p. 562.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provincial epithets===
In addition to his cult titles at Rome, Mars appears in a large number of [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] in the [[Roman province|provinces]] of the [[Roman Empire]], and more rarely in literary texts, [[interpretatio romana|identified with]] a local deity by means of an [[epithet]]. Mars appears with great frequency in [[Gaul]] among the [[Continental Celts]], as well as in [[Hispania|Roman Spain]] and [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. In Celtic settings, he is often invoked as a healer.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Green, ''Animals in Celtic Life and Myth'' (Routledge, 1992), p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions indicate that Mars's ability to dispel the enemy on the battlefield was transferred to the sick person's struggle against illness; healing is expressed in terms of warding off and rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Ton Derks, ''Gods, Temples, and Ritual Practices: The Transformation of Religious Ideas and Values in Roman Gaul'' (Amsterdam University Press, 1998), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Celtic Mars====
Mars is identified with a number of Celtic deities, some of whom are not attested independently.

In discussing the Celtiberian Mars Neto, Macrobius associates Mars and [[Liber]], a Roman deity identified with Dionysus (''Saturnalia'' 1.19).&lt;/ref&gt; A reference in Pliny&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' 18.62.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests a connection to Mars's agricultural function, with the Gaulish word ''bracis'' referring to a type of wheat; a medieval Latin [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]] says it was used to make beer.&lt;ref&gt;In [[Galatian language|Galatian]], the form of Celtic spoken by the Celts who settled in [[Anatolia]], the word ''embrekton'' was a kind of beverage; Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire'', p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Mars Condatis''' occurs in several inscriptions from Roman Britain.{{efn| See [[Condatis]] &gt; [[Condatis#Archaeological evidence| Archaeological evidence]] }} The cult title is probably related to the place name ''Condate'', often used in Gaul for settlements at the confluence of rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''Dictionary of Celtic Religion and Culture'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The Celtic god [[Condatis]] is thought to have functions pertaining to water and healing.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Barri &amp; Mattingly, David (1990).

*'''Mars Loucetius'''. The Celtic god ''[[Loucetios]]'', Latinized as ''-ius'', appears in nine inscriptions in present-day Germany and France and one in Britain, and in three as ''Leucetius''. The [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] and [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]] [[wikt:theonym|theonyms]] likely derive from [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] ''*louk(k)et-'', "bright, shining, flashing," hence also "lightning,"&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'' (Éditions Errance, 2003), 2nd edition, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; alluding to either a Celtic commonplace [[metaphor]] between battles and thunderstorms (Old Irish ''torannchless'', the "thunder feat"), or the aura of a divinized hero (the ''lúan'' of [[Cú Chulainn]]). The name is given as an epithet of Mars. The consort of Mars Loucetius is [[Nemetona]], whose name may be understood as pertaining either to "sacred privilege" or to the [[sacred grove]] ''([[nemeton]])'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaulish]] ''[[nemeton]]'' was originally a [[sacred grove]] or space defined for religious purposes, and later a building: [[Bernhard Maier (religious studies professor)|Bernhard Maier]], ''Dictionary of Celtic Religion and Culture'' (Boydell Press, 1997, 2000, originally published 1994 in German), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; and who is also identified with the goddess [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]]. At the [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] site in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], a dedication to Mars Loucetius as part of this divine couple was made by a pilgrim who had come from the continental [[Treveri]] of [[Gallia Belgica]] to seek healing.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Birkham, entry on "Loucetius," in ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'', edited by John Koch (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 1192.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Mars Neton''' or '''[[Neto (deity)|Neto]]''' was a Celtiberian god at Acci (modern [[Guadix]]).

===="Mars Balearicus"====

"Mars Balearicus" is a name used in modern scholarship for small bronze warrior figures from [[Majorca]] (one of the [[Balearic Islands]]) that are interpreted as representing the local Mars cult.&lt;ref&gt;G. Llompart, "Mars Balearicus," ''Boletín del Seminario de Estudios de Arte y Arqueología'' 26 (1960) 101–128; "Estatuillas de bronce de Mallorca: Mars Balearicus," in ''Bronces y religión romana: actas del XI Congreso Internacional de Bronces Antiguos, Madrid, mayo-junio, 1990'' (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 1993), p. 57ff.&lt;/ref&gt; These statuettes have been found within [[Talaiot|talayotic]] sanctuaries with extensive evidence of burnt offerings. "Mars" is fashioned as a lean, athletic nude lifting a lance and wearing a helmet, often conical; the genitals are perhaps semi-erect in some examples.

Other bronzes at the sites represent the heads or horns of bulls, but the bones in the ash layers indicate that sheep, goats, and pigs were the sacrificial victims. Bronze horse-hooves were found in one sanctuary. Another site held an imported statue of [[Imhotep]], the legendary [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|Egyptian physician]]. These sacred precincts were still in active use when the Roman occupation began in 123 BCE. They seem to have been astronomically oriented toward the rising or setting of the [[constellation]] [[Centaurus]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaume García Rosselló, Joan Fornés Bisquerra, and Michael Hoskin, "Orientations of the Talayotic Sanctuaries of Mallorca," ''Journal of History of Astronomy, Archaeoastronomy Supplement'' 31 (2000), pp. 58–64 (especially note 10) [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?2000JHAS...31...58G&amp;defaultprint=YES&amp;filetype=.pdf pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saturn''' ({{lang-la|Sāturnus}} {{IPA-la|saːˈtʊrnʊs|}}) was a god in [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], and a character in [[Roman mythology]]. He was described as a god of time, generation, dissolution, abundance, wealth, agriculture, periodic renewal and liberation. Saturn's mythological reign was depicted as a [[Golden Age]] of abundance and peace. After the [[Roman conquest of Greece]], he was conflated with the Greek Titan [[Cronus]]. Saturn's consort was his sister [[Ops]], with whom he fathered [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]].

Saturn was especially celebrated during the festival of [[Saturnalia]] each December, perhaps the most famous of the [[Roman festivals]], a time of feasting, role reversals, free speech, gift-giving and revelry. The [[Temple of Saturn]] in the [[Forum Romanum|Roman Forum]] housed the state treasury and archives (''[[aerarium]]'') of the [[Roman Republic]] and the early [[Roman Empire]]. The planet [[Saturn]] and the day of the week [[Saturday]] are both named after and were associated with him.

==Mythology ==

The Roman land preserved the remembrance of a very remote time during which Saturn and [[Janus]] reigned on the site of the city before its foundation: the Capitol was called {{lang|la|mons Saturnius}}.{{refn|B. Liou Gilles "Naissance de la ligue latine. Mythe et cult de fondation" in ''Revue belge de philologie et d' histoire'' '''74''' 1. pp. 73–97: 75. {{doi|10.3406/rbph.1996.4096}}. citing Festus{{efn|''Saturnia Italia, et mons, qui nunc est Capitolinus, Saturnius appellabatur, quod in tutela Saturni esse existimantur. Saturnii quoque dicebantur, qui castrum in imo clivo Capitolino incolebant, ubi ara diacata ei deo ante bellum troianum videtur.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] |title=Saturnia |at=430 L}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and Ovid.{{efn|''A patre dicta meo quondam Saturnia Roma est.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Ovid]] |title=[[Fasti]] |at=6, 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} }}
The Romans identified Saturn with the Greek [[Cronus]], whose myths were adapted for [[Latin literature]] and [[Roman art]]. In particular, Cronus's role in the genealogy of the Greek gods was transferred to Saturn. As early as [[Lucius Livius Andronicus|Andronicus]] {{nobr|(3rd century BC),}} [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was called the son of Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;''Saturni filius'', frg. 2 in the edition of Baehrens.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saturn had two mistresses who represented different aspects of the god. The name of his wife, [[Ops]], the Roman equivalent of Greek [[Rhea (mythology)|''Rhea'']], means "wealth, abundance, resources."&lt;ref name=Mueller-2010-OxEnc&gt;&lt;br/&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Hans Friedrich |last=Mueller |title=Saturn |page=222 |encyclopedia=Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association with Ops is considered a later development, however, as this goddess was originally paired with [[Consus]].&lt;ref name=Dumézil-1974-1977/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 244}} Earlier was Saturn's association with [[Lua (goddess)|Lua]] ("destruction, dissolution, loosening"), a goddess who received the bloodied weapons of enemies destroyed in war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Dumézil|G. Dumézil]] (1968, 1959) "Lua Mater" in ''Déesses latines et mythes védiques'' Bruxelles pp. 98–115. Dumézil compared this Roman figure with Indian deity [[Nirṛti|Nírŗti]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Saturn's rule, humans enjoyed the spontaneous bounty of the earth without labour in the "Golden Age" described by [[Hesiod]] and [[Ovid]]. He became known as the god of time.

==Etymology and epithets==
{{Quote box |width = 33% |align = right |salign = right
 |quote = By Saturn they seek to represent that power which maintains the cyclic course of times and seasons. This is the sense that the Greek name of that god bears, for he is called [[Cronus]], which is the same as [[Chronos]] or [[Time]]. Saturn for his part got his name because he was "sated" with years; the story that he regularly devoured his own children is explained by the fact that time devours the courses of the seasons, and gorges itself "insatiably" on the years that are past. Saturn was enchained by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] to ensure that his circuits did not get out of control, and to constrain him with the bonds of the stars.

According to [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] |title=De lingua latina |at=5.64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saturn's name was derived from ''satus'', meaning  "sowing". Even though this etymology is problematic from the viewpoint of modern linguistics (for, while historically-motivated vowel length alternations do occur in Latin roots, the long ''ā'' in ''Sāturnus'' in particular remains unexplained with this etymology, and also because of the [[epigraphy|epigraphically]] attested form ''Saeturnus''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]] |at=I 2nd 449}}&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless it does reflect an original feature of the god.&lt;ref name=Briquel-1981/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 144}} Perhaps a more probable etymology connects the name with the Etruscan god ''[[Satre (Etruscan god)|Satre]]'' and placenames such as ''Satria'', an ancient town of Latium, and ''Saturae palus'', a marsh also in Latium. This root may be related to Latin [[wikt:phytonym|phytonym]] ''[[Satureja|satureia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
(Like ''satus'', however, ''satureia'', ''Saturae palus'', and probably also ''Satria'', as indeed the apparently closely related ''[[Satricum]]'', all also have a short ''a'' in the first syllable vs. the long ''ā'' of ''Sāturnus''.)

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Roman farming|Farming]] was important to Roman identity, and Saturn was a part of archaic Roman religion and ethnic identity. His name appears in the ancient hymn of the [[Salii|Salian priests]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
and his temple was the oldest known in the records of the [[College of Pontiffs|pontiffs]].

[[Quintus Lucilius Balbus]] gives a separate etymology in [[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero's]] ''[[De Natura Deorum]]''.&lt;ref name=Cicero-Walsh-2008/&gt; In this interpretation, the agricultural aspect of Saturn would be secondary to his primary relation with time and seasons. Since 'Time consumes all things', [[Quintus Lucilius Balbus|Balbus]] asserts that the name ''Saturn'' comes from the Latin word [[wikt:satis#Latin|''satis'']]; Saturn being an [[anthropomorphic]] representation of [[Time]], which is filled, or satiated, by all things or all generations. Since farming is so closely linked to [[seasons]] and therefore an understanding of the cyclical passage of time, it follows that agriculture would then be associated with the deity Saturn.

==Temple==
The temple of Saturn was located at the base of the [[Capitoline Hill]], according to a tradition recorded by [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] 
|title=Lingua Latina |at=V 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly known as ''Saturnius Mons'', and a row of columns from the last rebuilding of the temple still stands.&lt;ref name=Mueller-2010-OxEnc/&gt; The temple was consecrated in 497 BC but the ''area Saturni'' was built by king [[Tullus Hostilius]] as confirmed by archaeological studies conducted by E. Gjerstad.{{refn|In ''Mélanges A. Grenier'' Bruxelles (1962) pp. 757-762 as cited by Briquel&lt;ref name=Briquel-1981/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 141}} }} It housed the state treasury ([[aerarium]]) throughout Roman history.

==Festival's time==
The position of Saturn's festival in the [[Roman calendar]] led to his association with concepts of time, especially the temporal transition of the [[New Year]].  In the Greek tradition, Cronus was sometimes conflated with [[Chronus]], "Time," and his devouring of his children taken as an allegory for the passing of generations. The sickle or scythe of [[Father Time]] is a remnant of the agricultural implement of Cronus-Saturn, and his aged appearance represents the waning of the old year with the birth of the new, in antiquity sometimes embodied by [[Aion (deity)|Aion]]. In [[late antiquity]], Saturn is [[syncretism|syncretized]] with a number of deities, and begins to be depicted as winged, as is [[Kairos]], "Timing, Right Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Samuel L. |last=Macy |title=Father Time |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Time |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1994 |pages=208–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Roman religion==

===Theology and worship===
[[File:Arch of SeptimiusSeverus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Ruins of the Temple of Saturn (eight columns to the far right) in February&amp;nbsp;2010, with three columns from the [[Temple of Vespasian and Titus]] (left) and the [[Arch of Septimius Severus]] (center)]]

The figure of Saturn is one of the most complex in Roman religion. [[Georges Dumézil|Dumézil]] refrained from discussing Saturn in his work on Roman religion on the grounds of insufficient knowledge.&lt;ref name=Dumézil-1974-1977&gt;{{cite book |first=G. |last=Dumézil |author-link=Georges Dumézil |orig-year=1974 |year=1977 |title=La religion romain archaïque |place=Paris, FR / Milan, IT |edition=Italian translation |at=part&amp;nbsp;I, chap.&amp;nbsp;5, page 244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, however, his follower [[Dominique Briquel]] has attempted a thorough interpretation of Saturn utilising [[Trifunctional hypothesis|Dumézil's three-functional theory]] of Indo-European religion, taking the ancient testimonies and the works of A. Brelich and G. Piccaluga as his basis.&lt;ref name=Briquel-1981&gt;&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. |last=Briquel |author-link=Dominique Briquel |year=1981 |title=Jupiter, Saturn et le Capitol. Essai de comparaison indoeuropéenne |journal=Revue de l' histoire des religions |volume=198 |issue=2 |pages=131–162|doi=10.3406/rhr.1981.4889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Brelich |year=1956 |title=Tre variazioni romane sul tema delle origini |place=Roma, IT}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |first=G. |last=Piccaluga |year=1974 |title=Terminus |place=Roma, IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difficulty scholars find in studying Saturn is in assessing what is original of his figure and what is due to later hellenising influences. Moreover, some features of the god may be common to Cronus but are nonetheless very ancient and can be considered proper to the Roman god, whereas others are certainly later and arrived after 217&amp;nbsp;BCE, the year in which the Greek customs of the [[Kronia]] were introduced into the Saturnalia.&lt;ref name=Briquel-1981/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 142 ff}}

====Briquel's analysis====
Among the features which are definitely authentic of the Roman god, Briquel identifies:

# the time of his festival in the calendar, which corresponds to the date of the consecration of his temple (the Greek Cronia on the other hand took place in June–July);
# his association with ''[[Lua (goddess)|Lua Mater]]'', and
# the location of his cult on the Capitol, which goes back to remote times.{{refn|&lt;ref name=Macrobius-Satrnla/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|at=1.7.-}} cited by Briquel&lt;ref name=Briquel-1981/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 143}} }}

These three elements in Briquel's view indicate that Saturn is a sovereign god. The god's strict relationship with the cults of the Capitoline Hill and in particular with Jupiter are highlighted by the legends concerning the refusal of gods [[Iuventas]] and [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]] to leave their abode in the shrines on the Capitol when the temple of Jupiter was to be built. These two deities correspond to the helper gods of the sovereign in Vedic religion (Briquel&lt;ref name=Briquel-1981/&gt; refers to [[Dhritarashtra]] and [[Vidura]], the figures of the [[Mahabharata]]) and to the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]] and [[Hecatoncheires]] in [[Hesiod]]. Whereas the helper gods belong to the second divine generation they become active only at the level of the third in each of the three instances of India, Greece and Rome, where they become a sort of continuation of Jupiter.{{efn|
Iuventas shows a clear Varunian character in the liaison of Romulus with the ''iuvenes'' the young soldiers; Terminus has a Mitran character even though he shows Varunian traits in allowing the enlargement of the borders (''propagatio finium''): Briquel&lt;ref name=Briquel-1981/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 134 n. 8.}}
}})

[[Georges Dumézil|Dumézil]] postulated a split of the figure of the sovereign god in Indoeuropean religion, which is embodied by Vedic gods [[Varuna]] and [[Mitra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=G. |last=Dumézil |author-link=Georges Dumézil |title=Mitra-Varuna |place=Paris, FR |year=1940}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |first=G. |last=Dumézil |author-link=Georges Dumézil |title=Les dieux souverains des Indo-Europééens |place=Paris, FR |year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the two, the first one shows the aspect of the magic, uncanny, awe inspiring power of creation and destruction, while the second shows the reassuring aspect of guarantor of the legal order in organised social life. Whereas in Jupiter these double features have coalesced, Briquel&lt;ref name=Briquel-1981/&gt; sees Saturn as showing the characters of a sovereign god of the [[trifunctional hypothesis|Varunian type]]. His nature becomes evident in his mastership over the annual time of crisis around the winter solstice, epitomised in the power of subverting normal codified social order and its rules, which is apparent in the festival of the [[Saturnalia]], in the mastership of annual fertility and renewal, in the power of annihilation present in his paredra Lua, in the fact that he is the god of a timeless era of abundance and bounty before time, which he reinstates at the time of the yearly crisis of the winter solstice.

In Roman and Etruscan reckoning Saturn is a wielder of lightning; no other agricultural god (in the sense of specialized human activity) is one.{{refn|{{cite book |author=[[Pliny the Elder]] |title=Natural History |at=II 138–139}} cited by Briquel&lt;ref name=Briquel-1981/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 151}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Maurus Servius Honoratus]] |title=Ad Aeneidem |at=I 42; XI 259}} }}{{efn|Saturn's lightning bolts are those of wintertime.}} Hence the mastership he has on agriculture and wealth cannot be that of a god of the third function, i.e. of production, wealth, and pleasure, but it stems from his magical lordship over creation and destruction. Although these features are to be found in Greek god Cronus as well, it appears that those features were proper to Roman Saturn's most ancient aspects, such as his presence on the Capitol and his association with Jupiter, who in the stories of the arrival of the [[Pelasgians]] in the land of the [[Sicels]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] |title=Roman Antiquities |at=I.19.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macrobius-Satrnla/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|at=1.7.27–31}} and that of the [[Argei]] orders human sacrifices to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Ovid]] |title=Fasti |at=V. 621–662, esp. 626–629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Briquel concludes that Saturn was a sovereign god of a time that the Romans perceived as no longer actual, that of the legendary origins of the world, before civilization.&lt;ref name=Briquel-1981/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 155}}

====Roman cult practices====
Sacrifices to Saturn were performed according to "Greek rite" (''[[ritus graecus]]''), with the head uncovered, in contrast to those of other major Roman deities, which were performed ''[[capite velato]]'', "with the head covered." Saturn himself, however, was represented as veiled (''involutus''), as for example in a wall painting from [[Pompeii]] that shows him holding a sickle and covered with a white veil. This feature is in complete accord with the character of a sovereign god of the Varunian type and is common with German god [[Odin]]. Briquel remarks [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] had already seen that the choice of the Greek rite was due to the fact that the god himself is imagined and represented as veiled, thence his sacrifice cannot be carried out by a veiled man: This is an instance of the reversal of the current order of things typical of the nature of the deity as appears in its festival.{{refn|
{{cite book |author=[[Maurus Servius Honoratus]] |title=Ad Aenaeidem |at=III 407}} cited by Briquel&lt;ref name=Briquel-1981/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 148}}
}}
Plutarch writes his figure is veiled because he is the father of truth.{{refn|
{{cite book |author=[[Plutarch]] |title=Quaestiones Romanae |at=II}} cited by Briquel&lt;ref name=Briquel-1981/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 148 n. 63}}
}}

[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] notes that the cult statue of Saturn was filled with oil; the exact meaning of this is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 15.32.&lt;/ref&gt; Its feet were bound with wool, which was removed only during the Saturnalia.&lt;ref name=Macrobius-Satrnla/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|at=1.8.5}} The fact that the statue was filled with oil and the feet were bound with wool may relate back to the myth of "The Castration of Uranus". In this myth Rhea gives Cronus a rock to eat in Zeus's stead, thus tricking Cronus. Although mastership of knots is a feature of Greek origin it is also typical of the Varunian sovereign figure, as apparent e.g. in Odin. Once Zeus was victorious over Cronus, he sets this stone up at Delphi and constantly it is anointed with oil and strands of unwoven wool are placed on it.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Graves, "The Greek Myths: 1" page 41&lt;/ref&gt; The stone wore a red cloak,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''De testimonio animae'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and was brought out of the temple to take part in [[pompa circensis|ritual processions]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Antiquitates Romanae'' 7.72.13.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[lectisternium|lectisternia]]'', banquets at which images of the gods were arranged as guests on couches.&lt;ref name=Mueller-2010-OxEnc/&gt; All these ceremonial details identify a sovereign figure.

Little evidence exists in Italy for the cult of Saturn outside Rome, but his name resembles that of the Etruscan god [[Satre (Etruscan god)|Satres]].{{efn|Found on the [[Piacenza Liver]]; see also [[Martianus Capella]] 1.58; Mueller (2010).&lt;ref name=Mueller-2010-OxEnc/&gt;}} The potential cruelty of Saturn was enhanced by his identification with [[Cronus]], known for devouring his own children. He was thus used in translation when referring to gods from other cultures the Romans perceived as severe; he was equated with the Carthaginian god [[Baal Hammon]], to whom children were sacrificed, and to [[Yahweh]], whose [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] was referred to as ''Saturni dies'', "Saturn's day," in a poem by [[Tibullus]], who wrote during the reign of [[Augustus]]; eventually this gave rise to the word "Saturday" in English.&lt;ref name=Mueller-2010-OxEnc/&gt; The identification with Ba'al Hammon later gave rise to the African Saturn, a cult that enjoyed great popularity until the 4th century. Besides being a popular cult it also had the character of a [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religion]] and required child sacrifices. It is also considered as inclining to monotheism.&lt;ref name=Leglay-1966&gt;{{cite book |first=Marcel |last=Leglay |year=1966 |title=Saturn africain |series=Histoire BEFAR |place=Paris, FR |publisher=de&amp;nbsp;Boccard}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ceremony of initiation the ''{{transl|grc|myste}}'' (initiate) "''intrat sub iugum''" ("enters beneath the yoke"), a ritual that Leglay compares to the Roman ''[[tigillum sororium]]''.&lt;ref name=Leglay-1966/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|pp= 385–386}} Even though their origin and theology are completely different the Italic and the African god are both sovereign and master over time and death, a fact that has permitted their association. However, the African Saturn is not directly derived from the Italic god, but rather from his Greek counterpart, Cronus.

===Saturnalia===
{{main|Saturnalia}}
Saturn is associated with a major religious festival in the Roman calendar, ''Saturnalia''.  Saturnalia celebrated the harvest and sowing, and ran from December 17–23.  During Saturnalia, the social restrictions of Rome were relaxed.  The figure of Saturn, kept during the year with its legs bound in wool, was released from its bindings for the period of the festival.&lt;ref name=Macrobius-Satrnla/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|at=1.8.5}} The revelries of Saturnalia were supposed to reflect the conditions of the lost "Golden Age" before the rule of Saturn was overthrown, not all of them desirable, except as a temporary relief from civilized constraint. The Greek equivalent was the [[Kronia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William F. |last=Hansen |title=Ariadne's Thread: A guide to international tales found in classical literature |place=Ithaca, NY |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |year=2002 |page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius|Macrobius]] {{nobr|(5th century CE)}} presents an interpretation of the Saturnalia as a festival of light leading to the [[winter solstice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jane |last=Chance |year=1994 |title=Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the Cchool of Chartres, A.D. 433–1177 |publisher=[[University Press of Florida]] |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macrobius-Satrnla/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|at=1.1.8–9}} The renewal of light and the coming of the new year was celebrated in the later [[Roman Empire]] at the ''Dies Natalis'' of [[Sol Invictus]], the "Birthday of the Unconquerable Sun," on December&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Robert A. |editor-last=Kaster |year=2011 |title=Macrobius: Saturnalia, Books 1–2 |series=[[Loeb Classical Library]] |at=note on p.&amp;nbsp;16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman legend==

It was customary for the Romans to represent divine figures as kings of [[Latium]] at the time of their legendary origins. 
Macrobius states explicitly that the Roman legend of Janus and Saturn is an affabulation, as the true meaning of religious beliefs cannot be openly expressed.&lt;ref name=Macrobius-Satrnla/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|at=1.7.18}} In the myth&lt;ref name=Macrobius-Satrnla/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|at=1.9.-}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Vergil]] |title=Aeneis |at=VII, 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saturn was the original and [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthonous]] ruler of the [[Capitolium]], which had thus been called the ''Mons Saturnius'' in older times and on which once stood the town of ''Saturnia''.&lt;ref name=Macrobius-Satrnla/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|at=1.7.27, 1.10.4}} {{refn|

He was sometimes regarded as the first king of [[Latium]] or even the whole of Italy.&lt;ref name=Versnel-1993-1994&gt;&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |first=H.S. |last=Versnel |orig-year=1993 |year=1994 |section=Saturnus and the Saturnalia |title=Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion: Transition and Reversal in Myth and Ritual |publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 138–139}} At the same time, there was a tradition that Saturn had been an immigrant god, received by [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]] after he was usurped by his son Jupiter and expelled from Greece.{{efn|
The Roman theologian [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] listed Saturn among the [[List of Roman deities#Sabine gods|Sabine gods]].&lt;ref name=Versnel-1993-1994/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 139}}
}}
In Versnel's view his contradictions – a foreigner with one of Rome's oldest sanctuaries, and a god of liberation who is kept in fetters most of the year – indicate Saturn's capacity for confounding social distinctions.&lt;ref name=Versnel-1993-1994/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|pp= 139, 142–143}}

The Golden Age of Saturn's reign in Roman mythology differed from the Greek tradition. He arrived in Italy "dethroned and fugitive,"&lt;ref name=Versnel-1993-1994/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 143}} but brought agriculture and civilization for which he was rewarded by Janus with a share of the kingdom, becoming himself king. As the Augustan poet [[Virgil]] described it, "He gathered together the unruly race" of [[faun]]s and [[nymph]]s "scattered over mountain heights, and gave them laws ...&amp;nbsp;. Under his reign were the golden ages men tell of: in such perfect peace he ruled the nations."{{refn|
{{cite book |author=[[Virgil]] |title=[[Aeneid]] |at=8.320–325}} cited by Versnel&lt;ref name=Versnel-1993-1994/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 143}}
}} He was considered the ancestor of the Latin nation as he fathered [[Picus]], the first king of Latium, who married Janus's daughter [[Canens (mythology)|Canens]] and in his turn fathered [[Faunus]].

[[File:Porta Maggiore Alatri.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Alatri's main gate of the cyclopean walls]]
Saturn was also said to have founded the five ''Saturnian'' towns of Latium: Aletrium (today [[Alatri]]), Anagnia ([[Anagni]]), Arpinum ([[Arpino]]), [[Atina, Lazio|Atina]] and Ferentinum ([[Ferentino]], also known as Antinum) all located in the [[Latin Valley]], [[province of Frosinone]]. All these towns are surrounded by [[cyclopean walls]]; their foundation is traditionally ascribed to the [[Pelasgians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Mario |last1=Pincherle |first2=Giuliana C. |last2=Volpi |year=1990 |title=La civiltà minoica in Italia: Le città saturnie |place=Pisa, IT |publisher=Pacini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Saturn also had a less benevolent aspect, as indicated by the blood shed in his honor during gladiatorial ''munera''. His consort in archaic Roman tradition was [[Lua (goddess)|Lua]], sometimes called ''Lua Saturni'' ("Saturn's Lua") and identified with Lua Mater, "Mother Destruction," a goddess in whose honor the weapons of enemies killed in war were burned, perhaps as expiation.&lt;ref name=Mueller-2010-OxEnc/&gt; Versnel, however, proposed that ''Lua Saturni'' should not be identified with ''Lua Mater'', but rather refers to "loosening"; she thus represents the liberating function of Saturn.&lt;ref name=Versnel-1993-1994/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 144}}

==Gladiatorial ''munera''==
Saturn's [[chthonic]] nature connected him to the underworld and its ruler [[Dis Pater]], the Roman equivalent of Greek [[Pluto (mythology)|Plouton]] (Pluto in Latin) who was also a god of hidden wealth.{{efn|

In 3rd-century AD sources and later, Saturn is recorded as receiving [[gladiator]]ial offerings ''(munera)'' during or near the Saturnalia.{{refn|

These gladiator combats, ten days in all throughout December, were presented by the [[quaestor]]s and sponsored with funds from the treasury of Saturn.{{efn|

The practice of gladiatorial ''munera'' was criticized by [[Christian apologists]] as a form of human sacrifice.&lt;ref name=Mueller-2010-OxEnc/&gt;&lt;ref name=Versnel-1993-1994/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 146}} Although there is no evidence of this practice during the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], the offering of gladiators led to later theorizing that the primeval Saturn had demanded human victims. [[Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius|Macrobius]] says that [[Dis Pater]] was placated with human heads and Saturn with sacrificial victims consisting of men ( ''virorum [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|victimis]]'' ).&lt;ref name=Macrobius-Satrnla/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|at=1.7.31}}&lt;ref name=Versnel-1993-1994/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 146}} The figurines that were exchanged as gifts ''([[sigillaria (ancient Rome)|sigillaria]])'' during the Saturnalia may have represented token substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;

Saturninus was a [[populares|popularist]] politician who had proposed reduced-price grain distribution to the poor of Rome. The head of the [[Roma (mythology)|goddess Roma]] appears on the obverse. The Saturnian imagery played on the tribune's name and his intent to alter the [[Social class in ancient Rome|social hierarchy]] to his advantage, by basing his political support on the common people (''[[plebs]]'') rather than the senatorial elite.&lt;ref name=Versnel-1993-1994/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|p= 162}}

[[File:Heiligenberg Heidelberg.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Heiligenberg (Heidelberg)|Heiligenberg]] near present-day [[Heidelberg]], where three inscriptions to Mercury Cimbrianus were found]]
'''Mercurius Cimbrianus''' or '''Cimbrius''' is a Germanic god mentioned in seven Roman dedicatory inscriptions. These inscriptions are from the territory of the Roman province of [[Germania Superior]] from the second to third centuries CE.

Three inscriptions were found in a Roman cult complex on the [[Heiligenberg (Heidelberg)|Heiligenberg]], near present-day [[Heidelberg]], which was used until late Antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;The three inscriptions are (A) {{CIL|13|6399}}, dating to the 2nd century CE; (B) {{CIL|13|6402}}, also dating to the 2nd century CE; and (C) {{AE|1921|52}}, dating from 171 to 250 CE.&lt;/ref&gt; Two finds from the vicinity of [[Miltenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;These two inscriptions are (A) {{CIL|13|6604}}, dating to the consulship of Apronianus and Bradua in 191 CE, and (B) {{CIL|13|6605}}, dating to 189 or 212 CE.&lt;/ref&gt; and two inscriptions from near Mogontiacum (present-day [[Mainz]]&lt;ref&gt;These inscriptions are (A) {{CIL|13|6742}} and (B) {{AE|1990|742}}, from sometime from 171 to 250 CE.&lt;/ref&gt;) make up the remainder of the documentation on this god.

The name ‘Cimbrianus’ is derived from that of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe&lt;ref&gt;The Cimbri are characterized as Germanic by [[Julius Caesar]] (''[[Gallic Wars|B. G.]]'' 1.33.3-4), [[Strabo]] (''Geographica'' 4.4.3 and 7.1.3), [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (''Nat. Hist.'' 4.100), and [[Tacitus]] (''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' 37, ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' 4.73), but as Celtic by Appian (''Civil Wars'' 1.4.29, ''Illyrica'' 8.3).&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Cimbri]], whose homeland is placed in the [[Jutland]] peninsula by ancient sources such as [[Strabo]] and [[Tacitus]],&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geogr.'' 7.2.1&lt;/ref&gt; and who began migrating southward in the late 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;The Cimbri defeated a Roman army at the [[Battle of Noreia]], for example, in 112 BCE; they were not decisively defeated by the Romans until the [[Battle of Vercellae]] in 101 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt;
From this it has been conjectured that the cult of Mercurius Cimbrianus was established in the [[Odenwald]] by some detachments of such Cimbri. Also near Miltenberg, another inscription mentions the presence of Teutons,&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|13|6610}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were associated with the Cimbri in their great 2nd-century BCE migration. As the god is [[interpretatio graeca#Interpretatio romana|identified]] with the Roman [[Mercury (god)|Mercury]], this ‘Mercury of the Cimbri’ is generally thought to represent the Germanic god [[Odin]] or *''Wōđanaz''.

'''Dīs Pater''' ({{IPAc-en|,|d|I|s|_|'|p|ei|t|@r}}; {{IPA-la|diːs patɛr|lang}}&lt;!--dubious accent, so none specified--&gt;; genitive ''Dītis Patris''), otherwise known as '''Rex Infernus''' or '''[[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]''', is a [[Roman mythology|Roman god]] of the [[underworld]]. Dis was originally associated with [[fertility (soil)|fertile]] agricultural land and [[mineral]] wealth, and since those minerals came from underground, he was later equated with the [[Chthonic|chthonic deities]] [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] ([[Hades]]) and [[Orcus (mythology)|Orcus]].

Dīs Pater's name was commonly shortened to '''''Dīs''''', and this name has since become an alternative name for the underworld or a part of the underworld, such as the [[Dis (Divine Comedy)|City of Dis]] of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', which comprises Lower Hell.

==Etymology==
The name ''Dīs'' is a contraction of the Latin adjective ''dīves'' ('wealthy, rich'), probably derived from ''dīvus, dīus'' ('godlike, divine') via the form ''*deiu-(o)t-'' or ''*deiu-(e)t-'' ('who is like the gods, protected by/from the gods').{{Sfn|de Vaan|2008|pp=173–174}}&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Latte, ''Römische Religionsgeschichte'', part 5, vol. 4 of ''Handbuch der Altertumswissenschaft'', C.H.Beck, 1976, {{ISBN|978-3-406-01374-4}}, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; The occurrence of the deity Dīs together with ''Pater'' ('father') may be due to association with ''Di(e)spiter'' ([[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]).{{Sfn|de Vaan|2008|pp=173–174}}

[[Cicero]] gave a similar etymology in ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'', suggesting the meaning 'father of riches', and comparing the deity to the Greek name [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] (''Plouton'', Πλούτων), meaning "the rich one", a title bestowed upon the Greek god [[Hades]].

==Mythology==

Dīs Pater eventually became associated with death and the [[underworld]] because mineral wealth such as gems and precious metals came from underground, wherein lies the realm of the dead, i.e. [[Hades]]' ([[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto's]]) domain.

In being conflated with [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], Dīs Pater took on some of the latter's [[Greek mythology|mythological]] attributes, being one of the three sons of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] (Greek [[Cronus]]) and [[Ops]] (Greek [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]), along with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (Greek [[Zeus]]) and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] (Greek [[Poseidon]]). He ruled the underworld and the dead beside his wife, [[Proserpina]] (Greek [[Persephone]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimal |title=The Dictionary of Classical Mythology |year=1987 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofclas00grim/page/141 141, 177] |publisher=Oxford: Basil Blackwell |isbn=0-631-13209-0 |url-access=registration |url= https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofclas00grim/page/141}}&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, Dīs Pater's name was commonly used as a symbolic and poetic way of referring to [[death]] itself.

Dīs Pater was sometimes identified with the [[Sabine]] god [[Soranus (mythology)|Soranus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]' commentary to [[Aeneid]], [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+A.+11.785&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053 XI. 785] "Mount Soracte is located in the territory of the Hirpini next to Via Flaminia. It was on this mountain that a sacrifice to Dis Pater was once performed – because it is devoted to chthonic deities – as wolves suddenly appeared and plundered the entrails from the ire. The shepherds chased the wolves for a long time, until they arrived at a cave emanating pestilential gases that killed people standing nearby. The reason for the emergence of this plague was that they had chased the wolves. They received a message that they could calm it down by imitating wolves; that means, living by plundering. They did so, and since then these people have been called Hirpi Sorani."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]], in his ''[[Commentaries on the Gallic Wars]]'' (''VI'':18), states that the [[Gauls]] all claimed descent from ''Dīs Pater''. This is an example of ''[[Interpretatio graeca#Interpretatio romana|interpretatio romana]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|title=Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend| pages=81&amp;ndash;82| publisher=London: Thames and Hudson| isbn=0-500-01516-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; what Caesar meant was that the Gauls all claimed descent from a Gaulish god that he equated with the Roman Dīs Pater.

A [[scholium]] on the [[Pharsalia]] equates Dis Pater with [[Taranis]], the Gaulish god of thunder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Rf8HAQAAIAAJ |title=Études celtiques |last=Vendryes |first=Joseph |year=1958 |publisher=Les Belles Lettres |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote needed|date=July 2020}}&lt;!--identify the source, which century?--&gt; In southern Germany and the Balkans, [[Aericura]] was considered a consort of Dīs Pater.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}{{year needed|date=July 2020}}

==Worship==
In 249&amp;nbsp;BC and 207&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Roman Senate]] under [[senator]] Lucius Catellius ordained special festivals to appease Dīs Pater and Proserpina. Every hundred years, a festival was celebrated in his name. According to legend, a round marble altar, ''Altar of Dīs Pater and Proserpina'' ({{lang-la|Ara Ditis Patris et Proserpinae}}), was miraculously discovered by the servants of a [[Sabine]] called Valesius, the ancestor of the first [[consul]]. The servants were digging in the [[Tarentum (Campus Martius)|Tarentum]] on the edge of the [[Campus Martius]] to lay foundations following instructions given to Valesius's children in dreams, when they found the altar {{convert|20|ft|0}} underground. Valesius reburied the altar after three days of games. Sacrifices were offered to this altar during the [[Secular games|''Ludi Saeculares'']] or ''Ludi Tarentini''. It may have been uncovered for each occasion of the games, to be reburied afterwards, a clearly [[chthonic]] tradition of worship. It was rediscovered in 1886–1887 beneath the Corso Vittorio Emanuele in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Vulcan''' ({{lang-la|Vulcanus}}, in archaically retained spelling also ''Volcanus'', both pronounced {{IPA-la|wʊɫˈkaːnʊs|}}) is the [[god of fire]]&lt;ref name=dumezil&gt;{{cite book |author=Georges Dumézil |author-link=Georges Dumézil |others=trans. Philip Krapp |title=Archaic Roman Religion: Volume One |orig-year=1966 |year=1996 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=0-8018-5482-2|pages=320–321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the fire of [[volcano]]es, [[desert]]s, metalworking and the [[forge]] in [[ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman mythology|myth]]. He is often depicted with a blacksmith's hammer.&lt;ref&gt;Corbishley, Mike "Ancient Rome" Warwick Press 1986 Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Vulcanalia''' was the annual [[Roman festival|festival]] held August 23 in his honor. His [[interpretatio graeca|Greek counterpart]] is [[Hephaestus]], the god of fire and smithery. In [[Etruscan religion]], he is identified with [[Sethlans (mythology)|Sethlans]].

Vulcan belongs to the most ancient stage of Roman religion: [[Varro]], the ancient Roman scholar and writer, citing the [[Annales Maximi]], records that king [[Titus Tatius]] dedicated altars to a series of deities including Vulcan.&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''De Lingua Latina'' V, X: "...Et arae Sabinum linguam olent, quae Tati regis voto sunt Romae dedicatae: nam, ut annales dicunt, vovit Opi, Florae, Vediovi Saturnoque, Soli, Lunae, Volcano et Summano, itemque Larundae, Termino, Quirino, Vortumno, Laribus, Dianae Lucinaeque...".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The origin of the name is unclear. Roman tradition maintained that it was related to [[Latin]] words connected to lightning ({{lang|la|fulgur, fulgere, fulmen}}), which in turn was thought of as related to flames.&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''Lingua Latina'' V, 10: "Ignis a gnascendo, quod huic nascitur et omne quod nascitur ignis succendit; ideo calet ut qui denascitur cum amittit ac frigescit. Ab ignis iam maiore vi ac violentia Volcanus dictus. Ab eo quod ignis propter splendor."&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is supported by [[Walter William Skeat]] in his etymological dictionary as meaning ''lustre''.&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Skeat ''Etymological Dictionary of the Benis Language'' New York 1963 (first published in 1882) s.v. ''volcano'': "cf. Sanskrit varchar-s: lustre".&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been supposed that his name was not Latin but related to that of the [[Crete|Cretan]] god ''[[Velchanos]]'', a god of nature and the nether world.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur B. Cook ''Zeus: a study in Ancient religion'' 1925  Vol. II, pp. 945 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolfgang Meid]] has disputed this identification as ''[[fantastic|phantastic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;W. Meid "Etrusc. Velkhans- Lat. Volcanus" ''Indogermanische Forschugungen'', '''66''' 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Meid and [[Vasily Abaev]] have proposed on their side a matching theonym in the [[Ossetian mythology|Ossetic]] legendary smith of the [[Nart saga]] [[Kurdalægon|Kurd-Alä-Wärgon]] ("the Alan smith Wärgon"), and postulated an original [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] smith god named *''wl̩kānos''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXrJA_5LKlYC|title=Indo-European Poetry and Myth|last=West|first=M. L.|date=2007-05-24|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-928075-9|pages=268|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; But since the name in its normal form is stable and has a clear meaning—''kurd'' ("smith") + ''on'' ("of the family") + ''Alaeg'' (the name of one of the Nartic families)—this hypothesis has been considered unacceptable by [[Dumezil]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''La religion romaine archaïque'' Paris, 1974, part II, chap. 2. It. tr. Milano 1977 p. 284 n. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian-Joseph Guyonvarc'h]] has proposed the identification with the [[Irish language|Irish]] name ''Olcan'' (Ogamic ''Ulccagni'', in the genitive).{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Gérard Capdeville finds a continuity between Cretan [[Minoan religion|Minoan]] god ''Velchanos'' and Etruscan ''Velchans''. The Minoan god's identity would be that of a young deity, master of fire and companion of the [[Great Goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Capdeville ''Volchanus. Rechérches comparatistes sur le culte de Vulcain''  Rome 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Martin Litchfield West|Martin L. West]], ''Volcanus'' may represent a god of the fire named ''*Volca'' and attached to the suffix ''-no-'', the typical appendage indicating the god's domain in [[Indo-European languages]]. ''*Volca'' could therefore be a cognate of the Sanskrit words ''ulkā'' ("darting flame") and/or ''várcas-'' ("brilliance, glare").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Worship==
Vulcan's oldest shrine in Rome, called the [[Vulcanal]], was situated at the foot of the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitoline]] in the [[Forum Romanum]], and was reputed to date to the archaic period of the [[kings of Rome]],&lt;ref name=platner&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Samuel Ball Platner |author-link=Samuel Ball Platner |author2=Thomas Ashby  |encyclopedia=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome |title=Volcanal |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Volcanal.html |access-date=2007-07-28 |year=1929 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London |pages=583–584 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bnp&gt;{{cite book |last=Beard |first=Mary |author-link=Mary Beard (classicist) |author2=John North |author3=Simon Price |title=Religions of Rome Volume 2: A Sourcebook |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-45015-2 |pages=no. 1.7c}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to have been established on the site by [[Titus Tatius]],&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, II.50.3; Varro V.74.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sabines|Sabine]] co-king, with a traditional date in the 8th century BC. It was the view of the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[haruspex|haruspices]] that a temple of Vulcan should be located outside the city,&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitruvius]] [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html#7 1.7]; see also [[Plutarch]], ''[[Roman Questions]]'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/C.html#47 47].&lt;/ref&gt; and the Vulcanal may originally have been on or outside the [[Pomerium|city limits]] before they expanded to include the [[Capitoline Hill]].&lt;ref name=dumezil/&gt; The Volcanalia sacrifice was offered here to Vulcan, on August 23.&lt;ref name=platner/&gt; Vulcan also had a temple on the [[Campus Martius]], which was in existence by 214 BC.&lt;ref name=dumezil/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0144:book=24:chapter=10 24.10.9].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans identified Vulcan with the Greek [[smith (metalwork)|smith]]-god [[Hephaestus]].&lt;ref name=Lar&gt;''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Vulcan became associated like his Greek counterpart with the constructive use of fire in [[metalworking]]. A fragment of a Greek pot showing Hephaestus found at the Volcanal has been dated to the 6th century BC, suggesting that the two gods were already associated at this date.&lt;ref name=bnp/&gt; However, Vulcan had a stronger association than Hephaestus with fire's destructive capacity, and a major concern of his worshippers was to encourage the god to avert harmful fires.

The festival of Vulcan, the Vulcanalia, was celebrated on August 23 each year, when the summer heat placed crops and granaries most at risk of burning.&lt;ref name=dumezil/&gt;&lt;ref name=fowler&gt;{{cite book |author=W.

"''[http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/erudits/Festus/p.htm piscatorii ludi]''"; [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], ''On the Latin Language'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/varro.ll6.html 6.3].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vulcanalia was part of the cycle of the four festivities of the second half of August (Consualia on August 21, Vulcanalia on 23, Opiconsivia on 25 and Vulturnalia on 27) related to the agrarian activities of that month and in symmetric correlation with those of the second half of July (Lucaria on July 19 and 21, Neptunalia on 23 and Furrinalia on 25). While the festivals of July dealt with untamed nature (woods) and waters (superficial waters the Neptunalia and underground waters the Furrinalia) at a time of danger caused by their relative deficiency, those of August were devoted to the results of human endeavour on nature with the storing of harvested grain (Consualia) and their relationship to human society and regality (Opiconsivia) which at that time were at risk and required protection from the dangers of the  excessive strength of the two elements of fire (Vulcanalia) and wind (Vulturnalia) reinforced by dryness.&lt;ref&gt;In Dumézil's interpretation the Vulturnalia were associated with the protection of riping grapes from a hot and dry southwestern wind named Vulturnus, not with the river Tiber, as Mommsen had supposed, or Vulturnus of Campania.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
It is recorded that during the Vulcanalia people used to hang their clothes and fabrics under the sun.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paulinus of Nola]] ''Letters'' XXXII, 139.&lt;/ref&gt; This habit might reflect a theological connection between Vulcan and the divinized Sun.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''Fetes romaine d'étè et d'automne'' Paris Gallimard 1975; It. transl. ''Feste Romane'' Genova Il Melangolo 1979 pp. 60 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another custom observed on this day required that one should start working by the light of a candle, probably to propitiate a beneficial use of fire by the god.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger ''Letters'' III, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Vulcanalia of August 23, the date of May 23, which was the second of the two annual [[Tubilustrium|Tubilustria]] or ceremonies for the purification of trumpets, was sacred to Vulcan.&lt;ref name=fowler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' [http://www.tonykline.co.uk/PITBR/Latin/OvidFastiBkFive.htm#_Toc69367933 5.725–726].&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{lang|la|[[Ludi]] Vulcanalici}}, were held just once on August 23, 20 BC, within the temple precinct of Vulcan, and used by Augustus to mark the treaty with [[Parthia]] and the return of the [[Aquila (Roman)|legionary standards]] that had been lost at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in 53 BC.

A [[flamen]], one of the {{lang|la|flamines minors}}, named {{lang|la|flamen Vulcanalis}} was in charge of the cult of the god. The flamen Vulcanalis officiated at a sacrifice to the goddess [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]], held every year at the [[Kalendae]] of May.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 12,18; Aulus Gellius ''Noctes Atticae'' XIII 23, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vulcan was among the gods placated after the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in AD 64.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0078:book=15:chapter=44 15.44.1].&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the same fire, [[Domitian]] (emperor 81–96) established a new altar to Vulcan on the [[Quirinal Hill]]. At the same time a red [[cattle|bull-calf]] and red [[boar]] were added to the sacrifices made on the Vulcanalia, at least in that region of the city.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' 4914, translated by {{cite book |author=Robert K.

==Theology==

The nature of Vulcan is connected with religious ideas concerning fire; the Roman concept of Vulcan seems to associate him to both the destructive and the fertilizing powers of fire.

In the first aspect, he is worshipped in the ''Volcanalia'', to avert its potential danger to harvested wheat. His cult is located outside the boundaries of the original city to avoid the risk of fires caused by the god in the city itself.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''Questiones Romanae'' 47; Vitruvius ''De architectura'' I,7,1&lt;/ref&gt; This power is, however, considered useful if directed against enemies and such a choice for the location of the god's cult could be interpreted in this way too. The same idea underlies the dedication of the arms of the defeated enemies,&lt;ref&gt;Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' VIII 562.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as those of the surviving general in a [[Loyalty|devotion]] ritual to the god.&lt;ref&gt;Livy ''Ab Urbe Condita Libri'' VIII 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through comparative interpretation this aspect has been connected by Dumézil to the third or defensive fire in the theory of the three Vedic sacrificial fires.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974, part 2, chap. 2; It. tr. Milan 1977 pp. 277–280.&lt;/ref&gt; In such theory three fires are necessary to the discharge of a religious ceremony: the hearth of the landlord, which has the function of establishing a referential on Earth in that precise location connecting it with Heaven; the sacrificial fire, which conveys the offer to Heaven; and the defensive fire, which is usually located on the southern boundary of the sacred space and has a protective function against evil influences. Since the territory of the city of Rome was seen as a magnified temple in itself, the three fires should be identified as the hearth of the landlord in the temple of Vesta ({{lang|la|aedes Vestae}}); the sacrificial fires of each temple, shrine or altar; and the defensive fire in the temple of Vulcan.

Another meaning of Vulcan is related to male fertilizing power. In various Latin and Roman legends he is the father of famous characters, such as the founder of [[Praeneste]] [[Caeculus]],&lt;ref&gt;Cato Censor ''Origines'' fragment 65, cited in ''Scholia Veronensia ad Aeneidem'' VII 681 p. 438, 16 ff. Hagen.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cacus]],&lt;ref&gt;Vergil ''Aeneis'' VIII 198.&lt;/ref&gt; a primordial being or king, later transformed into a monster that inhabited the site of the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] in Rome, and Roman king [[Servius Tullius]]. In a variant of the story of the birth of [[Romulus]] the details are identical even though Vulcan is not explicitly mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''Romulus'' II 3–6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pompeii - Casa dei Vettii - Ixion.jpg|thumb|Punishment of [[Ixion]]: in the center is [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] holding the [[caduceus]] and on the right [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] sits on her throne.

[[Nephele]] sits at Mercury's feet; a Roman fresco from the eastern wall of the [[triclinium]] in the [[House of the Vettii]], [[Pompeii]], [[Pompeian Styles|Fourth Style]] (60–79 AD).]]
Some scholars think that Vulcan might be the unknown god who impregnated goddesses [[Fortuna|Fortuna Primigenia]] at Praeneste and [[Feronia (goddess)|Feronia]] at [[Anxur]]. In this case, he would be the father of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Champeaux ''Fortuna, I, Fortuna dans la religion romaine archaique'' Rome, 1982; A. Mastrocinque ''Romolo. La fondazione di Roma tra storia e leggenda'' Este, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; This view, however, is in conflict with that which links the goddess to Jupiter, as his daughter ({{lang|la|puer Jovis}}) and his mother too, as {{lang|la|primigenia}}, meaning "primordial".

In all of the above-mentioned stories, the god's fertilizing power is related to that of the fire of the house hearth. In the case of Caeculus, his mother was impregnated by a spark that dropped on her womb from the hearth while she was sitting nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Vergil ''Aeneis'' VII 680.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Servius Tullius]]' mother [[Ocresia]] was impregnated by a male sex organ that miraculously appeared in the ashes of the sacrificial ara, at the order of [[Tanaquil]], [[Tarquinius Priscus]]' wife.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' VI 627.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] tells the same story, but states that the father was the [[Lares|Lar familiaris]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder ''Naturalis Historia'' XXXVI 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The divinity of the child was recognized when his head was surrounded by flames and he remained unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' VI 625–636.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the comparative analysis of these myths, archaeologist [[Andrea Carandini]] opines that [[Cacus]] and [[Caca (mythology)|Caca]] were the sons of Vulcan and of a local divine being or a virgin as in the case of Caeculus. Cacus and Caca would represent the metallurgic and the domestic fire, projections of Vulcan and of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]].

These legends date back to the time of preurban [[Latium]]. Their meaning is quite clear: at the divine level Vulcan impregnates a virgin goddess and generates Jupiter, the king of the gods; at the human level he impregnates a local virgin (perhaps of royal descent) and generates a king.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Carandini ''La nascita di Roma'' Turin, 1997, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention of a ritual connection between Vulcan and Vesta is the {{lang|la|[[lectisternium]]}} of 217 BC. Other facts that seem to hint at this connection are the relative proximity of the two sanctuaries and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]' testimony that both cults had been introduced to Rome by [[Titus Tatius]] to comply with a vow he had made in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius Halicarnasseus ''Antiquitates Romanae'' II 50, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varro]] confirms the fact.&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''Lingua Latina '' V 73: see above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vulcan is related to two equally ancient female goddesses, [[Stata Mater]],&lt;ref&gt;CIL VI, 00802, found in Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the goddess who stops fires and [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]].&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius ''Noctes Atticae'' XII 23, 2: "Maiam Volcani".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Jennings Rose]] interprets Maia as a goddess related to growth by connecting her name with IE root *MAG.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Rose ''A dictionary of classical antiquities'' It. transl., Turin, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Macrobius]] relates Cincius' opinion that Vulcan's female companion is Maia. Cincius justifies his view on the grounds that the {{lang|la|flamen Volcanalis}} sacrificed to her at the Kalendae of May. In Piso's view, the companion of the god is [[Maia (mythology)|Maiestas]].&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 12, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Gellius]] as well, Maia was associated with Vulcan; and he backs up his view by quoting the ritual prayers in use by Roman priests.&lt;ref&gt;A. Gell. ''Noct. Att.'' XIII, 23, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maiestas and Maia, though, are possibly the same divine person: compare Ovid's explanations of the meaning of the name of the month May in his ''Fasti'': V 1–52 Maiestas; 81–106 Maia both as possible eponyms of May.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vulcan is the patron of trades related to ovens (cooks, bakers, confectioners) as attested in the works of [[Plautus]],&lt;ref&gt;Plautus ''Aulularia'' 359.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apuleius]] (the god is the cook at the wedding of [[Amor and Psyche]])&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius ''Metamorphoses'' VI 24, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Vespa]]'s short poem in the [[Anthologia Latina]] about the litigation between a cook and a baker.&lt;ref&gt;''Iudicium coci et pistoris iudice Vulcano''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sons==
According to [[Hyginus]]' Fabulae, the sons of Vulcan are Philammon, [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]], [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]], Corynetes, Cercyon, Philottus, and Spinther.&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus Fabulae 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothetical origin==
The origin of the Roman god of fire Vulcan has been traced back to the Cretan god [[Velchanos]] by Gérard Capdeville, primarily under the suggestion of the close similarity of their names.&lt;ref&gt;G. Capdeville ''Volcanus. Rechérches comparatistes sur le cult de Vulcain'' Rome 1994. Reviewed by Bernard Sergent in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''216''' 1999 4 p. 475-481; Vinciane Pirenne-Delforge in ''Kernos'' 1996 '''9''' p. 434-436.&lt;/ref&gt; Cretan Velchanos is a young god of Mediterranean or Near Eastern origin who has mastership of fire and is the companion of the [[Great Goddess hypothesis|Great Goddess]]. These traits are  preserved in Latium only in his sons [[Cacus]], [[Caeculus]], and [[Servius Tullius]]. At Praeneste the uncles of Caeculus are known as Digiti,&lt;ref&gt;Solinus II 9; Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 41, 1; 43, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; a noun that connects them to the Cretan ''[[Dactyl (mythology)|Dactyl]]i''.

His theology would be reflected in the Greek myths of [[Theseus]] and the [[Minotaur]] and in those concerning the childhood of [[Zeus]] on [[Mount Ida]]. The Mediterranean Pregreek conception is apparent in the depiction of Velchanos as a young man sitting upon a fork of a tree on coins from [[Phaistos]] dating from 322 to 300 BC, showing him as a god of vegetation and springtime: the tree is the symbol of the union of Heaven and Earth and their generative power, i. e. the site of the union of the god and the goddess. Otherwise Earth would be symbolised in the tree and Heaven in the double axe of the god. Later Velchanos was depicted as a bull as testified in the myths of [[Pasiphae]] and [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]. The Greeks misunderstood the meaning of the bull as for them the symbol of Zeus was a bird: the cock, the cuckoo or the eagle. Theseus brought to [[Delos]] the dance named ''géranos'' (literally the dance of the crane) which Capdeville connects with ''Garanos'', a variant of the ''[[Recaranus]]''  of  Italic myths. B. Sergent remarks that such an inquiry needs to include the ''Tarvos Trigaranos'' (the ''bull of the three horns'') of Gaul.

In Crete, Velchanos was the god of initiatory practices of youngsters.&lt;ref&gt;G. Capdeville "Jeux athletiques et rituels de fondation" Publications de L' École Française de Rome 1993 p. 141-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reflection of the tradition of the Cretan Velchanos-Zeus would be found in [[Argolid]] in the mysteries of [[Zeus Lykaios]], which contemplated anthropophagy and may have inspired the Italic [[Lupercalia]].

The theological profile of Velchanos looks identical to that of ''[[Jupiter Dolichenus]]'', a god of primarily [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] ascendence in his identification with the bull, who has Sumero-Accadic, Aramaic and Hittito-Hurrite features as a god of tempest, according for example to the researches conducted in Syria by French scholar Paul Merlat. His cult enjoyed a period of popularity in the Roman Empire during the 2nd and 3rd centuries and the god had a temple in Rome on the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Merlat ''Jupiter Dolichenus, Essai d'intérpretation et de synthèse'' Paris PUF 1960 reviewed by [[Alfred Merlin]] "Jupiter Dolichenus" in ''Journal des savants'' 1960 '''4''' p. 160-166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation of Rome==

Velchanos was the supreme god of early Cretan religion, where the festival of the {{lang|el|βελχάνια}} (Velchania) as well as a month Ϝελχάνιοσ (Welchanios) are attested: a gloss by Hesychius states that "Velchanos is Zeus among the Cretan".&lt;ref&gt;Hesychius Γ 315 Latte.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first god of the cavern of [[Mount Ida]], where he had an oracle, and was honoured also in Cyprus.

His name is very similar to that of Latin god Volcanus, who himself was considered to be the father of [[Caeculus]] and [[Servius Tullius]], not to mention Romulus in the version transmitted by Promathion, which is very similar to the legend of Servius.

The founder of Rome has a close relationship with this god as he founded the ''Volcanal'' and there he dedicated a quadriga with his own statue  after his first victory. It is there too that a part of the tradition locates the place of his death: the site was marked by the [[Lapis Niger]]: Festus writes "Niger lapis in Comitio  locum funestum significat, ut ali, Romuli morti destinatum...". On the day of the [[Volcanalia]] (August 23) a sacrifice was offered to Hora Quirini, paredra of [[Quirinus]] with whom  the deified Romulus was identified. As the Consualia were mentioned first in connection with the founding of Rome in the episode of the abduction of the Sabine women, as the Volcanalia are celebrated two days later and two days before the ''Opiconsivia'', and as the name Volcanus resembles that of the ancient Cretan god honoured in the Βελχ?νια who presided over initiation rites, the Consualia must have a meaning of integration into the citizenship. This provides an explanation for the choice of the festival of the ''[[Parilia]] '' as the date of the foundation of Rome, since these are first of all the festival of the ''iuniores''. Festus writes: "Parilibus  Romulus Vrbem condidit, quem diem festum praecipue habebant iuniores." The date of April 21 marked the starting point of the process of initiation of the future new citizens which concluded four months later on the ceremony of the Consualia, which involves athletic games and marriages.&lt;ref&gt;G. Capdeville "Jeux athlétiques et rituels de fondation" ''Publications de l'École Française de Rome'' 1993 p. 182-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek myths of Hephaestus==

Through his identification with the [[Hephaestus]] of [[Greek mythology]], Vulcan came to be considered as the manufacturer of art, arms, [[iron]], jewelry, and armor for various gods and heroes, including the lightning bolts of Jupiter. He was the son of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], and the husband of [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]] and [[Aphrodite (mythology)|Aphrodite (Venus)]]. His [[Forge|smithy]] was believed to be situated underneath [[Mount Etna]] in [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Thomaidis|first1=Konstantinos|last2=Troll|first2=Valentin R.|last3=Deegan|first3=Frances M.|last4=Freda|first4=Carmela|last5=Corsaro|first5=Rosa A.|last6=Behncke|first6=Boris|last7=Rafailidis|first7=Savvas|date=2021|title=A message from the 'underground forge of the gods': history and current eruptions at Mt Etna|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gto.12362|journal=Geology Today|language=en|volume=37|issue=4|pages=141–149|doi=10.1111/gto.12362|s2cid=238802288 |issn=1365-2451}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Пітэр Тыз. Венера ў кузні Вулкана. XVII ст..jpg|thumb|208px|left|''Venus in the Forge of Vulcan'' by [[Pieter Thijs]]]]
As the son of Jupiter, the king of the gods, and Juno, the queen of the gods, Vulcan should have been quite handsome, but baby Vulcan was small and ugly with a red, bawling face. Juno was so horrified that she hurled the tiny baby off the top of [[Mount Olympus]].

Vulcan fell down for a day and a night, landing in the sea. Unfortunately, one of his legs broke as he hit the water, and never developed properly. Vulcan sank to the depths of the ocean,  where the sea-nymph [[Thetis]] found him and took him to her underwater grotto, wanting to raise him as her own son.

Vulcan had a happy childhood with dolphins as his playmates and pearls as his toys. Late in his childhood, he found the remains of a fisherman's fire on the beach and became fascinated with an unextinguished coal, still red-hot and glowing.

Vulcan carefully shut this precious coal in a clamshell, took it back to his underwater grotto, and made a fire with it. On the first day after that, Vulcan stared at this fire for hours on end. On the second day, he discovered that when he made the fire hotter with bellows, certain stones sweated iron, silver or gold. On the third day he beat the cooled metal into shapes: bracelets, chains, swords and shields. Vulcan made pearl-handled knives and spoons for his foster mother, and for himself he made a silver chariot with bridles so that seahorses could transport him quickly. He even made slave-girls of gold to wait on him and do his bidding.

Later, Thetis left her underwater grotto to attend a dinner party on Mount Olympus wearing a beautiful necklace of silver and sapphires that Vulcan had made for her. Juno admired the necklace and asked where she could get one. Thetis became flustered, causing Juno to become suspicious; and, at last, the queen god discovered the truth: the baby she had once rejected had grown into a talented [[blacksmith]].

[[File:Velázquez - La Fragua de Vulcano (Museo del Prado, 1630).jpg|thumb|right|''The Forge of Vulcan'' by [[Diego Velázquez]], (1630).]]

Juno was furious and demanded that Vulcan return home, a demand that he refused. However, he did send Juno a beautifully constructed chair made of silver and gold, inlaid with mother-of-pearl. Juno was delighted with this gift but, as soon as she sat in it her weight triggered hidden springs and metal bands sprung forth to hold her fast. The chair was a cleverly designed trap. It was [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] who finally saved the day: he promised that if Vulcan released Juno he would give him a wife, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] the goddess of love and beauty. Vulcan agreed and married Venus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/HephaistosLoves.html#Aphrodite |title=Hephaestus and Aphrodite |website=theoi.com/Olympios/HephaistosLoves.html#aphrodite |access-date=December 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vulcan later built a smithy under [[Mount Etna]] on the island of [[Sicily]]. It was said that whenever Venus was unfaithful, Vulcan grew angry and beat the red-hot metal with such a force that sparks and smoke rose up from the top of the mountain, creating a volcanic eruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Vulcan|url=https://mythopedia.com/roman-mythology/gods/vulcan/|access-date=2021-03-24|website=Mythopedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Virgil]], Vulcan was the father of [[Caeculus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Verg.+A.+7.678 7.678–681]; [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] on ''Aeneid'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Serv.+A.+7.678&amp;fromdoc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0053 7.678].&lt;/ref&gt;

To punish mankind for stealing the secrets of fire, Jupiter ordered the other gods to make a poisoned gift for man. Vulcan's contribution to the beautiful and foolish [[Pandora]] was to mould her from clay and to give her form. He also made the thrones for the other gods on [[Mount Olympus]].

==Sanctuaries==
The main and most ancient sanctuary of Vulcan in Rome was the ''Volcanal'', located in the ''area Volcani'', an open-air space at the foot of the [[Capitolium]], in the northwestern corner of the [[Roman Forum]], with an area dedicated to the god and a perennial fire. It was one of the most ancient Roman shrines.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. above note 10, 11 and 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Roman tradition the sanctuary had been dedicated by [[Romulus]]. He had placed on the site a bronze [[quadriga]] dedicated to the god, a war trophy from the [[Fidenates]]. According to Plutarch, though, the war in question was that against [[Cameria]], that occurred sixteen years after the foundation of Rome.&lt;ref name="Plutarch Romulus 24"&gt;Plutarch ''Romulus'' 24.&lt;/ref&gt; There Romulus would have also dedicated to Vulcan a statue of himself and an inscription in Greek characters listing  his successes.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antitquitites'' II 54, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch states that Romulus was represented crowned by [[Victory (mythology)|Victory]].&lt;ref name="Plutarch Romulus 24"/&gt; Moreover, he would have planted a sacred lotus tree&lt;ref&gt;The Italic lotus, ''diospyrus lotus'', or ''melilotus'', [[Columella]]  ''De Re Rustica'' VII 9; [[Galen]].&lt;/ref&gt; in the sanctuary that was still living at the time of [[Pliny the Elder]] and was said to be as old as the city.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder ''Naturalis Historia'' XVI 236.&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis has been presented that the ''Volcanal'' was founded when the Forum was still outside the town walls.&lt;ref name="G. Dumézil p. 285"&gt;G. Dumézil ''La religione romana arcaica'' Milano Rizzoli 1977 p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Volcanal'' was perhaps used as a cremation site, as suggested by the early use of the Forum as a burial site.&lt;ref&gt;Von Duhn ''Altitalische Gräberkunde'' as cited by Samuel Ball Platner &amp; Thomas Ashby''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' London 1928 p. 583-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Livy mentions it twice, in 189 and 181 BC, for the prodigies of a rain of blood.&lt;ref&gt;Livy Ab Urbe Condita Libri XL 19, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The ''area Volcani'' was probably a ''locus substructus''. It was five meters higher than the [[Comitium]]&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Antiquitates  Romanae'' II 50, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and from it the kings and the magistrates of the beginnings of the republic addressed the people, before the building of the [[rostra]].&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Antiquitates  Romanae'' XI 39, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Volcanal there was also a statue of [[Horatius Cocles]]&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''Publicola'', 16&lt;/ref&gt; that had been moved here from the [[Comitium]], ''locus inferior'', after it had been struck by lightning. [[Aulus Gellius]] writes that some [[haruspices]] were summoned to expiate the prodigy and they had it moved to a lower site, where sunlight never reached, out of their hatred for the Romans. The fraud was revealed, however, and the haruspices were executed. Later it was found that the statue should be placed on a higher site, thus it was placed in the ''area Volcani''.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius ''Noct. Att.'' IV, 5; Gellius writes that the episode was recorded in the XI book of the [[Annales Maximi]] and by [[Verrius Flaccus]] ''Memorabilia'' I.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 304 BC a sacellum to [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]] was built in the ''area Volcani'': it was dedicated by [[aedilis]] curulis [[Cnaeus Flavius]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy ''Ab Urbe Condita Libri'' IX 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Samuel Ball Platner]], in the course of time the  ''Volcanal'' would have been more and more encroached upon by the surrounding buildings until it was totally covered over. Nonetheless the cult was still alive in the first half of the imperial era, as is testified by the finding of a dedica of Augustus's dating from 9 BC.&lt;ref&gt;CIL VI 457.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, behind the [[Arch of Septimius Severus]] were found some ancient tufaceous foundations that probably belonged to the Volcanal and traces of a rocky platform, 3.95 meters long and 2.80 meters wide, that had been covered with concrete and painted in red. Into its upper surface are dug several narrow channels and in front of it are the remains of a draining channel made of tufaceous slabs. The hypothesis has been suggested that this was Vulcan's ''area'' itself. The rock shows signs of damages and repairs. On the surface there are some hollows, either round or square, that bear resemblance to graves and were interpreted as such in the past,&lt;ref&gt;Richter BRT iv 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly by [[Von Duhn]]. After the discovery of cremation tombs in the Forum the latter scholar maintained that the Volcanal was originally the site where corpses were cremated.&lt;ref&gt;Von Duhn ''Italische Gräberkunde'' i. 413 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another temple was erected to the god before 215 BC in the [[Campus Martius]], near the [[Circus Flaminius]], where games in his honour were held during the festival of the Volcanalia.&lt;ref name="G. Dumézil p. 285"/&gt;

==Outside Rome==
At [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] the cult of the god, as well as his ''sacerdos'', was the most important of the town. The sacerdos was named ''pontifex Vulcani et aedium sacrarum'': he had under his jurisdiction all the sacred buildings in town and could give or withhold the authorisation to erect new statues to Eastern divinities. He was chosen for life, perhaps by the council of the ''decuriones'', and his position was the equivalent of the [[pontifex maximus]] in Rome. It was the highest administrative position in the town of Ostia.

He was selected from among people who had already held public office in Ostia or in the imperial administration. The pontifex was the sole authority who had a number of subordinate officials to help discharge his duties, namely three ''praetores'' and two or three ''aediles''. These were religious offices, different from civil offices of similar name.&lt;ref&gt;C. Pavolini ''La vita quotidiana a Ostia'' Roma-Bari,1986&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[Strabon]]&lt;ref&gt;Strabone ''Geografia. L'Italia'' V,4,6, Milan 1988&lt;/ref&gt; we know that at Pozzuoli there was an area called in Greek ''agora' of Hephaistos'' (Lat. Forum Vulcani). The place is a plain where many sulphurous vapour outlets are located (currently ''Solfatara'').

Pliny the Elder records that near [[Modena]] fire came out from soil ''statis Vulcano  diebus'', on fixed days devoted to Vulcan.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder ''Nat. Hist.'' II, 240&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1561 v. Heemskerck Momus tadelt die Werke der Goetter.JPG|thumb|upright=1.6|''Momus Criticizes the Gods' Creations'', by [[Maarten van Heemskerck]], 1561, [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]]]
'''Momus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oʊ|m|ə|s}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Μῶμος ''Momos'') in [[Greek mythology]] was the personification of [[satire]] and mockery, two stories about whom figure among [[Aesop's Fables]]. During the [[Renaissance]], several literary works used him as a mouthpiece for their criticism of tyranny, while others later made him a critic of contemporary society. Onstage he finally became the figure of harmless fun.

== In classical literature ==
{{Greek myth (personified)}}
As a sharp-tongued spirit of unfair criticism, Momus was eventually expelled from the company of the gods on [[Greek mythology#Greek pantheon|Mount Olympus]]. His name is related to {{lang|grc|μομφή}}, meaning 'blame', 'reproach', or 'disgrace'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=%CE%9C%E1%BF%B6%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%82&amp;la=greek#lexicon|title=Greek Word Study Tool|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=August 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hesiod]] said that Momus was a son of Night ([[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]]), "though she lay with none", and the twin of the misery goddess [[Oizys]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/theogony.htm ''Theogony'' 214]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century BCE epic ''[[Cypria]]'', Momus was credited with stirring up the [[Trojan War]] in order to reduce the human population.&lt;ref&gt;David Marsh, ''Lucian and the Latins'', University of Michigan 1998, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sLXWYW32neQC&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;ots=bG1XrPYgRy&amp;dq=Cypria%20%20%22Momus%22&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q=Cypria%20%20%22Momus%22&amp;f=false p.116]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sophocles]] wrote a later [[satyr play]] called ''Momos'', now almost entirely lost, which may have derived from this.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Ferris Sutton, "A handlist of satyr plays", ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' vo.78 (1974), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VyX-xjSHMmcC&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;ots=8mpeL2Bxgy&amp;dq=Momos%20%20Sophocles&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q=Momos%20%20Sophocles&amp;f=false p.112]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of [[Aesop's fables]] feature the god. The most widely reported of these in Classical times is numbered 100 in the [[Perry Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/100.htm|title=MOMUS AND THE GODS|website=mythfolklore.net|access-date=August 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; There Momus is asked to judge the handiwork of three gods (who vary depending on the version): a man, a house and a bull. He found all at fault: the man because his heart was not on view to judge his thoughts; the house because it had no wheels so as to avoid troublesome neighbours; and the bull because it did not have eyes in its horns to guide it when charging.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francisco Rodríguez Adrados]], ''History of the Graeco-latin Fable'', Vol.3, Brill NL 2003, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BHScT2Dd3ykC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q=Momus&amp;f=false pp.131-3]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of it, [[Plutarch]] and [[Aristotle]] criticized Aesop's story-telling as deficient in understanding, while [[Lucian]] insisted that anyone with sense was able to sound out a man's thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;''Hermotimus or the Rival Philosophies'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl2/wl205.htm p.52]&lt;/ref&gt;

As another result, Momus became a by-word for fault-finding, and the saying that if not even he could criticize something then that was the sign of its perfection. Thus a poem in the [[Greek Anthology]] remarks of statues by [[Praxiteles]] that "Momus himself will cry out, 'Father Zeus, this was perfect skill'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/greek_anthology_16/1918/pb_LCL086.315.xml|title=The Greek Anthology 16|first=Jeffrey|last=Henderson|website=Loeb Classical Library|access-date=August 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking the lovely Aphrodite over, according to a second fable of Aesop's, number 455 in the Perry Index, it was light-heartedly noted that he could not find anything about her to fault except that her sandals squeaked.&lt;ref&gt;Adrados, pp.512-3&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clearleft}}

==Political satire==
In [[Lucian]]'s 2nd-century social comedy ''[[The Gods in Council]]'', Momus takes a leading role in a discussion on how to purge Olympus of foreign gods and barbarian demi-gods who are lowering its heavenly tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl4/wl430.htm|title=Works of Lucian, Vol. IV: The Gods in Council|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=August 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renaissance author [[Leon Battista Alberti]] wrote the political work ''Momus, or The Prince'' (1446), which continued the god's story after his exile to earth. Since his continued criticism of the gods was destabilizing the divine establishment, Jupiter bound him to a rock and had him [[Castration|castrated]]. Later, however, missing his candor, Jupiter sought out a manuscript that Momus had left behind in which was described how a land could be ruled with strictly regulated justice.&lt;ref&gt;David Cast, "Marten van Heemskerck's 'Momus criticizing the work of the gods': a problem of Erasmian iconography. ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', Volume 7.1 (1974), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=88_3CAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA28 pp.25]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 16th century, [[Erasmus]] also presented Momus as a champion of the legitimate criticism of authorities. Allowing that the god was "not quite as popular as others, because few people freely admit criticism, yet I dare say of the whole crowd of gods celebrated by the poets, none was more useful."&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Mann Phillips, ''The Adages of Erasmus: A Study with Translations'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EDg9AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA34 pp.34-5]&lt;/ref&gt; Giordano Bruno's philosophical treatise ''The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast'' (1584)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spaccio della bestia trionfante. Or the Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast |translator=William Morehead |location=London |year=1713 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ggJeAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP7|last1=Bruno |first1=Giordano }}&lt;/ref&gt; also looks back to Lucian's example. Momus there plays an integral part in the series of dialogues conducted by the Olympian deities and Bruno's narrators as Jupiter seeks to purge the universe of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Henry Popkin |title=The Columbia History of Western Philosophy |publisher=Columbia University |year=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TE021UmMiAsC&amp;pg=PA321 |pages=320–321|isbn=9780231500340 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social satire==
17th-century English writers introduced the figure of Momus in a gentler spirit of fun, as in [[Thomas Carew]]'s masque ''Coelum Britannicum'' (1634), which was acted before King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and his court. In ''Coelum Britannicum'', Momus and Mercury draw up a plan to reform the "[[Star Chamber]]" of Heaven. Two centuries later, ''Coelum Britannicum'' influenced [[Henry David Thoreau]]{{how|date=February 2022}} as he was preparing to write his ''[[Walden]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Grey, ''The Complicity of Imagination: The American Renaissance, Contests of Authority, and Seventeenth-Century English Culture'', Cambridge University 2009, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2E8joaumCnsC&amp;pg=PA135 pp.133-136]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Dryden]]'s short "Secular Masque" (1700) mocks contemporary society through the medium of the Classical divinities, with Momus playing a leading part in deflating with sarcastic wit the sports represented by Diana (hunting), Mars (war), and Venus (love), for "'Tis better to laugh than to cry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://britlitwiki.wikispaces.com/The+Secular+Masque|title=Wikispaces|website=britlitwiki.wikispaces.com|access-date=August 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is with similar wryness that [[Carl Sandburg]]'s statue of "Momus" (1914) surveys the never-changing human scene, "On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history", as they continue to overpopulate the world and then bleed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/12847/momus|title=Momus by Carl Sandburg|first=Poetry|last=Magazine|date=August 31, 2019|website=Poetry Foundation|access-date=August 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedy==
[[File:Momus Tarot.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|"The Fool" (Momus), on an 18th-century playing card|left]]
Elsewhere in Europe, Momus was becoming softened into a figure of light-hearted and sentimental comedy, the equivalent of [[Harlequin]] in the French and Italian ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Derek F. Connon, ''Identity and Transformation in the Plays of Alexis Piron'', London 2007, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w36s4EjIPdMC&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;ots=0xXvbubEwU&amp;dq=momus%20theatre&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q=momus%20theatre&amp;f=false pp.125-6]&lt;/ref&gt; A typical production has him competing for the amorous favours of a nymph in [[Henry Desmarets]]' opéra-ballet ''Les amours de Momus'' (1695).&lt;ref&gt;French language outline [http://operabaroque.fr/DESMAREST_MOMUS.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

By this period, Momus was the patron of humorous satire, partnering the figures of [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]]. As such he appeared flanked by these female figures on the frontispiece to ''The Beauties of the English Stage'' (1737),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=840180001&amp;objectId=3287471&amp;partId=1|title=Image gallery: print / frontispiece|website=British Museum|access-date=August 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Leonard Defraine's ''Figures of Fabled Gods'' (1820), he partners [[Comus]], god of [[Carnival]], and [[Themis]], patroness of assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allposters.com/-sp/Comus-Themis-and-Momus-Greek-Gods-Posters_i10656207_.htm|title=Comus, Themis and Momus, Greek Gods Giclee Print by Leonard Defraine at AllPosters.com|website=AllPosters.com|access-date=August 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the Harlequin connection, and as the character able to make home-truths palatable through the use of humour, Momus had now taken the place of the [[Jester|Fool]] on a French [[Minchiate]] card pack. He also lent his name to [[George Saville Carey]]'s satirical poem, ''Momus, or a critical examination into the merits of the performers and comic pieces at the Theatre-Royal in the Hay-Market'' (1767).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/004807208.0001.000|title=Momus, a poem; or a critical examination into the merits of the performers, and comic pieces, at the Theatre-Royal in the Hay-Market|first=George Saville|last=Carey|date=September 30, 2008|access-date=August 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The god himself plays no part there, only "Momus' sons," the comic actors.

{{ancient Roman religion}}

The Roman deities most widely known today are those the Romans identified with Greek counterparts (see ''[[interpretatio graeca]]''), integrating [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]], [[ancient Greek art|iconography]], and sometimes [[Religion in ancient Greece|religious practices]] into [[ancient Roman culture|Roman culture]], including [[Latin literature]], [[ancient Roman art|Roman art]], and [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious life]] as it was experienced throughout the [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. Many of the Romans' own gods remain obscure, known only by name and sometimes function, through inscriptions and texts that are often fragmentary. This is particularly true of those gods belonging to the archaic religion of the Romans dating back to the [[Roman Kingdom|era of kings]], the so-called "religion of [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]]", which was perpetuated or revived over the centuries. Some archaic deities have [[Italic peoples|Italic]] or [[Etruscan religion|Etruscan counterparts]], as identified both by ancient sources and by modern scholars. Throughout the Empire, the deities of peoples in the [[Roman province|provinces]] were given new theological interpretations in light of functions or attributes they shared with Roman deities.

An extensive alphabetical list follows a survey of theological groups as constructed by the Romans themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "Roman Gods," ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), pp. 75 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uf2_kHAs22sC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22The+following+is+a+summary+of+the+different+groupings+of+deities+in+Rome%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Cfz0TN3eGIf9nAePv4npCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20following%20is%20a%20summary%20of%20the%20different%20groupings%20of%20deities%20in%20Rome%22&amp;f=false online] and 77 (note 49). Unless otherwise noted, citations of primary sources are Schilling's.&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cultus|cult]] pertaining to deified [[Roman emperor]]s ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#divus|divi]])'', see [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Titles and honorifics==
Certain honorifics and titles could be shared by different gods, divine [[personification]]s, demi-gods and ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#divus|divi]]'' (deified mortals).

===''Augustus'' and ''Augusta''===
''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'', "the elevated or august one" ([[grammatical gender|masculine]] form) is an honorific and title awarded to [[Octavian]] in recognition of his unique status, the extraordinary range of his powers, and the apparent divine approval of his [[principate]]. After his death and deification, the title was awarded to each of his successors. It also became a near ubiquitous title or honour for various minor local deities, including the ''[[Lares#Lares and their domains|Lares Augusti]]'' of local communities, and obscure provincial deities such as the [[Africa (Roman province)|North African]] ''Marazgu Augustus''. This extension of an Imperial honorific to major and minor deities of Rome and her provinces is considered a ground-level feature of [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]].

''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'', the feminine form, is an honorific and title associated with the development and dissemination of Imperial cult as applied to [[Roman Empress]]es, whether living, deceased or deified as ''divae''. The first Augusta was [[Livia]], wife of [[Octavian]], and the title is then shared by various state goddesses including [[Bona Dea]], [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Minerva]], and [[Ops]]; by many minor or local goddesses; and by the female personifications of Imperial virtues such as [[Pax (mythology)|Pax]] and [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]].

===''Bonus'' and ''Bona''===
The [[epithet]] ''Bonus'', "the Good," is used in Imperial ideology with abstract deities such as ''Bona Fortuna'' ("Good Fortune"), ''Bona Mens'' ("Good Thinking" or "Sound Mind"), and ''[[Spes|Bona Spes]]'' ("Valid Hope," perhaps to be translated as "Optimism"). During the Republic, the epithet may be most prominent with [[Bona Dea]], "the Good Goddess" whose rites were celebrated by women. [[Bonus Eventus]], "Good Outcome", was one of Varro's twelve agricultural deities, and later represented success in general.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik H.J. Brouwer, ''Bona Dea: The Sources and a Description of the Cult'' pp. 245–246.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Isis - Vienna.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.5|Roman Isis in black and white marble, from the time of [[Apuleius]]]]

===''Caelestis''===
From the middle Imperial period, the title ''Caelestis'', "Heavenly" or "Celestial" is attached to several goddesses embodying aspects of a single, supreme Heavenly Goddess. {{Citation needed|date=October 2022}} The ''Dea Caelestis'' was identified with the [[Virgo (constellation)|constellation Virgo]] ("The Virgin"), who holds the [[Libra (constellation)|divine balance of justice]]. In the ''[[The Golden Ass|Metamorphoses]]'' of [[Apuleius]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Apuleius]], ''[[The Golden Ass|Metamorphoses]]'' 11.2.&lt;/ref&gt; the protagonist Lucius prays to the Hellenistic Egyptian goddess [[Isis]] as ''Regina Caeli'', "[[Queen of heaven (antiquity)|Queen of Heaven]]", who is said to manifest also as Ceres, "the original nurturing parent"; Heavenly Venus ''(Venus Caelestis)''; the "sister of [[Phoebus]]", that is, Diana or [[Artemis]] as she is [[Temple of Artemis|worshipped at Ephesus]]; or [[Proserpina]] as the triple goddess of the underworld. [[Juno (mythology)#Epithets|Juno Caelestis]] was the Romanised form of the Carthaginian [[Tanit]].&lt;ref&gt;Benko, Stephen, ''The virgin goddess: studies in the pagan and Christian roots of mariology,'' Brill, 2004, pp. 112–114: see also pp. 31, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grammatically, the form ''Caelestis'' can also be a masculine word, but the equivalent function for a male deity is usually expressed through [[syncretism|syncretization]] with [[Caelus]], as in ''Caelus Aeternus Iuppiter,'' "Jupiter the Eternal Sky."

===''Invictus''===
[[File:Römermuseum Osterburken (DerHexer) 2012-09-30 032.jpg|thumb|Dedication made to the ''Deus Invictus'' by a [[Roman legionary]] in [[Brigetio]], [[Pannonia]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 03, 11008"A soldier of the [[Legio I Adiutrix]] [dedicated this] to the Unconquered God" ''(Deo Invicto / Ulpius Sabinus / miles legio/nis primae / (A)diutricis)''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''''Invictus'' ("Unconquered, Invincible")''' was in use as a divine epithet by the early 3rd century BC. In the Imperial period, it expressed the invincibility of deities embraced officially, such as Jupiter, Mars, [[Hercules in ancient Rome|Hercules]], and [[Sol Invictus|Sol]]. On coins, calendars, and other inscriptions, Mercury, Saturn, [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]], [[Fontus|Fons]], [[Serapis]], [[Sabazius]], Apollo, and the Genius are also found as ''Invictus.'' Cicero considers it a normal epithet for Jupiter, in regard to whom it is probably a synonym for ''Omnipotens''. It is also used in the [[Mithraic mysteries]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Ernst Hijmans, ''Sol: The Sun in the Art and Religions of Rome'' (diss., University of Groningen 2009), p. 18, with citations from the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mater'' and ''Pater''===
''Mater'' ("Mother") was an honorific that respected a goddess's maternal authority and functions, and not necessarily "motherhood" per se. Early examples included [[Terra Mater]] (Mother Earth) and the [[Mother of the Lares|Mater Larum]] (Mother of the [[Lares]]). [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], a goddess of chastity usually conceived of as a virgin, was honored as ''Mater''. A goddess known as [[Stata Mater]] was a [[compitalia|compital]] deity credited with preventing fires in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the middle Imperial era, the reigning Empress becomes ''Mater castrorum et senatus et patriae'', the symbolic Mother of military camps, the [[Roman senate|senate]], and the fatherland. The Gallic and Germanic cavalry ''([[auxilia]])'' of the Roman Imperial army regularly set up altars to the "Mothers of the Field" (''Campestres'', from ''campus'', "field," with the title [[Matres and Matrones|''Matres'' or ''Matronae'']]).&lt;ref&gt;R.W. Davies, "The Training Grounds of the Roman Cavalry," ''Archaeological Journal'' 125 (1968), p. 73 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[#Magna Mater|Magna Mater]] (Great Mother) following.

Gods were called ''Pater'' ("Father") to signify their preeminence and paternal care, and the [[pietas|filial respect]] owed to them. ''Pater'' was found as an epithet of [[Dis Pater|Dis]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Mars (mythology)#Mars Pater|Mars]], and [[Liber Pater|Liber]], among others.

====Magna Mater====
"The Great Mother" was a title given to [[Cybele]] in her Roman cult. Some Roman literary sources accord the same title to [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]] and other goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.12.16–33. Cited in H.H.J. Brouwer, ''Bona Dea: The Sources and a Description of the Cult'' (Brill, 1989), pp. 240, 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collectives==
Even in [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#invocatio|invocations]], which generally required precise naming, the Romans sometimes spoke of gods as groups or collectives rather than naming them as individuals. Some groups, such as the [[Camenae]] and [[Parcae]], were thought of as a limited number of individual deities, even though the number of these might not be given consistently in all periods and all texts. The following groups, however, are numberless collectives.

===Spatial tripartition===
Varro grouped the gods broadly into three divisions of heaven, earth, and underworld:
* ''di superi'', the gods above or heavenly gods, whose altars were designated as ''altaria''.&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''Divine Antiquities,'' book 5, frg. 65; see also Livy 1.32.9; Paulus apud Festus, p. 27; [[Servius Danielis]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 5.54; Lactantius Placidus, note to Statius, Theb. 4.459–60.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''di terrestres'', "terrestrial gods," whose altars were designated as ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ara|arae]].''
* ''[[di inferi]]'', the gods below, that is, the gods of the underworld, infernal or [[chthonic]] gods, whose altars were ''foci'', [[fire pit]]s or specially constructed hearths.

More common is a dualistic contrast between ''superi'' and ''inferi''.

===''Di indigetes'' and ''novensiles''===
The ''[[di indigetes]]'' were thought by [[Georg Wissowa]] to be Rome's indigenous deities, in contrast to the [[Novensiles|''di novensides'' or ''novensiles'']], "newcomer gods". No ancient source, however, poses this dichotomy, which is not generally accepted among scholars of the 21st century. The meaning of the epithet ''indiges'' (singular) has no scholarly consensus, and ''noven'' may mean "nine" ''(novem)'' rather than "new".

==Roman god lists==

===Triads===
* [[Archaic Triad]]: [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Quirinus]].
* [[Capitoline Triad]]: Jupiter, [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Minerva]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], 1.38.7, 1.55.1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aventine Triad|Plebeian or Aventine Triad]]: [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], [[Liber]], [[Libera (mythology)|Libera]], dating to 493 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] 6.17.2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groupings of twelve===

====Lectisternium of 217 BC====
A [[lectisternium]] is a banquet for the gods, at which they appear as images seated on couches, as if present and participating. In describing the lectisternium of the Twelve Great gods in 217 BC, the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] [[Roman historiography|historian]] [[Livy]] places the deities in gender-balanced pairs:&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 22.10.9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]–[[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]
*[[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]–[[Minerva]]
*[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]–[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]
*[[Apollo]]–[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]
*[[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]–[[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]
*[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]–[[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]
Divine male-female complements such as these, as well as the [[anthropomorphic]] influence of Greek mythology, contributed to a tendency in Latin literature to represent the gods as "married" couples or (as in the case of Venus and Mars) lovers.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[File:Altar twelve gods Louvre Ma666.jpg|thumb|''Di Consentes'' on an altar]]

====''Dii Consentes''====
[[Varro]] uses the name ''[[Dii Consentes]]'' for twelve deities whose gilded images stood in the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]]. These were also placed in six male-female pairs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''De re rustica'' 1.1.4: "eos urbanos, quorum imagines ad forum auratae stant, sex mares et feminae totidem.''&lt;/ref&gt; Although individual names are not listed, they are assumed to be the deities of the lectisternium. A fragment from [[Ennius]], within whose lifetime the lectisternium occurred, lists the same twelve deities by name, though in a different order from that of Livy: ''Juno, Vesta, Minerva, Ceres, Diana, Venus, Mars, Mercurius, Jove, Neptunus, Vulcanus, Apollo.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ennius]], ''Annales'' frg. 62, in J. Vahlen, ''Ennianae Poesis Reliquiae'' (Leipzig, 1903, 2nd ed.). Ennius's list appears in poetic form, and the word order may be dictated by the metrical constraints of [[dactylic hexameter]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dii Consentes'' are sometimes seen as the Roman equivalent of the Greek [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]]. The meaning of ''Consentes'' is subject to interpretation, but is usually taken to mean that they form a council or consensus of deities.

{{div col end}}

[[File:Livia statue.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Livia]], wife of [[Augustus]], dressed as the goddess [[Ops]].]]
Elsewhere, Varro claims [[Sol Indiges]] – who had a [[sacred grove]] at [[Lavinium]] – as Sabine but at the same time equates him with [[Apollo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Varro]] |title=De lingua latina |at=5.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rehak, Paul (2006). ''Imperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the northern Campus Martius''. University of Wisconsin Press. p 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Of those listed, he writes, "several names have their roots in both languages, as trees that grow on a property line creep into both fields. Saturn, for instance, can be said to have another origin here, and so too Diana."&lt;ref&gt;''e quis nonnulla nomina in utraque lingua habent radices, ut arbores quae in confinio natae in utroque agro serpunt: potest enim Saturnus hic de alia causa esse dictus atque in Sabinis, et sic Diana.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Varro makes various claims for Sabine origins throughout his works, some more plausible than others, and his list should not be taken at face value.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Anna. (2007). ''Divine Qualities: Cult and community in republican Rome''. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. pp 37–38;&lt;br /&gt;[[Emma Dench|Dench, Emma]]. (2005). ''Romulus' Asylum: Roman Identities from the Age of Alexander to the Age of Hadrian''. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. pp 317–318.&lt;/ref&gt; But the importance of the Sabines in the early cultural formation of Rome is evidenced, for instance, by the [[Rape of the Sabine Women|bride abduction of the Sabine women]] by [[Romulus]]'s men, and in the Sabine ethnicity of [[Numa Pompilius]], second [[king of Rome]], to whom are attributed many of Rome's religious and legal institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler|Fowler, W.W.]] (1922). ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People''. London, UK. p 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Varro, however, says that the altars to most of these gods were established at Rome by [[Titus Tatius|King Tatius]] as the result of a vow (''[[votum]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Tatius is said by Varro to have dedicated altars to "[[Ops]], [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]], [[Vejovis|Vediovis]], and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]; to [[Sol (Roman mythology)|Sol]], [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], [[Vulcan (god)|Vulcan]], and [[Summanus]]; and likewise to [[Larunda]], [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], [[Quirinus]], [[Vertumnus|Vortumnus]], the [[Lares]], [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]], and [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Indigitamenta''===
{{Main|Indigitamenta}}
The ''indigitamenta'' are deities known only or primarily as a name; they may be minor entities, or epithets of major gods. Lists of deities were kept by the [[College of Pontiffs]] to assure that the correct names were invoked for public prayers. The [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#libri pontificales|books of the Pontiffs]] are lost, known only through scattered passages in [[Latin literature]]. The most extensive lists are provided by the [[Church Fathers]] who sought systematically to debunk Roman religion while drawing on the theological works of Varro, also surviving only in quoted or referenced fragments. [[Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher|W.H. Roscher]] collated the standard modern list of ''indigitamenta'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher|W.H. Roscher]], ''Ausführliches Lexikon der griechischen und römischen Mythologie'' (Leipzig: Teubner, 1890–94), vol. 2, pt. 1, pp. 187–233.&lt;/ref&gt; though other scholars may differ with him on some points.

* '''[[Aius Locutius]]''', divine voice that warned the Romans of the imminent [[Gauls|Gallic]] invasion.
* '''[[Alernus]]''' or '''Elernus''' (possibly '''Helernus'''), an archaic god whose sacred grove ''([[lucus]])'' was near the [[Tiber river]]. He is named definitively only by [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Fasti'' 2.67 and 6.105 (1988 Teubner edition).&lt;/ref&gt; The grove was the birthplace of the nymph [[Cardea]], and despite the obscurity of the god, the [[College of Pontiffs|state priests]] still carried out sacred rites ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacra|sacra]])'' there in the time of [[Augustus]].&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' 6.106.&lt;/ref&gt; Alernus may have been a [[chthonic]] god, if a black ox was the correct sacrificial offering to him, since dark [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|victims]] were offered to underworld gods.&lt;ref&gt;This depends on a proposed [[textual criticism|emendation]] of ''Aternus'' to ''Alernus'' in an entry from [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], p. 83 in the edition of Lindsay. At ''Fasti'' 2.67, a reading of [[Avernus]], though possible, makes no geographical sense. See discussion of this deity by Matthew Robinson, ''A Commentary on Ovid's'' Fasti'', Book 2'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dumézil]] wanted to make him a god of beans.&lt;ref&gt;As noted by Robinson, ''Commentary'', p. 101; [[Georges Dumézil]], ''Fêtes romaines d'été et d'automne'' (1975), pp. 225ff., taking the name as ''Helernus'' in association with Latin ''holus, holera'', "vegetables." The risks and "excessive fluidity" inherent in Dumézil's reconstructions of lost mythologies were noted by Robert Schilling, "The Religion of the Roman Republic: A Review of Recent Studies," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'', pp. 87–88, and specifically in regard to the myth of [[Cardea|Carna]] as a context for the supposed Helernus.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman mythology|myth]], '''Janus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|eɪ|n|ə|s}} {{respell|JAY|nəs}}; {{lang-la|Ianvs}} {{IPA-la|ˈi̯aːnʊs|}}) is the [[List of Roman deities|god]] of beginnings, gates, transitions, time, duality, doorways,&lt;ref&gt;Varro apud Augustine ''De Civitate Dei'' VII 9 and 3; Servius ''Aen.'' I 449; Paulus ex Festus s. v. Chaos p. 45 L&lt;/ref&gt; passages, frames, and endings. He is usually depicted as having two faces. The month of January is named for Janus (''[[Ianuarius]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''Time in Roman Religion'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ancient Roman farmers' almanacs, [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] was mistaken as the [[tutelary deity]] of the month of January,&lt;ref&gt;[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; but Juno is the tutelary deity of the month of June.

Janus presided over the beginning and ending of conflict, and hence war and peace. The gates of a building in Rome named after him (not a temple, as it is often called, but an open enclosure with gates at each end) were opened in time of war, and closed to mark the arrival of peace. As a god of transitions, he had functions pertaining to [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|birth]] and to journeys and exchange, and in his association with [[Portunus (mythology)|Portunus]], a similar harbor and gateway god, he was concerned with travelling, trading and shipping.

Janus had no [[flamen]] or specialised priest ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sacerdos]])'' assigned to him, but the King of the Sacred Rites ''([[rex sacrorum]])'' himself carried out his ceremonies. Janus had a ubiquitous presence in religious ceremonies throughout the year. As such, Janus was ritually invoked at the beginning of each ceremony, regardless of the main deity honored on any particular occasion.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

While the [[religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] had no known [[interpretatio graeca|equivalent]] to Janus, there is considerate overlap with [[culsans|Culśanś]] of the Etruscan pantheon.

== Name ==

=== Etymology ===
The name of the god ''Iānus'', meaning in [[Latin]] 'arched passage, doorway', stems from [[Proto-Italic language|Proto-Italic]] ''*iānu'' ('door'), ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*ieh₂nu'' ('passage'). It is cognate with [[Sanskrit]] ''yāti'' ('to go, travel'), [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''jóti'' ('to go, ride'), [[Irish language|Irish]] ''áth'' ('[[Ford (crossing)|ford]]') or [[Serbo-Croatian]] ''jàhati'' ('to ride').{{Sfn|de Vaan|2008|p=294}}&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Rabun, "Watching the Skies: Janus, Auspication, and the Shrine in the Roman Forum," ''Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome'' vol. 45 (2000): p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iānus would then be an action name expressing the idea of going, passing, formed on the root *yā- &lt; *y-eð&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;- theme II of the root *ey- go from which eō, ειμι.&lt;ref&gt;Objections by A. Meillet and A. Ernout to this etymology have been rejected by most French scholars: É. Benveniste, R. Schilling, G.  Dumezil, G. Capdeville. The enlargement of root *ey- into *ya- is well represented in Western Indo-European, as e. g. in Irish āth ,*yā-tu-s ford: cf. J Pokorny ''Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch'' I Berne-Munich 1959 p. 296 s. v. i̯ā and ''Thesaurus Linguae Latinae'' s. v. ianus.&lt;/ref&gt; Other modern scholars object to an [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] etymology either from Dianus or from root *yā-.&lt;ref&gt;A. Meillet DELL s.v. Ianus; A. Ernout "Consus, Ianus, Sancus" in ''Philologica II'' 1957 p. 175: Ernout takes into consideration the legends of the Thessalic origin of Janus too.&lt;/ref&gt;

From ''Ianus'' derived ''ianua'' ("door"),&lt;ref&gt;F. Altheim History of Roman Religion London 1938 p. 194; V. Basanoff Les dieux des Romains Paris 1942 p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and hence the English word "janitor" (Latin, ''ianitor'').

=== Ancient interpretations ===
Three etymologies were proposed by ancient erudites, each of them bearing implications about the nature of the god.&lt;ref&gt;G. Capdeville "Les épithètes cultuelles de Janus" in ''MEFRA'' '''85''' 2 1973 p . 399.&lt;/ref&gt; The first one is based on the definition of Chaos given by [[Paul the Deacon]]: ''hiantem'', ''hiare'', "be open", from which the word ''Ianus'' would derive by the loss of the initial aspirate. In this etymology, the notion of Chaos would define the primordial nature of the god.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus above : "Chaos appellabat Hesiodus confusam quondam ab initio unitatem, hiantem patentemque in profundum. Ex eo et χάσκειν Graeci, et nos ''hiare'' dicimus. Unde Ianus detracta aspiratione nominatur id, quod fuerit omnium primum; cui primo supplicabant velut parenti, et a quo rerum omnium factum putabant initium". [[Hesiod]] only reads (''[[Theogony|Theogonia]]'' 116): "Ή τοι μεν πρώτιστα Χάος γένετο..."; cfr. also Ovid ''Fasti'' I 103 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An association of the god to the Greek concept of Chaos is considered contrived by G. Capdeville, as the ''initial'' function of Janus would suffice to explain his place at the origin of time. See: G. Capdeville "Les épithètes cultuels de Janus" in ''[[Mélanges de l'École française de Rome]], (Antiquité)''  '''85''' 2 1973 p. 399-400; Capdeville mentions also Varro apud Augustine, ''De Civitate Dei'' VII 8, who uses the word ''hiatus'' to explain the assimilation of Janus to the world : "Duas eum facies ante et retro habere dicunt, quod hiatus noster, cum os aperimus, mundus similis videatur; unde et palatum Graeci ουρανόν appellant, et nonnulli, inquit, poetae Latini caelum vocaverunt ''palatum'', a quo hiatu oris et fores esse aditum ad dentes versus introrsus ad fauces". Ianus would be the gap (hiatus) through which the sky, represented as the dome of the palate, is manifest: the first meaning of ''palatum'' was sky. Capdeville finds a reminiscence of the same etymology also in [[Valerius Messala]] augur's definition, apud Macrobius  ''Saturnalia'' I 9, 14, that sounds as somehow related to Paulus's: "He who makes and rules everything, keeping together with the force of the allcovering heaven the heavy nature of earth and water collapsing into the deep with the light nature of fire and wind escaping into the boundless high."&lt;/ref&gt;

Another etymology proposed by [[Nigidius Figulus]] is related by [[Macrobius]]:&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius above I 9,8.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ianus'' would be [[Apollo]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] ''Iana'', by the addition of a ''D'' for the sake of euphony. This explanation has been accepted by A. B. Cook and J. G. Frazer. It supports all the assimilations of Janus to the bright sky, the sun and the moon. It supposes a former *Dianus, formed on *dia- &lt; *dy-eð&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; from the [[Indo-European Languages|Indo-European]] root *dey- shine represented in Latin by ''dies'' day, Diovis and Iuppiter.&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Cook ''Zeus. A Study in Ancient Religion'' Cambridge 1925 II p. 338-9 supposes two parallel series *Divianus, *Dianus, Ianus and Diviana (Varro ''Lingua Latina'' V 68), Diana, Iana (Varro ''De Re Rustica'' I 37, 3). This interpretation encounters the difficulty of the long ''i'' in Dīāna. G. Radke ''Die Götter Altitaliens'' Münster 1965 p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; However the form Dianus postulated by Nigidius is not attested.

A third etymology indicated by [[Cicero]], [[Ovid]] and [[Macrobius]], which explains the name as Latin, deriving it from the verb ''ire'' ("to go") is based on the interpretation of Janus as the god of beginnings and transitions.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' I 126-7; Macrobius, ''[[Saturnalia]]'', I, 9, 11: "Alii mundum, id est caelum, esse voluerunt: Ianumque ab eundo dictum, quod mundum semper eat, dum in orbem volvitur et ex se initium faciens in se refertur: unde et Cornificius Etymorum libro tertio: Cicero, inquit, non-Ianum sed Eanum nominat, ab eundo." It should be observed that Cornificius's quotation from Cicero contains a mistake, as Cicero did not name a ''Eanum''; Cicero ''De Natura Deorum'' II 67: "Cumque in omnibus rebus vim habent maxumam prima et extrema, principem in sacrificando Ianum esse voluerunt, quod ab eundo nomen est ductum, ex quo transitiones perviae iani foresque in liminibus profanarum aedium ianuae nominantur"." "As in everything the first and the last things have the greatest force, they wanted that Janus be the first in sacrificial actions, because his name is derived from going, from which fact previous passages are named ''iani'' and the hollows in the boundary of secular houses ''ianuae''."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theology and functions ==
[[File:Janus.xcf|thumb|upright=1.5|Different depictions of Janus from [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]'s ''L'antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures'']]

While the fundamental nature of Janus is debated, in most modern scholars' view the god's functions may be seen as being organized around a single principle: presiding over all beginnings and transitions, whether abstract or concrete, sacred or profane.&lt;ref&gt;Among these: C.

Grimal, "Le dieu Janus et les origines de Rome", ''Lettres d'humanité'' 4 (1945), pp. 15–121 esp. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all of these modern explanations were originally formulated by the ancients.&lt;ref&gt;R. Schilling above p. 102 cites Lydus ''De Mensibus'' IV 2 who states that according to Varro the Etruscans called him Heaven; Augustine ''De Civitate Dei'' VII 7 identifies him with the world; Longinus and Messala, cited by Lydus above IV 1, with time; Gavius Bassus with air and Hera (apud Lydus above IV 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

===God of beginnings and passages===
His function as god of beginnings has been clearly expressed in numerous ancient sources, among them most notably Cicero, Ovid, and Varro.&lt;ref&gt;Varro apud Augustine ''De Civitate Dei'' VII 9: "Penes Ianum sunt prima, penes Iovem summa... Janus rules over the first things, Jupiter over the highest ones. It is thence right that Jupiter be considered the king of everything, because accomplishment has the first place in order of importance (''dignitas'') even though it has the second in order of time".&lt;/ref&gt; As a god of motion, Janus looks after passages, causes actions to start and presides over all beginnings. Since movement and change are interconnected, he has a double nature, symbolised in his two headed image.&lt;ref&gt;M. Renard, "Aspects anciens de Janus et de Junon", ''Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire'' 31/1 (1953), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; He has under his tutelage the stepping in and out of the door of homes,&lt;ref&gt;C. Bailey above p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''ianua'', which took its name from him,&lt;ref&gt;F. Altheim ''History of Roman Religion'' London 1938 p. 194; V. Basanoff, ''Les dieux des Romains'' (Paris, 1942), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and not vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;M. Renard above p. 6 against C. Bailey above p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, his tutelage extends to the covered passages named ''iani'' and foremost to the gates of the city, including the cultic gate of the ''{{lang|la|Argiletum}}'', named ''{{lang|la|Ianus Geminus}}'' or ''{{lang|la|Porta Ianualis}}'' from which he protects Rome against the Sabines.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' I 257 ff.; on the location of the ''Porta Ianualis'' cf. P. Grimal, "{{lang|fr|Le dieu Janus et les origines de Rome}}", ''Lettres d' humanité''  4 (1945), p. 41; "Le ''Janus'' de l'Argilete", ''Mélanges d'archaeologie et d'histoire'' 64 (1952), pp. 39–58; G. Lugli ''Roma antica. Il centro monumentale'' (Rome, 1946), p. 82ff.; A. Boethius, "Il tempio di Giano in imo Argileto" in ''Symbolae Philologicae Gotoburgenses'' (Gotheborg, 1950) p.23ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also present at the [[Sororium Tigillum]], where he guards the terminus of the ways into Rome from Latium.&lt;ref&gt;It is possible that the Tigillum was on the boundary of the [[pomerium]], perhaps the eastern gate at the end of the ''decumanus'' of Rome, before the inclusion of the [[Septimontium]]: cf. the repetition of the formula ''vel intra pomerium vel extra pomerium'' in Livy's record concerning the expiation of the Horatius (I 26, 6 and 11): R. Schilling, "Janus. Le dieu introducteur. Le dieu des passages",  ''Mélanges d'archéologie et d'histoire'' 72 (1960), p. 110, citing A. Piganiol in ''MEFR'' (1908), pp. 233–82.&lt;/ref&gt; He has an altar, later a temple near the ''[[Porta Carmentalis]]'', where the road leading to [[Veii]] ended, as well as being present on the [[Janiculum]], a gateway from Rome out to Etruria.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus s.v. Ianiculum; L. Audin "Janus, le génie de l'Argilète", ''Lettres d' Humanité'' 10 (1951), pp. 54–5, 59, 71, 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection of the notions of beginning (''principium''), movement, transition (''eundo''), and thence time was clearly expressed by Cicero.&lt;ref&gt;C. Bailey, ''Phases in the Religion of Ancient Rome'' (Berkeley, 1932), p. 46; Cicero ''De Natura Deorum'' II 67.&lt;/ref&gt;
In general, Janus is at the origin of time as the guardian of the gates of Heaven: Jupiter himself can move forth and back because of Janus's working.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' I 125–126: "I preside over the gates of Heaven together with the mild Hours: Jupiter himself goes and comes back by my working".&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his temples, probably that of [[Forum Holitorium]], the hands of his statue were positioned to signify the number 355 (the number of days in a lunar year), later 365, symbolically expressing his mastership over time.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''Naturalis Historia'' XXXIV 7; Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 9 10; Lydus ''De Mensibus'' I 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He presides over the concrete and abstract beginnings of the world,&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], in the ''Carmen Saliare'' Janus is called "creator", as the initiator of the world itself. ''De Lingua Latina'', VII, 26–27; Ovid ''Fasti'' I 117-20 states he is the ruler and mover of the universe.&lt;/ref&gt; such as religion and the gods themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 9, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; he too holds the access to Heaven and to other gods: this is the reason why men must invoke him first, regardless of the god they want to pray to or placate.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' I 173-4.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the initiator of human life,&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius defines him ''Consivium'', i.e. propagator of the mankind. ''Saturnalia'', I, 9, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; of new historical ages, and financial enterprises: according to myth he was the first to mint coins and the [[As (coin)|as]], first coin of the liberal series, bears his effigy on one face.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Sat. '' I 7, 22: the ship on the other face remembers the arrival of Saturn; cf. Ovid ''Fasti'' I 230-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===God of change===
Janus frequently symbolized change and transitions such as the progress of past to future, from one condition to another, from one vision to another, and young people's growth to adulthood. He represented time because he could see into the past with one face and into the future with the other.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 7, 20 and I 9, 4: [[Antevorta]] and [[Postvorta]] or Porrima are his associates deities in this function.  Ovid ''Fasti'' I 133-40 states his double head means he as ''caelestis ianitor aulae'', gatekeeper of the heavenly mansion, can watch both the eastern and western gate of heaven.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Janus was worshipped at the beginnings of the harvest and planting times, as well as at marriages, deaths and other beginnings. He represented the middle ground between barbarism and civilization, rural and urban space, youth and adulthood. Having jurisdiction over beginnings Janus had an intrinsic association with omens and auspices.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' I 178-82:"Omens are in the beginnings, You turn your fearful ears to the first sound and the augur decides on the grounds of the first bird he has seen. The doors of the temples are open as well as the ears of the gods...and the words have weight".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Position in the pantheon===
[[Leonhard Schmitz]] suggests that he was likely the most important god in the Roman archaic ''pantheon''. He was often invoked together with ''Iuppiter'' (Jupiter).&lt;ref&gt;L. Schmitz s.v. Janus in W. Smith above p. 550-551.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Structural peculiarity theory====
{{main|Trifunctional hypothesis}}
In several of his works [[G. Dumézil]] proposed the existence of a structural difference in level between the [[Proto-Indo-European gods]] of beginning and ending, and the other gods whom Dumézil postulated fall into [[Trifunctional hypothesis|a tripartite structure]], reflecting the most ancient organization of society. So in [[Proto-Indo-European religion|IE religions]] there is an introducer god (such as [[Vedic]] [[Vâyu]] and Roman Janus) and a god of ending, and a nurturer goddess who is often also a fire spirit (such as Roman [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], Vedic [[Saraswati]] and [[Agni]], [[Avestic]] [[Armaiti]] and [[Anahita|Anâitâ]]) who show a sort of mutual solidarity.

The concept of 'god of ending' is defined in connection to the human point of reference, i.e. the current situation of man in the universe, and not to endings as transitions into new circumstances, which are under the jurisdiction of the gods of beginning, owing to the ambivalent nature of the concept. Thus the god of beginning is not structurally reducible to a sovereign god, nor the goddess of ending to any of the three categories on to which Dumézil distributed goddesses. There is though a greater degree of fuzziness concerning the function and role of goddesses, which may have formed a preexisting structure allowing the absorption of the local Mediterranean mother goddesses, nurturers, and protectresses .&lt;ref name=Dumézil-1946&gt;{{cite book |author=Dumézil, G. |author-link=Georges Dumézil |year=1946 |section=De Janus à Vesta |title=Tarpeia |place=Paris, FR |pages=33–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marconi, M. |title=Riflessi mediterranei nella piú antica religione laziale |place=Milan, IT |year=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, the position of the gods of beginning would not be the issue of a diachronic process of debasement undergone by a supreme sky god, but rather a structural feature inherent to the culture's theology. The descent of primordial sky gods into the condition of ''[[deus otiosus]]'' is a well-known phenomenon in many religions.
Dumézil himself observed and discussed in many of his works the phenomenon of the fall of archaic celestial deities in numerous societies of ethnologic interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Eliade, M. |author-link=Mircea Eliade |year=1949 |title=Traité d' histoire des religions |place=Paris, FR |page=53}}&lt;br/&gt; {{cite book |author=Eliade, M. |author-link=Mircea Eliade |year=1950 |title=Le chamanisme et les techniques archaiques de l'ecstase |place=Paris, FR |at=ch.&amp;nbsp;VI 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mircea Eliade]] evaluated Dumezil's views (1946)&lt;ref name=Dumézil-1946/&gt; positively, and recommended their use in comparative research on Indo-European religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eliade, M. |author-link=Mircea Eliade |year=1949 |title=Pour une histoire generale des religions Indo-europeennes |journal=Annales: Économie, Société, Civilisations |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=183–191, esp. pp. 189–190|doi=10.3406/ahess.1949.1718 |s2cid=161243722 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solar god theories====
According to [[Macrobius]] who cites [[Nigidius Figulus]] and [[Cicero]], ''Janus'' and ''Jana'' ([[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]) are a pair of divinities, worshipped as [[Apollo]] or the [[Sol (Roman mythology)|sun]] and [[Luna (mythology)|moon]], whence Janus received sacrifices before all the others, because through him is apparent the way of access to the desired deity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]] ''Saturnalia'' I 9, 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]] ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' ii. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar solar interpretation has been offered by A. Audin who interprets the god as the issue of a long process of development, starting with the [[Sumeric]] cultures, from the two solar pillars located on the eastern side of temples, each of them marking the direction of the rising sun at the dates of the two [[solstices]]: the southeastern corresponding to the Winter and the northeastern to the Summer solstice. These two pillars would be at the origin of the theology of the [[divine twins]], one of whom is mortal (related to the NE pillar, nearest the Northern region where the sun does not shine) and the other is immortal (related to the SE pillar and the Southern region where the sun always shines). Later these iconographic models evolved in the Middle East and Egypt into a single column representing two torsos and finally a single body with two heads looking at opposite directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Audin |year=1956 |title=Dianus bifrons ou les deux stations solaires, piliers jumeaux et portiques solsticiaux |journal=Revue de géographie de Lyon |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=191–198|doi=10.3406/geoca.1956.2090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Numa Pompilius|Numa]] in his regulation of the [[Roman calendar]] called the first month ''[[Ianuarius|Januarius]]'' after Janus, according to tradition considered the highest divinity at the time.{{clarify|reason=Conflicts with "January dedicated to Juno, not Janus" in introduction|date=April 2020}}

== Temples ==
[[File:Sesterce temple janus.JPG|thumb|The temple of Janus with closed doors, on a ''sestertius'' issued under [[Nero]] in 66 AD from the mint at [[Lugdunum]]]]
Numa built the ''[[Temple of Janus (Roman Forum)|Ianus geminus]]'' (also ''Janus Bifrons'', ''Janus Quirinus'' or ''Portae Belli''), a passage ritually opened at times of war, and shut again when Roman arms rested.&lt;ref&gt;Horat. Carm. iv. 15. 8; . Aen. vii. 607&lt;/ref&gt; It formed a walled enclosure with gates at each end, situated between the old [[Roman Forum]] and that of Julius Caesar, which had been consecrated by [[Numa Pompilius]] himself. About the exact location and aspect of the temple there has been much debate among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. V. Müller, "The Shrine of Janus Geminus in Rome", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 47 (1943), pp. 437–440; P. Grimal, "Le Janus de l' Argilète", ''Mélanges d'archéologie et d'histoire'' 64 (1952), pp. 39–58.&lt;/ref&gt; In wartime the gates of the Janus were opened, and in its interior sacrifices and ''vaticinia'' were held, to forecast the outcome of military deeds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''History of Rome'', I, 19, 2;&lt;/ref&gt; The doors were closed only during peacetime, an extremely rare event.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] wrote in his ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'' that the doors of the temple had only been closed twice since the reign of Numa: firstly in 235 BC after the [[first Punic war]] and secondly in after the [[battle of Actium]] in 31 BC. Cf. Ovid ''Fasti'' I 121–4; 277–83.&lt;/ref&gt; The function of the Ianus Geminus was supposed to be a sort of good omen: in time of peace it was said to close the wars within or to keep peace inside;{{Which|date=March 2012}} in times of war it was said to be open to allow the return of the people on duty.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid above I 279–280; Virgil above.&lt;/ref&gt;

A temple of Janus is said to have been consecrated by the consul [[Gaius Duilius]] in 260 BC after the [[battle of Milazzo (260 BC)|Battle of Mylae]] in the [[Forum Holitorium]]. It contained a statue of the god with the right hand showing the number 300 and the left the number 65—i.e., the length in days of the solar year, and twelve altars, one for each month.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''Naturalis Historia'' XXXIV 33; Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 9 10; Varro apud Macrobius above I 9 16. R. Schilling above p. 115 remarks such a feature could have been added only after the Julian reform of the calendar.&lt;/ref&gt;

The four-sided structure known as the [[Arch of Janus]] in the [[Forum of Nerva|Forum Transitorium]] dates from the 1st century of the Christian era: according to common opinion it was built by the Emperor [[Domitian]]. However American scholars L. Ross Taylor and L. Adams Holland on the grounds of a passage of [[Statius]]&lt;ref&gt;''Silvae'' IV 3, 9–10: "... qui limina bellicosa Iani/ iustis legibus et foro coronat", "... who crowns the warlike boundaries of Janus with just laws and the Forum".&lt;/ref&gt; maintain that it was an earlier structure (tradition has it the ''Ianus Quadrifrons'' was brought to Rome from [[Falerii]]&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius I 9, 13; Servius ''Aen.'' VI 607; Lydus ''De Menisibus'' IV 1.&lt;/ref&gt;) and that Domitian only surrounded it with his new forum.&lt;ref&gt;L. Adams Holland, "Janus and the Fasti", ''Classical Philology'' (1952), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the building of the Forum Transitorium was completed and inaugurated by [[Nerva]] in AD 96.

== Cult epithets ==
Another way of investigating the complex nature of Janus is by systematically analysing his cultic epithets: religious documents may preserve a notion of a deity's theology more accurately than other literary sources.

The main sources of Janus's cult epithets are the fragments of the [[Carmen Saliare]] preserved by Varro in his work [[De Lingua Latina]], a list preserved in a passage of [[Macrobius]]'s [[Saturnalia]] (I 9, 15–16), another in a passage of [[Johannes Lydus]]'s [[De Mensibus]] (IV 1), a list in [[Cedrenus]]'s  ''Historiarum Compendium'' (I p.&amp;nbsp;295 7 Bonn), partly dependent on Lydus's, and one in [[Servius Honoratus]]'s commentary to the ''Aeneis'' (VII 610).&lt;ref&gt;G Capdeville above p. 404-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Literary works also preserve some of Janus's cult epithets, such as [[Ovid]]'s long passage of the ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' devoted to Janus at the beginning of Book I (89–293), [[Tertullian]], [[Augustine]] and [[Arnobius]].

=== Carmen Saliare ===
As may be expected the opening verses of the Carmen,&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''Lingua Latina'' VII 26 and 27.&lt;/ref&gt; are devoted to honouring Janus, thence were named ''{{lang|la|versus ianuli}}''.&lt;ref&gt;This does not mean that there was any particular link between the [[Salii]] and Janus, contrary to what Lydus states in ''{{lang|la|De Mensibus}}'' IV 2, i. e. that the Salii were consecrated to the cult of Janus. R. G. Kent in the Loeb edition of Varro's ''{{lang|la|De Lingua Latina}}'' 1938 p. 293 n. e states these verses were addressed to Mars.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul the Deacon&lt;ref&gt;Paulus Festi epitome s.v. ''{{lang|la|axamenta}}''  p.&amp;nbsp;3 L.&lt;/ref&gt; mentions the ''{{lang|la|versus ianuli, iovii, iunonii, minervii}}''. Only part of the ''{{lang|la|versus ianuli}}'' and two of the ''{{lang|la|iovii}}'' are preserved.

The manuscript has:

:(paragraph 26): "''{{lang|la|cozeulodorieso. omia ũo adpatula coemisse./ ian cusianes duonus ceruses. dun; ianusue uet põmelios eum recum}}''";

:(paragraph 27): "''{{lang|la|diuum êpta cante diuum deo supplicante}}.''" "''{{lang|la|ianitos}}''".

Many reconstructions have been proposed:&lt;ref&gt;References in A.B. Cook above II p.&amp;nbsp;329–331; a later attempt by J. F. K. Dirichs ''Die urlateinischen Reklamestrophe auf dem sogenannten Dresselschen Drillingsgefäss des sabinischen Töpfers Dufnos'' Heidelberg 1934 p.&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/ref&gt;
they vary widely in dubious points and are all tentative, nonetheless one can identify with certainty some epithets:

* ''Cozeiuod''&lt;ref&gt;Restoring ''i'' for ''l'': this reading is accepted by both Havet and Dirichs above.&lt;/ref&gt; ''orieso.''&lt;ref&gt;The interpretation "Cozeiuod orieso"&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;"Conseuiod orieso" is Dirich's. Havet reads: "{{lang|la|Cozeui adoriose}}"&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;"{{lang|la|Conseui gloriose}}" on the grounds of Paulus's glossa s.v. ''adoria'': "praise, glory deriving from the abundance of spelt (far)" p.&amp;nbsp;3, 22 L.&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{lang|la|Omnia vortitod}}''&lt;ref&gt;Capdeville follows L. Havet reading a future imperative of ''vorto''; cf. Ovid ''Fasti''&amp;nbsp;I pp.&amp;nbsp;119–120: "{{lang|la|Me penes est unum vasti custodia mundi,/ et ius vertendi cardinis omne meum est}}", "It is only my own power the tutelage of the vast universe,/ and the right of turning its hinge is all mine".&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{lang|la|Patulti; oenus es}}''
* ''{{lang|la|iancus}}'' (or ''{{lang|la|ianeus}}''), ''Iane, es, duonus Cerus es, duonus Ianus.''
* ''{{lang|la|Veniet potissimum melios eum recum}}.''
* ''{{lang|la|Diuum eum patrem}}'' (or ''{{lang|la|partem}}'') ''{{lang|la|cante, diuum deo supplicate}}.''
* ''{{lang|la|ianitos}}.''&lt;ref&gt;G Capdeville above p.&amp;nbsp;405–406, following in part L. Havet "{{lang|la|De Saturnio Latinorum versu}}" in ''BEPHE'' '''43''' Paris 1880 p.&amp;nbsp;243–251. "Let it begin from/with the Sower. Make everything turn, Patultius, Thou are the one/ Gatekeeper, Janus, are Thou, good creator are Thou, good Janus./ Let Him come, the most powerful of all kings./ Sing Him the father (or part) of the gods, beseech the god of the gods./ Gatekeeper.&lt;/ref&gt;

The epithets that can be identified are:
; ''Cozeuios'': i.e. ''{{lang|la|Conseuius}}'' the Sower, which opens the carmen and is attested as an old form of ''Consivius'' in [[Tertullian]];&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Nationes''&amp;nbsp;II 11, 3.  Cozeuiod, ablative case of Cozeuios, would be an archaic spelling of {{lang|la|Consēuius}}: -ns&gt; -nts&gt;  -ts&gt;  -z. Cf.&amp;nbsp;[[Velius Longus]] ''Orthographia''&amp;nbsp;8 p.&amp;nbsp;50, 9 and 51, 5th&amp;nbsp;ed. Keil on the use of letter  ''z'' in the carmen Saliare.&lt;/ref&gt;
; ''{{lang|la|Patultius}}'': the Opener;
; ''{{lang|la|Iancus}}'' or ''{{lang|la|Ianeus}}'': the Gatekeeper;
; ''{{lang|la|Duonus Cerus}}'': the Good Creator;
; ''rex'': king ({{lang|la|potissimum melios eum recum}} – the most powerful and best of kings);
; ''{{lang|la|diuum patrem (partem) }}'':&lt;ref&gt;Festus s.v. ''pa'' p.&amp;nbsp;222L: "{{lang|la|pa pro parte, po pro potissimum in Saliari carmine positum est}}": the correction ''{{lang|la|patre}}'' for ''{{lang|la|parte}}'' is allowed by Müller, by not by Lindsay.&lt;/ref&gt; father of the gods (or part of the gods);
; ''{{lang|la|diuum deus}}'': god of the gods;
; ''{{lang|la|ianitos}}'': keeping track of time, Gatekeeper.

=== Other sources ===
The above-mentioned sources give: ''Ianus Geminus, I. Pater, I. Iunonius, I. Consivius, I. Quirinus, I. Patulcius and Clusivius'' (Macrobius above I 9, 15): Ι. Κονσίβιον, Ι. Κήνουλον, Ι. Κιβουλλιον, I. Πατρίκιον, I. Κλουσίβιον, I.  Ιουνώνιον, I. Κυρινον, I. Πατούλκιον, I. Κλούσιον, I. Κουριάτιον (Lydus above IV 1); I. Κιβούλλιον, I. Κυρινον, I. Κονσαιον, I. Πατρίκιον (Cedrenus ''Historiarum Compendium'' I p.&amp;nbsp;295 7 Bonn); ''I.  Clusiuius, I. Patulcius, I. Iunonius, I. Quirinus'' (Servius ''Aen.'' VII 610).

Even though the lists overlap to a certain extent (five epithets are common to Macrobius's and Lydus's list), the explanations of the epithets differ remarkably. Macrobius's list and explanation are probably based directly on [[Cornelius Labeo]]'s work, as he cites this author often in his ''Saturnalia'', as when he gives a list of [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]]'s cult epithets&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius above I 12, 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; and mentions one of his works, ''Fasti''.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius above I 16, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In relating Janus' epithets Macrobius states: "We invoke in the sacred rites". Labeo himself, as it is stated in the passage on Maia, read them in the lists of [[indigitamenta]] of the [[libri pontificum]]. On the other hand, Lydus's authority cannot have consulted these documents precisely because he offers different (and sometimes bizarre) explanations for the common epithets: it seems likely he received a list with no interpretations appended and his interpretations are only his own.&lt;ref&gt;Capdeville above p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pater====
''Pater'' is perhaps the most frequent epithet of Janus, found also in the composition ''Ianuspater''. While numerous gods share this cultic epithet it seems the Romans felt it was typically pertinent to Janus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Atheneus]] ''Deipnosophistes'' 15, 692d: Masurius says: "The god Janus is considered among ourselves also as our father."&lt;/ref&gt; When invoked along with other gods, usually only he is called pater.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil ''Aen.'' VIII 357: "Hanc Ianus Pater , hanc Saturnus condidit arcem"; Horace ''Epistulae'' I 16, 59: " "Iane pater" clare, clare cum dixit "Apollo" "; Seneca ''Apolocyntosis''IX 2: "primus interrogatur sententiam Ianus pater"; Arnobius ''Ad Nationes'' III 29: "Incipiamus ...sollemniter ab Iano et nos patre".&lt;/ref&gt; For Janus the title is not just a term of respect; principally it marks his primordial role. He is the first of the gods and thus their father: the formula ''quasi deorum deum'' corresponds to ''diuum deus'' of the carmen Saliare.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius above I 9, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the expression ''duonus Cerus'', Cerus means creator and is considered a masculine form related to [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]].&lt;ref&gt;Paulus p. 109L; Probus ''In Vergilii Gergicae'' I 7; Servius ibidem.&lt;/ref&gt;
Lydus gives Πατρίκιος (Patricius) and explains it as ''autóchthon'': since he does not give another epithet corresponding to Pater it may be inferred that Lydus understands Patricius as a synonym of Pater.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Lydus ''Mag.'' I 16 p. 20, 24 W on Romulus and the patres called patricii, considered equivalent to ευπατρίδας ; similar confusion in other Greek authors as Plutarch ''Romulus'' XIII 2 and 3; Zonaras ''Histor.'' VII 3.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence connecting Janus to gentilician{{clarify|date=September 2014}} cults or identifying him as a national god particularly venerated by the oldest patrician families.&lt;ref&gt;This hypothesis is advanced by L. Preller- H. Jordan ''Römische Mythologie'' Berlin 1881 2nd p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geminus====
''Geminus'' is the first epithet in Macrobius's list. Although the etymology of the word is unclear,&lt;ref&gt;A. Ernout- A. Meillet ''Dict. Etym. de la langue latine'' 4th ed. s.v. p. 268–9.&lt;/ref&gt; it is certainly related to his most typical character, that of having two faces or heads. The proof are the numerous equivalent expressions.&lt;ref&gt;''bifrons'' (Vergil ''Aeneis'' VII 180; XII 198; Servius ''Aen.'' VII 607; Ausonius ''Eclogae'' X 2; ''Dom''. VI 5; Prudentius ''Sym.'' I 233; Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 9, 4 and 13; Augustine ''De Civ. Dei'' VII 7,8 Isidorus ''Origines'' V 33, 3); ''biceps'' (Ovid ''Fasti'' I 65; ''Pontica'' IV 4, 23); ''anceps'' (Ovid ''Metamorphoses'' XIV 334; ''Fasti'' I 95); ''biformis'' (Ovid ''Fasti'' I 89; V 424).&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this epithet might be either concrete, referring directly to the image of the god reproduced on coins&lt;ref&gt;Pliny above XXXIV 45; Plutarch ''Quaestiones Romanae'' 41, 274 e; Atheneus XV 692 e. For Italian coins cf.  E. A. Sydenham ''The coinage of the Roman Republic'' London 1952 no. 8 p. 2 and plate 4 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and supposed to have been introduced by king [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]] in the sanctuary at the lowest point of the Argiletum,&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 19, 2; Pliny ''Naturalis Historia'' XXXIV 33; Servius ''Ad Aen.'' VII 607.&lt;/ref&gt; or to a feature of the Ianus of the ''Porta Belli'', the double gate ritually opened at the beginning of wars,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Vergil ''Aen.'' VII 607 on the analogous monument in the town of [[Latinus]].&lt;/ref&gt; or abstract, deriving metaphorically from the liminal, intermediary functions of the god themselves: both in time and space passages connected two different spheres, realms or worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' I 73–4; Macrobius above I 9, 9; Servius ''Ad Aen.'' VII 610; Lydus above IV 2 p. 65, 7 Wünsch.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Janus quadrifrons'' or ''quadriformis'', brought according to tradition from Falerii in 241 BC&lt;ref&gt;Servius ''Ad Aen.'' VII 607; Macrobius ''Sat.'' I 9, 13; Augustin ''Civ. Dei'' VII 4, 8; Isidorus ''Origines'' VIII 11, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and installed by Domitian in the [[Forum of Nerva|Forum Transitorium]],&lt;ref&gt;Lydus above IV 1 p. 64, 4 W.&lt;/ref&gt; although having a different meaning, seems to be connected to the same theological complex, as its image purports an ability to rule over every direction, element and time of the year. It did not give rise to a new epithet though.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius above; Lydus above; Augustine above VII 8; VII 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Pettazzoni above p. 89: "A naïve iconographic expression of watching into the two opposite directions and thence, ideally, into every direction".&lt;/ref&gt;

====Patulcius and Clusivius the 1st====
''Patulcius'' and ''Clusivius'' or ''Clusius'' are epithets related to an inherent quality and function of doors, that of standing open or shut. Janus as the Gatekeeper has jurisdiction over every kind of door and passage and the power of opening or closing them.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid above I 117-8: "Quidquid ubique vides, caelum, mare, nubila, terras,/ omnia sunt nostra clausa patentque manu".&lt;/ref&gt; Servius interprets Patulcius in the same way. Lydus gives an incorrect translation, "αντί του οδαιον" which however reflects one of the attributes of the god, that of being the protector of roads.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius above I 9, 7 considers this to be an attribute of Janus as gatekeeper: "...cum clavi et virga figuratus , quasi omnium portarum custos et rector viarum".&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere Lydus cites the epithet θυρέος to justify the key held by Janus.&lt;ref&gt;Lydus above p. 64, 2 W.&lt;/ref&gt; The antithetical quality of the two epithets is meant to refer to the alterning opposite conditions&lt;ref&gt;Ovid above I 131-2: "...nomina diversas significare vices".&lt;/ref&gt; and is commonly found in the ''indigitamenta'': in relation to Janus, Macrobius cites instances of [[Antevorta]] and [[Postvorta]],&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius above I 7, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; the personifications of two indigitations of [[Carmentis]].&lt;ref&gt;Varro apud Gellius ''Noctes Atticae'' XVI 16, 4 in the form [[Antevorta|Porrima]]; L. L. Tels De Jong ''Sur quelques divinités romaines de la naissance et de la prophétie'' Leyden Delft 1959 p. 41-60. Another instance of opposite epithets in the indigitamenta is that of [[Empanda|Panda]] and Cela, referring to [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]]. Cf. J. Bayet " "Feriae Sementiuae" et les Indigitations dans le culte de Ceres et de Tellus" in ''Revue de l'histoiire des religions'' '''137''' 1950 p. 172-206 part. p.195-197.&lt;/ref&gt;
These epithets are associated with the ritual function of Janus in the opening of the ''{{lang|la|Porta Ianualis}}'' or ''Porta Belli''.&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''Lingua Latina'' V 165: Livy I 19, 2; Pliny ''Naturalis Historia'' XXXIV 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The rite might go back to times pre-dating the founding of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Vergil ''Aeneis'' VII 601–615.&lt;/ref&gt; Poets tried to explain this rite by imagining that the gate closed either war or peace inside the ''ianus'', but in its religious significance it might have been meant to propitiate the return home of the victorious soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid above I 279-80; Servius ''Aen.'' I 291; Lydus IV 2 p. 65,17 W.; G. Capdeville above p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quirinus====
''Quirinus'' is a debated epithet. According to some scholars, mostly Francophone, it looks to be strictly related to the ideas of the passage of the Roman people from war back to peace, from the condition of ''miles'', soldier, to that of ''quiris'', citizen occupied in peaceful business, as the rites of the ''Porta Belli'' imply. This is in fact the usual sense of the word ''quirites'' in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;G . Dumézil ''La religion romaine archaïque '' Paris 1966 above p. 246-271; R. Schilling "Janus. Le dieu introducteur. Le dieu des passages" in ''Melanges d'archeologie et d'histoire'' '''72''' 1960 p.119-120 citing G. Wissowa ''Religion und Kultus der Römer'' Munich 1912 p. 109; Paulus p. 43 L: "Romani a Quirino Quirites dicuntur"; Festus p. 304L: "... Quirites dicti, post foedus a Romulo et Tatio percussum, communionem et societatem populi factam indicant"." ... are named Quirites after the community and society created because of the treaty made by Tatius and Romulus".&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, mainly Germanophone, think it is related on the contrary to the martial character of the god Quirinus, an interpretation supported by numerous ancient sources: Lydus,&lt;ref&gt;Lydus above: "πρόμαχος".&lt;/ref&gt; Cedrenus,&lt;ref&gt;Cedrenus, above.&lt;/ref&gt; Macrobius,&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius above I 9, 16: "Quirinus quasi bellorum potentem, ab hasta quam Sabini ''curin'' vocant".&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid,&lt;ref&gt;Ovid above II 475–478.&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''Romulus'' XXIX 1; ''Quaestiones Romanae'' XXVII 285 cd.&lt;/ref&gt; and Paul the Daecon.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus 43, 1 L.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Deubner ''Mitteilungen des deutschen archaeologisches Institut'' Berlin '''36–37''' 1921–1922 p. 14 ff.; W. F. Otto ''Pauly Real Enzyklopaedie der Altertumswissenschaften'' Supplem. III col. 1182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schilling and Capdeville counter that it is his function of presiding over the return to peace that gave Janus this epithet, as confirmed by his association on 30 March with [[Pax (mythology)|Pax]], [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]] and [[Salus]],&lt;ref&gt;Ovid above III 881–882; J.- C. Richard "Pax, Concordia et la religion officielle de Janus à la fin de la République romaine'' in ''MEFR'' '''75''' 1963 p. 303-386.&lt;/ref&gt; even though it is true that Janus as god of all beginnings presides also over that of war and is thus often called ''belliger'', bringer of war&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucan]] ''Pharsalia'' I 61-2; [[Statius]] ''Silvae'' II 3, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''pacificus''. This use is also discussed by Dumézil in various works concerning the armed nature of the ''Mars qui praeest paci'', the armed quality of the gods of the third function and the arms of the third function.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil "Remarques sur les armes des dieux de la troisième fonction chez divers peuples indo-européens" in ''Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni''  '''28''' 1957 p. 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Koch on the other hand sees the epithet Janus Quirinus as a reflection of the god's patronage over the two months beginning and ending the year, after their addition by king Numa in his reform of the calendar. This interpretation too would befit the liminal nature of Janus.&lt;ref&gt;C. Koch "Bemerkungen zum römischen Quirinuskult" in ''Zeitschrift für Religions and Geistesgeschichte'' 1953 p.1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
The compound term ''Ianus Quirinus'' was particularly in vogue at the time of Augustus, its peaceful interpretation complying particularly well with the Augustan ideology of the ''Pax Romana''.&lt;ref&gt;Res Gestae Divi Augusti XIII; [[Suetonius]] ''Augustus'' XXII 5; [[Horace|Horatius]] ''Odes'' IV 15, 4–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The compound ''Ianus Quirinus'' is to be found also in the rite of the [[spolia opima]], a ''lex regia'' ascribed to Numa, which prescribed that the third rank spoils of a king or chief killed in battle, those conquered by a common soldier, be consecrated to ''Ianus Quirinus''.&lt;ref&gt;Only Festus s. v. p. 204, 13 L, among the three sources relating this rite has the expression ''Ianui Quirino''; Plutarch ''Marcellus'' VIII 9 and Servius (and Virgil himself) ''Aeneis'' VI 859 have only Quirinus. This has led to disputes among scholars on the value of the expression and its antiquity as [[Verrius Flaccus]] may have forged it.&lt;/ref&gt; Schilling believes the reference of this rite to Ianus Quirinus to embody the original prophetic interpretation, which ascribes to this deity the last and conclusive spoils of Roman history.&lt;ref&gt;R. Schilling above p.128, citing Festus s. v. spolia opima p. 204 L.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ποπάνων (Popanon, Libo?)====
The epithet ''Ποπάνων (Popanōn)'' is attested only by Lydus,&lt;ref&gt;Lydus above IV 2 p. 64, 18 W.&lt;/ref&gt; who cites Varro as stating that on the day of the [[kalendae]] he was offered a cake which earned him this title. There is no surviving evidence of this name in Latin, although the rite is attested by Ovid for the kalendae of January&lt;ref&gt;Ovid above I 128: "libum farraque mixta sale".&lt;/ref&gt; and by Paul.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus s.v. Ianual p. 93, 4 L.&lt;/ref&gt; This cake was named ''{{lang|la|ianual}}'' but the related epithet of Janus could not plausibly have been Ianualis: it has been suggested ''Libo''&lt;ref&gt;J. Speÿer above p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; which remains purely hypothetical. The context could allow an Etruscan etymology.

====Iunonius====
Janus owes the epithet ''Iunonius'' to his function as patron of all kalends, which are also associated with Juno. In Macrobius's explanation: "''Iunonium, as it were, not only does he hold the entry to January, but to all the months: indeed all the kalends are under the jurisdiction of Juno''". At the time when the rising of the new moon was observed by the [[pontifex]] minor the [[rex sacrorum]] assisted by him offered a sacrifice to Janus in the ''[[Curia Calabra]]'' while the [[regina sacrorum]] sacrificed to Juno in the [[regia]].&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius I 15, 9–10 and 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have maintained that Juno was the primitive paredra of the god. This point bears on the nature of Janus and Juno and is at the core of an important dispute: was Janus a debased ancient uranic supreme god, or were Janus and Jupiter co-existent, their distinct identities structurally inherent to their original theology?

Among Francophone scholars Grimal and (implicitly and partially) Renard and Basanoff have supported the view of a uranic supreme god against Dumézil and Schilling. Among Anglophone scholars Frazer and Cook have suggested an interpretation of Janus as uranic supreme god.

Whatever the case, it is certain that Janus and Juno show a peculiar reciprocal affinity: while Janus is ''Iunonius'', Juno is ''Ianualis'', as she presides over childbirth and the menstrual cycle, and opens doors.&lt;ref&gt;Servius ''Aeneis'' VII 620–622; Ovid ''Fasti'' I ; Isidore ''Origines'' VIII 11, 69: "Iunonem dicunt quasi Ianonem, id est ianuam, pro purgationibus feminarum, eo quod quasi portas matrum natis pandat, et nubentum maritis".&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, besides the kalends Janus and Juno are also associated at the rite of the Tigillum Sororium of 1 October, in which they bear the epithets ''Ianus Curiatius'' and ''Iuno Sororia''. These epithets, which swap the functional qualities of the gods, are the most remarkable apparent proof of their proximity.&lt;ref&gt;M.Renard above p. 14-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The rite is discussed in detail in the section below.

====Consivius====
''Consivius'', sower, is an epithet that reflects the tutelary function of the god at the first instant of human life and of life in general, conception. This function is a particular case of his function of patron of beginnings. As far as man is concerned it is obviously of the greatest importance, even though both Augustine and some modern scholars see it as minor.&lt;ref&gt;G. Capdeville above p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine shows astonishment at the fact that some of the [[Di selecti|dii selecti]] may be engaged in such tasks: "''In fact Janus himself first, when pregnancy is conceived, ... opens the way to receiving the semen''".&lt;ref&gt;Augustine above VII 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Varro on the other hand had clear the relevance of the function of starting a new life by opening the way to the semen and therefore started his enumeration of the gods with Janus, following the pattern of the Carmen Saliare.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine above VI 9: "Thus the same Varro starts mentioning and listing the gods from the conception of man, who have been given life from Janus"; VII 3: "... it is answered that Janus has in his power every start and therefore not without cause is he ascribed that of the opening to conception".&lt;/ref&gt; Macrobius gives the same interpretation of the epithet in his list: "''Consivius from sowing (conserendo), i. e. from the propagation of the human genre, that is disseminated by the working of Janus''."&lt;ref&gt;The etymology from ''sero'', albeit clear, presents a problem with the long first ''ī'' of Consīvius: this difficulty can be overcome if one considers {{lang|la|Consēuius}}, attested by [[Tertullian]] ''Ad Nationes'' II 11, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; as the most ancient form. He though does not consider ''{{lang|la|Conseuius}}'' to be an epithet of Janus but a theonym in its own right.

Lydus understands {{lang|la|Consivius}} as βουλαιον ({{lang|la|consiliarius}}) owing to a conflation with [[Consus]] through [[Ops]] Consiva or Consivia. The interpretation of Consus as god of advice is already present in Latin authors&lt;ref&gt;Paulus p. 36, 19 L; Tertullian ''De Spectaculis'' V 5; Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 23; Ausonius ''Eclogae''  XXIV 20; Servius ''Aeneis'' VIII 636; Augustine above IV 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and is due to a folk etymology supported by the story of the abduction of the Sabine women, (which happened on the day of the [[Consualia]] aestiva), said to have been advised by Consus. However no Latin source cites relationships of any kind between Consus and Janus Consivius. Moreover, both the passages that this etymology requires present difficulties, particularly as it seems Consus cannot be etymologically related to adjective ''{{lang|la|consivius}}'' or ''{{lang|la|conseuius}}'', found in Ops Consivia and thence the implied notion of sowing.&lt;ref&gt;G. Capdeville above p. 434. Consus is a ''u'' theme word and the only adjective it formed is Consualia.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Κήνουλος (Coenulus)====
''Κήνουλος ({{lang|grc-Latn|Coenulus}}) ''and ''Κιβουλλιος ({{lang|grc-Latn|Cibullius}})'' are not attested by Latin sources. The second epithet is not to be found in Lydus's manuscripts and is present in Cedrenus along with its explanation concerning food and nurture. The editor of Lydus R. Wünsch has added Cedrenus's passage after Lydus's own explanation of Coenulus as ευωχιαστικός, good host at a banquet. Capdeville considers Cedrenus' text to be due to a paleographic error: only ''Coenulus'' is indubitably an epithet of Janus and the adjective used to explain it, meaning to present and to treat well at dinner, was used in a ritual invocation before meals, wishing the diners to make good flesh.&lt;ref&gt;G. Capdeville above p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the features of Janus as shown by the myth that associates him with Carna, [[Cardea]], Crane.&lt;ref&gt;See below section on myths.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Curiatius====
The epithet ''Curiatius'' is found in association with ''Iuno Sororia'' as designating the deity to which one of the two altars behind the Tigillum Sororium was dedicated. [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] and other ancient authors&lt;ref&gt;W. Otto ''Real Encyclopaedie'' Suppl. III column 1178-9; Festus s.v. Sororium tigillum p. 380, 5 L.; Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Antiquitates Romanae'' III 22, 7–9; Scholiasta Bobiensis in Ciceronem ''Milo'' 7.&lt;/ref&gt; explain Curiatius by the aetiological legend of the Tigillum: the expiation undergone by P. Horatius after his victory over the Alban [[Curiatii]] for the murder of his own sister, by walking under a beam with his head veiled.&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 26, 13; Paulus ex Festus p.399, 2 L ; Pseudo Aurelius Victor ''Vir.'' 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Capdeville sees this epithet as related exclusively to the characters of the legend and the rite itself: He cites the analysis by Dumézil as his authority.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''Les Horaces et les Curiaces'' Paris 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schilling supposes it was probably a ''{{lang|la|sacrum}}'' originally entrusted to the ''{{lang|la|gens Horatia}}'' that allowed the desacralisation of the ''{{lang|la|iuvenes}}'' at the end of the military season, later transferred to the state.&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 26, 12: ''... pecunia publica'' ''at public expenses''.&lt;/ref&gt; Janus's patronage of a rite of passage would be natural. The presence of Juno would be related to the date (Kalends), her protection of the ''{{lang|la|iuvenes}}'', soldiers, or the legend itself.
Schilling's opinion is that it is related to ''[[curia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;R. Schilling "Janus, dieu introducteur, dieu des passages" in ''Melanges d' archeologie et d'histoire'' '''72''' 1960 p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; as the Tigillum was located not far from the ''{{lang|la|curiae veteres}}''.

Renard considered Schilling's interpretation unacceptable, even though supported by an inscription (''{{lang|la|lictor curiatius}}'')&lt;ref&gt;R. Schilling above citing ''Real Encyclopaedie'' s.v. calata comitia column 1330. Aulus Gellius ''Noctes Atticae'' XV 27, 2 has ''lictor curiatus''.&lt;/ref&gt; because of the different quantity of the ''u'', short in ''{{lang|la|curiatius}}'', ''{{lang|la|curis}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Curitis}}'' and long in ''{{lang|la|curia}}''. Moreover, it is part of the different interpretation of the meaning of the ritual of the Tigillum Sororium proposed by Herbert Jennings Rose, Kurt Latte, and Robert Schilling himself.
Renard connects the epithet's meaning to the ''{{lang|la|curis}}'' or ''{{lang|la|cuiris}}'', the spear of Juno Curitis as here she is given the epithet of ''Sororia'', corresponding to the usual epithet ''Geminus'' of Janus and to the twin or feminine nature of the passage between two coupled posts.&lt;ref&gt;M. Renard above p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the etymology of ''Curiatius'' remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;For a thorough listing of the hypotheses advanced cf. A. Walde – J. B. Hoffmann ''Lateinische etymologisches Wörterbuch'' 1938 3rd p. 319 s.v.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the role of Janus in the rite of the Tigillum Sororium see also the section that follows.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rites ==
The rites concerning Janus were numerous. Owing to the versatile and far reaching character of his basic function marking all beginnings and transitions, his presence was ubiquitous and fragmented. Apart from the rites solemnizing the beginning of the new year and of every month, there were the special times of the year which marked the beginning and closing of the military season, in March and October respectively. These included the rite of the ''arma movēre'' on 1 March and that of the ''arma condĕre'' at the end of the month performed by the [[Salii]], and the ''Tigillum Sororium'' on 1 October. Janus Quirinus was closely associated with the anniversaries of the dedications of the temples of Mars on 1 June (a date that corresponded with the festival of [[Cardea|Carna]], a deity associated with Janus: see below) and of that of Quirinus on 29 June (which was the last day of the month in the pre-Julian calendar). These important rites are discussed in detail below.

Any rite or religious act whatever required the invocation of Janus first, with a corresponding invocation to [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] at the end (''Janus primus'' and ''Vesta extrema''). Instances are to be found in the ''Carmen Saliare'', the formula of the [[devotio]],&lt;ref&gt;Livy VIII 9, 6&lt;/ref&gt; the lustration of the fields and the sacrifice of the ''porca praecidanea'',&lt;ref&gt;Cato ''De Agri Cultura'' 141 and 143.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Acta'' of the [[Arval Brethren]].&lt;ref&gt;''Acta Fratrum Arvalium'' ed. Henze p. CCXIV and 144 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Janus had no [[flamen]], he was closely associated with the [[rex sacrorum]] who performed his sacrifices and took part in most of his rites: the ''rex'' held the first place in the [[ordo sacerdotum]], hierarchy of priests.&lt;ref&gt;Some scholars opine that the rex was Janus's priest, e.g. M. Renard "Aspects anciens de Jaanus et de Junon" in ''Revue belge de philologie et d' histoire'' '''31''' 1. 1953 p. 8. G. Dumézil disagrees as he considers the rex also and even more directly associated with Jupiter.&lt;/ref&gt; The flamen of [[Portunus (mythology)|Portunus]] performed the ritual greasing of the spear of the god Quirinus on 17 August, day of the [[Portunalia]], on the same date that the temple of Janus in the [[Forum Holitorium]] had been consecrated by consul [[Gaius Duilius]] in 260 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Portunus seems to be a god closely related to Janus, if with a specifically restricted area of competence, in that he presides over doorways and harbours and shares with Janus his two symbols, the key and the stick: Scholiasta Veronensis ''Aen.'' V 241: "god of harbours and patron of doors". See also section below.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beginning of the year ===
The winter solstice was thought to occur on 25 December. On 1 January was [[New Year's Day]]: the day was consecrated to Janus since it was the first of the new year and of the month (kalends) of Janus: the ''feria'' had an augural character as Romans believed the beginning of anything was an [[omen]] for the whole. Thus on that day it was customary to exchange cheerful words of good wishes.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' I 178–182.&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason everybody devoted a short time to his usual business,&lt;ref&gt;Ovid above 166–170.&lt;/ref&gt; exchanged dates, figs and honey as a token of well wishing and made gifts of coins called ''strenae''.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid above 187–190; Pliny ''Naturalis Historia'' XXIII 3, 13; Martial VIII 33; XIII 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Cakes made of spelt (''far'') and salt were offered to the god and burnt on the altar.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' I 127-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Schmitz in W. Smith ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' s.v. Ianus II p. 550-552 London 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid states that in most ancient times there were no animal sacrifices and gods were propitiated with offerings of spelt and pure salt.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' I 337-8.&lt;/ref&gt; This ''{{lang|la|libum}}'' was named ''{{lang|la|ianual}}'' and it was probably correspondent to the ''summanal'' offered the day before the Summer solstice to god [[Summanus]], which however was sweet being made with flour, honey and milk.
[[File:Ianus ianuarius.jpg|thumb|The month of January is named after Janus]] 
Shortly afterwards, on 9 January, on the ''{{lang|la|feria}}'' of the [[Agonium]] of January the [[rex sacrorum]] offered the sacrifice of a ram to Janus.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid above 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beginning of the month ===
At the kalends of each month the {{lang|la|rex sacrorum}} and the pontifex minor offered a sacrifice to Janus in the curia Calabra, while the regina offered a sow or a she lamb to Juno.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 15, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beginning of the day ===
Morning belonged to Janus: men started their daily activities and business. Horace calls him ''Matutine Pater'', morning father.&lt;ref&gt;Horace ''Sermones'' II 6, 20–23:"Morning Father or if you prefer being called in this (other) way, Janus, Thou with whom men start business and works, do open my poem".&lt;/ref&gt; G. Dumézil believes this custom is at the origin of the learned interpretations of Janus as a solar deity.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil, ''La religion romaine archaïque'' (Paris, 1974), part II chapt. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Space ===
Janus was also involved in spatial transitions, presiding over home doors, city gates and boundaries. Numerous toponyms of places located at the boundary between the territory of two communities, especially Etrurians and Latins or Umbrians, are named after the god.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giano dell'Umbria]], [[Torgiano]] near Perugia, [[Iano]] near Volterra.&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable instance is the [[Ianiculum]] which marked the access to [[Etruria]] from Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus ex Festus s.v. P. L.&lt;/ref&gt; Since borders often coincided with rivers and the border of Rome (and other Italics) with Etruria was the [[Tiber]], it has been argued that its crossing had a religious connotation; it would have involved a set of rigorous apotropaic practices and a devotional attitude. Janus would have originally regulated particularly the crossing of this sacred river through the [[pons sublicius]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Adams Holland above.&lt;/ref&gt;
The name of the Iāniculum is not derived by that of the god, but from the abstract noun ''iānus, -us''.&lt;ref&gt;P. Grimal above p. 40-43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulus s. v. above : "Ianiculum dictum, quod per eum Romanus populus primitus transierit in agrum Etruscum". "It is named Janiculum because originally the Romans passed on to the Etruscan territory (ager) through it".&lt;/ref&gt; Adams Holland opines it would have been originally the name of a small bridge connecting the [[Tiber Island]] (on which she supposes the first shrine of Janus stood) with the right bank of the river.&lt;ref&gt;L. Adams Holland above p. 231-3.&lt;/ref&gt;
However Janus was the protector of doors, gates and roadways in general, as is shown by his two symbols, the key and the staff.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 9 7: "But among us the name of Janus shows that he was the patron of all doorways, which is similar to Θυραίω. Indeed he is represented also with a key and a stick, as if he were the protector of all doorways and the ruler of all roadways"; Ovid ''Fasti'' I 254-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The key too was a sign that the traveller had come to a harbour or ford in peace to exchange his goods.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gagé, "Sur les origines du culte de Janus", ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' 195/1 (1979), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rite of the bride's oiling the posts of the door of her new home with wolf fat at her arrival, though not mentioning Janus explicitly, is a rite of passage related to the ''ianua''.

=== Rites of the Salii ===
The rites of the Salii marked the springtime beginning of the war season in March and its closing in October. The structure of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] [[Sodales|sodalitas]], made up by the two groups of the Salii Palatini, who were consecrated to Mars and whose institution was traditionally ascribed to Numa (with headquarter on the Palatine), and the Salii Collini or Agonales, consecrated to Quirinus and whose foundation was ascribed to Tullus Hostilius, (with headquarter on the Quirinal) reflects in its division the dialectic symbolic role they played in the rites of the opening and closing of the military season.&lt;ref&gt;The two groups were of twelve people each. They stood under the patronage of the gods of the archaic triad: cf. Servius ''Aen.'' VIII 663 "… the Salii who are under the tutelage of Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus".&lt;/ref&gt; So does the legend of their foundation itself: the peace-loving king Numa instituted the Salii of [[Mars Gradivus]], foreseeing the future wars of the Romans&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 20, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; while the warmonger king Tullus, in a battle during a longstanding war with the Sabines, swore to found a second group of Salii should he obtain victory.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius Halicarnasseus III 32, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The paradox of the pacifist king serving Mars and passage to war and of the warmonger king serving Quirinus to achieve peace under the expected conditions highlights the dialectic nature of the cooperation between the two gods, inherent to their own function.&lt;ref&gt;Tullus's vow included beside the institution of the Salii also that of the [[Saturnalia]] (perhaps along with the [[Consualia]]) and of the [[Opalia]] after the storing of the harvest: all festivals related to peace, fertility and plenty.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the working of the talismans of the sovereign god they guaranteed alternatively force and victory, fecundity and plenty. It is noteworthy that the two groups of Salii did not split their competences so that one group only opened the way to war and the other to peace: they worked together both at the opening and the conclusion of the military season, marking the passage of power from one god to the other. Thus the Salii enacted the dialectic nature present in the warring and peaceful aspect of the Roman people, particularly the ''iuvenes''.&lt;ref&gt;A passage of Statius ''Silvae'' V 2, 128, to be found in a poem in honour of his friend Crispinus, a Salius Collinus, suggests clearly the difference between the functions of the arms of Quirinus and those of Mars (and Minerva): "Mars and the virgin Actea shew the points ... the arms of Quirinus ... shields born from the clouds and arms untouched by slaughter": the arms of Quirinus were peaceful.&lt;/ref&gt;

This dialectic was reflected materially by the location of the temple of Mars outside the [[pomerium]] and of the temple of Quirinus inside it.&lt;ref&gt;Servius ''Aen.'' I 292 "Thence in the City there two temples of his, of Quirinus within the Urbs, as if protector but peaceful, another on the ''Via Appia'' outside the ''Urbs'' near the gate, as if warrior, or ''gradivus'' ": the gate is the ''Porta Capena''; VI 860: "Quirinus is the Mars that presides over peace and is worshipped inside the city: in fact the Mars of war has his temple outside it". Regardless of the actual date of their foundation their location is archaic: for Quirinus cf. Paulus p. 303 L and for Mars Festus p. 204 L.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual dialectic rhythm of the rites of the Salii of March and October was also further reflected within the rites of each month and spatially by their repeated crossing of the pomerial line. The rites of March started on the first with the ceremony of the ''ancilia movere'', developed through the month on the 14th with [[Equirria]] in the [[Campus Martius]] (and the [[Mamuralia|rite of Mamurius Veturius]] marking the expulsion of the old year), the 17th with the [[Agonium Martiale]], the 19th with the [[Quinquatrus]] in the [[Comitium]] (which correspond symmetrically with the [[Armilustrium]] of 19 October), on the 23rd with the [[Tubilustrium]] and they terminated at the end of the month with the rite of the ''ancilia condere''. Only after this month-long set of rites was accomplished was it [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#fas|fas]] to undertake military campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius ''Othon'' VIII 5: "He started the expedition before it was ritually correct, without any care for religious praescriptions, but with ''ancilia''  ''moved'' and not yet ''stored'' "; Ovid ''Fasti'' III 395f.: "The arms move the fight: the fight is alien to the grooms, when they have been stored the omen shall be more propitious".&lt;/ref&gt;

While Janus sometimes is named  ''belliger''&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucan]] ''Pharsalia'' I 61–62: "Pax missa per orbem/ ferrea belligeri compescat limina Iani". Statius ''Silvae'' II 3,12: "belligerum Iani nemus".&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes ''pacificus''&lt;ref&gt;Martial VIII 66, 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; in accord with his general function of beginner, he is mentioned as ''Janus Quirinus'' in relation to the closing of the rites of March at the end of the month together with [[Pax (mythology)|Pax]], [[Salus]] and [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]]:&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' III 879–882: "... Janus is to be worshipped together with mild Concord and Safety of the Roman people and the altar of Peace".&lt;/ref&gt; This feature is a reflection of the aspect of Janus Quirinus which stresses the ''quirinal '' function of bringing peace back and the hope of soldiers for a victorious return.&lt;ref&gt;Servius ''Aen.'' I 291: "It is a better reason that those who go to war desire the come back."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ancients give an armed and even military definition of Quirinus: Macrobius I 9 16; Ovid II 475-8; Plutarch ''Romulus '' 29, 1; ''Quaestiones Romanae'' 27; Paulus 43, 1 L. But while his armed character of is not in contradiction with the nature of Quirinus as well as of the gods of the third function, a definitely and exclusively martial character is unacceptable and looks to be a later development, due to the assimilation of Romulus with Quirinus. The legend of Romulus' later life had strong military connotations, which changed the original character of Quirinus. According to Dumezil the interpretation Quirnus-Romulus came about via a different route, i. e. the [[divine twins]] myth, of which [[Romulus and Remus]] are an instance. Their myth is representative and belongs to the category of the gods of the third function, as e.g. the [[Dioskuri]], the [[Ashvins]]. Whatever the original nature of the Sabine Quirinus, in Rome this god did not originally have a military function.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the rites of the Salii mimic the passage from peace to war and back to peace by moving between the two poles of Mars and Quirinus in the monthly cycle of March, so they do in the ceremonies of October, the ''Equus October'' ("[[October Horse]]") taking place on the Campus Martius&lt;ref&gt;Festus p. 190 L.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Armilustrium'', purification of the arms, on the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]],&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''Lingua Latina'' VI 22; V 153; Plutarch ''Quaestiones Romanae'' 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Tubilustrium]] on the 23rd. Other correspondences may be found in the dates of the founding of the temples of Mars on 1 June and of that of Quirinus on 29 June, in the pre-Julian calendar the last day of the month, implying that the opening of the month belonged to Mars and the closing to Quirinus.

The reciprocity of the two gods' situations is subsumed under the role of opener and closer played by Janus as Ovid states: "''Why are you hidden in peace, and open when the arms have been moved?''"&lt;ref&gt;''Fasti'' I 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Another analogous correspondence may be found in the festival of the [[Quirinalia]] of February, last month of the ancient calendar of Numa.&lt;ref&gt;C. Koch above; R. Schilling above p. 124 n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The rite of the opening and closure of the Janus Quirinus would thus reflect the idea of the reintegration of the ''miles'' into civil society, i.e. the community of the ''quirites'', by playing a lustral role similar to the ''Tigillum Sororium'' and the ''{{lang|la|porta triumphalis}}'' located at the south of the Campus Martius. In Augustan ideology this symbolic meaning was strongly emphasised.&lt;ref&gt;Thus Ovid may conclude his passage devoted to Janus with the words "Janus, do make peace and those who administer it (Augustus and Germanicus) eternal." in ''Fasti'' I 287. Horace too mentions that Augustus closed the ''Ianum Quirini'' in ''Carmina'' IV 15, 9 and calls "Janus ... protector of the peace" in ''Epistulae'' II 1, 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tigillum Sororium ===
{{Main|Tigillum Sororium}}
This rite was supposed to commemorate the expiation of the murder of his own sister by Marcus Horatius.&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 26. Dionysius of Halicarnassus III 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The young hero with his head veiled had to pass under a beam spanning an alley. The rite was repeated every year on 1 October.&lt;ref&gt;CIL I 2nd p. 214: "Fasti Aru. ad Kal. Oct. : Tigillo Soror(io) ad compitum Acili"&lt;/ref&gt; The ''tigillum'' consisted of a beam on two posts.&lt;ref&gt;Festus s. v. Sororium tigillum p. 380 L.: "Horatius duo tigilla tertio superiecto ... subit".&lt;/ref&gt; It was kept in good condition at public expenses to the time of Livy. Behind the ''tigillum'', on opposite sides of the alley, stood the two altars of Janus Curiatius and Juno Sororia. Its location was on the vicus leading to the [[Carinae]], perhaps at the point of the crossing of the [[pomerium]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 26, 6 and 11 repeats twice the formula ''{{lang|la|vel intra pomerium vel extra pomerium}}''.&lt;/ref&gt; The rite and myth have been interpreted by Dumezil as a purification and desacralization of the soldiers from the religious pollution contracted in war, and a freeing of the warrior from ''furor'', wrath, as dangerous in the city as it is necessary on campaign.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil, ''Myths romains I. Les Horaces et les Curiaces'' (Paris, 1942), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rite took place on the kalends of October, the month marking the end of the yearly military activity in ancient Rome. Scholars have offered different interpretations of the meaning of Janus Curiatius and Juno Sororia. The association of the two gods with this rite is not immediately clear. It is however apparent that they exchanged their epithets, as Curiatius is connected to (Juno) Curitis and Sororia to (Janus) Geminus.&lt;ref&gt;M. Renard "Aspects anciens de Janus et de Junon" above p. 9 and ff. citing E. L. Shields, ''Juno'' (Northampton, Mass., 1926), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Renard thinks that while Janus is the god of motion and transitions he is not concerned directly with purification, while the arch is more associated with Juno. This fact would be testified by the epithet Sororium, shared by the ''tigillum'' and the goddess. Juno Curitis is also the protectress of the ''iuvenes'', the young soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Martianus Capella ''De Nuptiis'' II 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul the Deacon states that the ''sororium tigillum'' was a ''sacer'' (sacred) place in honour of Juno.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus s.v. Sororium tigillum p. 399 L.&lt;/ref&gt; Another element linking Juno with Janus is her identification with Carna, suggested by the festival of this deity on the kalends (day of Juno) of June, the month of Juno.

Carna was a nymph of the sacred ''lucus'' of Helernus, made goddess of hinges by Janus with the name of [[Cardea]], and had the power of protecting and purifying thresholds and the doorposts.&lt;ref&gt;A. Grenier, ''Les religions étrusque et romaine'' (Paris, 1948), pp. 115 and 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Pettazzoni, "Carna", ''Studi Etruschi'' 14 (1940), p. 163ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' VI 155&lt;/ref&gt; This would be a further element in explaining the role of Juno in the ''Tigillum''. It was also customary for new brides to oil the posts of the door of their new homes with wolf fat. In the myth of Janus and Carna (see section below) Carna had the habit when pursued by a young man of asking him out of shyness for a hidden recess and thereupon fleeing: but two headed Janus saw her hiding in a crag under some rocks. Thence the analogy with the rite of the Tigillum Sororium would be apparent: both in the myth and in the rite Janus, the god of motion, goes through a low passage to attain Carna as Horatius passes under the ''tigillum'' to obtain his purification and the restitution to the condition of citizen eligible for civil activities, including family life. The purification is then the prerequisite for fertility. The custom of attaining lustration and fertility by passing under a gap in rocks, a hole in the soil or a hollow in a tree is widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Roscher, ''Lexicon'', s.v. Ianus col. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The veiled head of Horatius could also be explained as an apotropaic device if one considers the ''{{lang|la|tigillum}}'' the ''{{lang|la|iugum}}'' of Juno, the feminine principle of fecundity. Renard concludes that the rite is under the tutelage of both Janus and Juno, being a rite of transition under the patronage of Janus and of desacralisation and fertility under that of Juno: through it the ''{{lang|la|iuvenes}}'' coming back from campaign were restituted to their fertile condition of husbands and peasants. Janus is often associated with fecundity in myths, representing the masculine principle of motion, while Juno represents the complementary feminine principle of fertility: the action of the first would allow the manifestation of the other.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Augustin ''De Civitate Dei'' VII 2 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Myths ==
In discussing myths about Janus, one should be careful in distinguishing those which are ancient and originally Latin and those others which were later attributed to him by Greek mythographers.&lt;ref&gt;R. Schilling above p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Fasti'' Ovid relates only the myths that associate Janus with [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], whom he welcomed as a guest and with whom he eventually shared his kingdom in reward for teaching the art of agriculture, and to the nymph Crane, Grane, or Carna, whom Janus raped and made the goddess of hinges as [[Cardea]],&lt;ref name="Ovid Fasti VI 101-130"&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' VI 101–130.&lt;/ref&gt; while in the ''Metamorphoses'' he records his fathering with [[Venilia]] the nymph [[Canens (mythology)|Canens]], loved by [[Picus]], first legendary king of the [[Aborigines (mythology)|Aborigines]].&lt;ref&gt;Ovid XIV 333 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth of Crane has been studied by M. Renard&lt;ref&gt;M. Renard "Aspect anciens de Janus et de Junon" above pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; and G. Dumezil.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''Fêtes romaines d'été et d'automn. Suivi par dix questions romaines'' "Question X. Theologica minora" Paris 1975 p. 223ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The first scholar sees in it a sort of parallel with the theology underlying the rite of the Tigillum Sororium. Crane is a nymph of the sacred wood of [[Helernus]], located at the issue of the Tiber, whose festival of 1 February corresponded with that of Juno Sospita:&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' II 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Crane might be seen as a minor ''imago'' of the goddess. Her habit of deceiving her male pursuers by hiding in crags in the soil reveals her association not only with vegetation but also with rocks, caverns, and underpassages.&lt;ref&gt;In Greece Crane, Cranea is an epithet of Athens, meaning the rocky city; the Cranai are nymphs of rocks, or Naiads of springs. L. Rocci ''Dizionario Greco -Italiano'' Roma 1972 s. v.&lt;/ref&gt; Her nature looks to be also associated with vegetation and nurture: G. Dumezil has proved that Helernus was a god of vegetation, vegetative lushness and orchards, particularly associated with vetch. As Ovid writes in his ''Fasti'',&lt;ref name="Ovid Fasti VI 101-130"/&gt; 1 June was the festival day of Carna, besides being the calendary festival of the month of Juno and the festival of Juno Moneta. Ovid seems to purposefully conflate and identify Carna with Cardea in the aetiologic myth related above. Consequently, the association of both Janus and the god Helernus with Carna-Crane is highlighted in this myth: it was customary on that day to eat ivetch (mashed beans) and lard, which were supposed to strengthen the body. Cardea had also magic powers for protecting doorways (by touching thresholds and posts with wet hawthorn twigs) and newborn children by the aggression of the [[striges]] (in the myth the young Proca).&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' VI 131–183.&lt;/ref&gt; M. Renard sees the association of Janus with Crane as reminiscent of widespread rites of lustration and fertility performed through ritual walking under low crags or holes in the soil or natural hollows in trees, which in turn are reflected in the lustrative rite of the Tigillum Sororium.

Macrobius&lt;ref&gt;''Saturnalia'' I 7, 19ff.&lt;/ref&gt; relates that Janus was supposed to have shared a kingdom with [[Camese]] in [[Latium]], in a place then named Camesene. He states that [[Hyginus]] recorded the tale on the authority of a Protarchus of [[Tralles]]. In Macrobius Camese is a male: after Camese's death Janus reigned alone. However Greek authors make of Camese Janus's sister and spouse: [[Atheneus]]&lt;ref&gt;Atheneus ''Deipnosophistes'' XV 46=692.&lt;/ref&gt; citing a certain Drakon of [[Corcyra]] writes that Janus fathered with his sister Camese a son named Aithex and a daughter named Olistene.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman in R.E. Pauly-Wissowa V column 1663 no. 16 writes Drakon might have lived at the time of Augustus, R. Schilling thinks he lived only after Pliny the Elder. Cf. Plutarch ''Quaestiones Romanae'' 22 on Camise.&lt;/ref&gt; Servius Danielis&lt;ref&gt;''Aen''. VIII 330.&lt;/ref&gt; states [[Tiber]] (i.e., [[Tiberinus (god)|Tiberinus]]) was their son.

[[Arnobius]] writes that [[Fontus]] was the son of Janus and [[Juturna]].&lt;ref&gt;''Adversus Nationes'' III 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The name itself proves that this is a secondary form of Fons modelled on Janus,&lt;ref&gt;Walde-Hoffmann LEW s. v. Fons.&lt;/ref&gt; denouncing the late character of this myth: it was probably conceived because of the proximity of the festivals of Juturna (11 January) and the Agonium of Janus (9 January) as well as for the presence of an altar of Fons near the Janiculum&lt;ref&gt;G. Wissowa ''Religion und Kultus der Römer'' Munich 1912 p. 221. Cf. Cicero ''De Legibus'' II 56.&lt;/ref&gt; and the closeness of the notions of spring and of beginning.

Plutarch&lt;ref&gt;''Quaestiones Romanae'' 22.&lt;/ref&gt; writes that according to some Janus was a Greek from [[Perrhebia]].&lt;ref&gt;Comparing this tradition with [[Strabon]]'s passage in ''Geographia'' X 2, 12 (who cites [[Odyssea]] X 190–192) on the Ionians, French scholar J. Gagé has seen a Hyperborean origin of Janus, derived from the Protohellenes of Thessaly and the Pelasgians. Cf. J. Gagé, "Sur les origines du culte de Janus", ''Revue de l' histoire des religions'' 195/1 (1979), pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Romulus]] and his men [[The Rape of the Sabine Women|kidnapped the Sabine women]], and Rome was attacked by the Sabines under king [[Titus Tatius|Tatius]], Janus caused a volcanic hot spring to erupt, resulting in the would-be attackers being buried alive in the deathly hot, brutal water and ash mixture of the rushing hot volcanic springs that killed, burned, or disfigured many of Tatius's men. This spring is called Lautolae by Varro.&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''Lingua Latina'' V 156; Paulus ex Festus p. 105, 11 L.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, however, the Sabines and Romans agreed on creating a new community together. In honor of this, the doors of a walled roofless structure called 'The Janus' (not a temple) were kept open during war after a symbolic contingent of soldiers had marched through it. The doors were closed in ceremony when peace was concluded.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 9, 17–18; Ovid ''Metamorphoses'' XIV 781–799; ''Fasti'' I 259–276; Servius ''Ad Aen.'' I 291; VIII 361; Mythographus Vaticanus III 4, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin, legends, and history ==
[[File:Canusium as 79000809.jpg|thumb|300px|A bronze ''[[As (Roman coin)|as]]'' from [[Canusium]] depicting a laureate Janus with the prow of a ship on the reverse]]
In accord with his fundamental character of being the Beginner, Janus was considered by Romans the first king of Latium, sometimes along with Camese.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 7, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He would have received hospitably the god [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], who, expelled from Heaven by Jupiter, arrived on a ship to the Janiculum. Janus would have also effected the miracle of turning the waters of the spring at the foot of the [[Viminal]] from cold to scorching hot to fend off the assault of the Sabines of king [[Titus Tatius]], come to avenge the kidnapping of their daughters by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' I 265–276: ''Metamorphoses'' XIV 775–800.&lt;/ref&gt;

His temple named Janus Geminus had to stand open in times of war. It was said to have been built by king [[Numa Pompilius]], who kept it always shut during his reign as there were no wars. After him it was closed very few times, one after the end of the first Punic War, three times under [[Augustus]] and once by [[Nero]]. It is recorded that emperor [[Gordianus III]] opened the Janus Geminus.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Capitolinus ''Gordianus'' XXVI 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a noteworthy curiosity that the opening of the Janus was perhaps the last act connected to the ancient religion in Rome: [[Procopius]] writes&lt;ref&gt;Procopius ''De Bello Gothico'' I 25.&lt;/ref&gt; that in 536, during the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]], while general [[Belisarius]] was under siege in Rome, at night somebody opened the Janus Geminus stealthily, which had stayed closed since the 390 edict of [[Theodosius I]] that banned the ancient cults. Janus was faithful to his liminal role also in the marking of this last act.&lt;ref&gt;R. Schilling above p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distant origin hypothesis===
The uniqueness of Janus in Latium has suggested to L. Adams Holland and J. Gagé the hypothesis of a cult brought from far away by sailors and strictly linked to the amphibious life of the primitive communities living on the banks of the Tiber. In the myth of Janus, the ship of Saturn, as well as the myth of [[Carmenta]] and [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]] are reminiscent of an ancient pre-Roman sailing life. The elements that seem to connect Janus to sailing are presented in two articles by J. Gagé summarised here below.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gagé, "Sur les origines du culte de Janus", ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' 195/1 and 2, pp. 3–33 and 129–151. [https://www.persee.fr/doc/rhr_0035-1423_1979_num_195_1_6814]&lt;/ref&gt;

====1. The boat of Janus and the beliefs of the primitive sailing techniques====

;(a) The proximity of Janus and Portunus and the functions of the ''flamen Portunalis'': The temple of Janus was dedicated by [[Gaius Duilius]] on 17 August, day of the [[Portunalia]]. The key was the symbol of both gods and was also meant to signify that the boarding boat was a peaceful merchant boat.

:The ''flamen Portunalis'' oiled the arms of [[Quirinus]] with an ointment kept in a peculiar container named ''persillum'', term perhaps derived from Etruscan ''persie''.&lt;ref&gt;E. Peruzzi, "Un etruschismo del latino religioso", ''Rivista di Filologia Italiana e Classica'' (1976), pp. 144–148.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar object seems to be represented in a fresco picture of the Calendar of Ostia on which young boys prepare to apply a resin contained in a basin to a boat on a cart, i.e. yet to be launched.

;(b) The ''Tigillum Sororium'': The ''Tigillum Sororium'' would be related to a gentilician cult of wood of the [[Horatii]], as surmised by the episodes of the ''pons sublicius'' defended by [[Horatius Cocles]], and of the posts of the main entrance of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus on which [[Marcus Horatius Pulvillus]] lay his hand during the dedication rite. Gagé thinks the magic power of the ''Tigillum Sororium'' should be ascribed to the lively and burgeoning nature of wood.

====2. Religious quality of trees====
Trees as the wild olive, and the Greek or Italic lotus (''[[Celtis australis]]''), have analogous religious qualities to those of corniolum and wild fig for sailing communities: its wood does not rot in sea water, thence it was used in shipbuilding and in the making of rolls for hauling of ships overland.

====3. The depiction of Janus and Boreas as bifrons====
The depiction of both Janus and [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] as bifrons, and seasonal elements.

;(a) The calendar of Numa and the role of Janus: Contradictions of the ancient Roman calendar on the beginning of the new year: originally March was the first month and February the last one. January, the month of Janus, became the first after several changes in the calendar. The liminal character of Janus is still present in the association to the [[Saturnalia]] of December, reflecting the strict relationship between the two gods Janus and Saturn and the rather blurred distinction of their stories and symbols.

:The initial role of Janus in the political-religious operations of January: the ''nuncupatio votorum'' spanning the year, the imperial symbol of the boat in the opening rite of the sailing season, the ''vota felicia'': Janus and his myths allow for an ancient interpretation of the ''vota felicia'', different from the Isiadic one.

;(b) The idea of the Seasons in the ancient traditions of the [[Ionian Islands]]: The crossing of the [[Hyperborean]] myths. [[Cephalonia]] as a place at the cross of famous winds. Application of the theory of winds for the navigation in the Ionian Sea. The type ''Boreas Bifrons'' as probable model of the Roman Janus.

:This observation was made first by the ''Roscher Lexicon'': "Ianus is he too, doubtlessly, a god of wind"&lt;ref&gt;repeated in the ''RE Pauly-Wissowa'' s.v. Boreas by Rapp, P.&lt;/ref&gt; Grimal has taken up this interpretation connecting it to a vase with red figures representing [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] pursuing the nymph [[Oreithyia]]: Boreas is depicted as a two headed winged demon, the two faces with beards, one black and the other fair, perhaps symbolising the double movement of the winds Boreas and Antiboreas. This proves that the Greeks of the 5th century BC knew the image of Janus. Gagé feels compelled to mention here another parallel with Janus to be found in the figure of [[Argus Panoptes|Argos]] with one hundred eyes and in his association with his murderer [[Hermes]].

;(c) Solar, solsticial and cosmological elements: While there is no direct proof of an original solar meaning of Janus, this being the issue of learned speculations of the Roman erudits initiated into the mysteries and of emperors as [[Domitian]], the derivation from a Syrian cosmogonic deity proposed by P. Grimal looks more acceptable. Gagé though sees an ancient, preclassical Greek mythic substratum to which belong [[Deucalion]] and [[Pyrrha]], and the [[Hyperborean]] origins of the Delphic cult of [[Apollo]], as well as the [[Argonauts]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Delcourt ''Pyrrhus et Pyrrha'' Liège 1965; G. Colli ''La sapienza greca'' I. Milano 1977 p. 27; 45–47; 431–434.&lt;/ref&gt; The beliefs in the magic power of trees is reflected in the use of the olive wood, as for the rolls of the ship Argos: the myth of the Argonauts has links with [[Corcyra]], remembered by [[Lucius Ampelius]].&lt;ref&gt;''Liber memorialis'' VIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

====4. The sites of the cults of Janus at Rome====
The sites of the cults of Janus at Rome and his associations in ancient Latium.

;(a) ''Argiletum'': Varro gives either the myth of the killing of Argos as an etymology of the word Argi-letum (death of Argos), which looks to be purely fantastic, or that of place located upon a soil of clay, ''argilla'' in Latin. The place so named stood at the foot of the [[Viminal]], the hill of the reeds. It could also be referred to the white willow tree, used to make objects of trelliswork.

;(b) The [[Janiculum]]: The [[Janiculum]] may have been inhabited by people who were not Latin but had close alliances with Rome.&lt;ref&gt;L. Adams Holland above p. 224ff.: conquests of Ancus Marcius; J. Gagé ''La chute des Tarquins et les debuts de la Republique romaine'' Paris 1976 p. 197 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The right bank of the Tiber would constitute a typical, convenient, commodious landing place for boats and the cult of Janus would have been double insofar as amphibious.

;(c) Janus in Latium: Janus's cultic alliances and relations in Latium show a pre-Latin character. Janus has no association in cult (calendar or prayer ''formulae'') with any other entity. Even though he bears the epithet of ''Pater'' he is not head of a divine family; however some testimonies lend him a companion, sometimes female, and a son and / or a daughter. They belong to the family of the nymphs or genies of springs. Janus intervenes in the miracle of the hot spring during the battle between Romulus and Tatius: [[Juturna]] and the nymphs of the springs are clearly related to Janus as well as [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], that in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' cooperates in the miracle and may have been confused with [[Venilia]], or perhaps the two might have been originally one.

:Janus has a direct link only to Venilia, with whom he fathered [[Canens (mythology)|Canens]].&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Metamorphoses'' XIV 334.&lt;/ref&gt; The magic role of the wild olive tree (''oleaster'') is prominent in the description of the duel between [[Aeneas]] and [[Turnus]]&lt;ref&gt;Vergil ''Aeneis'' XII 766 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting its religious significance and powers: it was sacred to sailors, also those who had shipwrecked as a protecting guide to the shore. It was probably venerated by a Prelatin culture in association with [[Faunus]].

:In the story of [[Venulus]] coming back from [[Apulia]] too one may see the religious connotation of the wild olive: the king discovers one into which a local shepherd had been turned for failing to respect the nymphs he had come across in a nearby cavern, apparently Venilia, who was the deity associated with the magic virtues of such tree.

:Gagé finds it remarkable that the characters related to Janus are in the ''Aeneis'' on the side of the [[Rutuli]]. In the poem Janus would be represented by [[Tiberinus (god)|Tiberinus]]. Olistene, the daughter of Janus with Camese, may reflect in her name that of the olive or ''oleaster'', or of Oreithyia.&lt;ref&gt;G. Radke ''Die Götter Altitaliens'' Münster 1965 s.v. Olistene, or Olistine: the name might also be related to adjective ''olitana'' meaning ''vetusta'' extremely old: cf. ''Corpus Glossariorum Latinorum'' IV 264.&lt;/ref&gt; Camese may be reflected in [[Carmenta]]: Evander's mother is from [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]], comes to Latium as an exile migrant and has her two festivals in January: Camese's name at any rate does not look Latin.

====5. Sociological remarks====

;(a) The vagueness of Janus's association with the cults of primitive Latium: The vagueness of Janus's association with the cults of primitive Latium and his indifference towards the social composition of the Roman State suggest that he was a god of an earlier amphibious merchant society in which the role of the guardian god was indispensable.

;(b) Janus bifrons and the [[Penates]]: Even though the cult of Janus cannot be confused with that of the Penates, related with Dardanian migrants from Troy, the binary nature of the Penates and of Janus postulates a correspondent ethnic or social organisation. Here the model is thought to be provided by the cult of the ''Magni Dei'' or [[Cabeiri]] preserved at [[Samothrace]] and worshipped particularly among sailing merchants.

:The aetiological myth is noteworthy too: at the beginning one finds [[Dardanus (son of Zeus)|Dardanos]] and his brother [[Iasion|Iasios]]&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus I 61: Iasos would have unduely aspired to the union with Demeter; Diodorus Siculus V 49: Iasion is on the contrary asked for the union by Demeter and from it Plutos is born.&lt;/ref&gt; appearing as auxiliary figures in a [[Phrygia]]n cult to a [[Cybele|Great Mother]].

:In Italy there is a trace of a conflict between worshippers of the Argive [[Hera]] ([[Diomedes]] and the Diomedians of the south) and of the Penates. The cult of Janus looks to be related to social groups remained at the fringe of the Phrygian ones. They might or might not have been related to the cult of the [[Dioscuri]].&lt;ref&gt;Objections by D. Briquel in ''MEFRA'' '''88''' 1976 p. 44 against St. Weinstock in ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 1960 p. 112 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with other gods ==

=== Janus and Juno ===
The relationship between Janus and Juno is defined by the closeness of the notions of beginning and transition and the functions of conception and delivery. The reader is referred to the above sections ''Cult epithets'' and ''Tigillum Sororium'' of this article and the corresponding section of article [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]].

=== Janus and Quirinus ===
[[Quirinus]] is a god that incarnates the ''quirites'', i.e. the Romans in their civil capacity of producers and fathers. He is surnamed  ''Mars tranquillus'' (peaceful Mars), ''Mars qui praeest paci'' (Mars who presides on peace). His function of ''custos'' guardian is highlighted by the location of his temple inside the [[pomerium]] but not far from the gate of Porta Collina or Quirinalis, near the shrines of [[Sancus]] and [[Salus]].

As a protector of peace he is nevertheless armed, in the same way as the ''quirites'' are, as they are potentially ''milites'' soldiers: his statue represents him is holding a spear. For this reason Janus, god of gates, is concerned with his function of protector of the civil community. For the same reason the flamen Portunalis oiled the arms of Quirinus, implying that they were to be kept in good order and ready even though they were not to be used immediately.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil above p. 236-238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumézil and Schilling remark that as a god of the [[third function]] Quirinus is peaceful and represents the ideal of the ''pax romana'' i. e. a peace resting on victory.&lt;ref&gt;On the arms of the gods of the third function cf. G. Dumézil, "Remarques sur les armes des dieux de troisième fonction chez divers peuples indo-européens", ''Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni'' 28 (1957), pp. 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Janus and Portunus ===
[[Portunes|Portunus]] may be defined as a sort of duplication inside the scope of the powers and attributes of Janus.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wissowa ''Religion und Kultus der Römer'' (Munich, 1912), 2nd p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; His original definition shows he was the god of gates and doors and of harbours. In fact it is debated whether his original function was only that of god of gates and the function of god of harbours was a later addition: Paul the Deacon writes:
: "... he is depicted holding a key in his hand and was thought to be the god of gates".

Varro would have stated that he was the god of harbours and patron of gates.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Scholia]] Veronensia ad Aeneidem'' V 241.&lt;/ref&gt; His festival day named [[Portunalia]] fell on 17 August, and he was venerated on that day in a temple ''ad pontem Aemilium'' and ''ad pontem Sublicium'' that had been dedicated on that date.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wissowa above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Portunus, unlike Janus, had his own [[flamen]], named ''Portunalis''. It is noteworthy that the temple of Janus in the [[Forum Holitorium]] had been consecrated on the day of the Portunalia, and that the flamen Portunalis was in charge of oiling the arms of the statue of [[Quirinus]].&lt;ref&gt;Festus s. v. persillum p. 238 L. The ''persillum'' was a ''rediculum'', small container in which the ointment was kept.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Schilling above p. 99 and n. 4, p. 120; G. Dumézil above part I chapt. 5 It. tr. p.237-238.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Janus and Vesta ===
The relationship between Janus and [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] touches on the question of the nature and function of the gods of beginning and ending in [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European religion]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil, "De Janus à Vesta" in ''Tarpeia'' (Paris, 1946), pp. 33–113; "Vesta extrema" ''Questiunculae Indo-Italicae.12'', ''Revue d'études latins'' 39 (1961), pp. 250–257.&lt;/ref&gt; While Janus has the first place, Vesta has the last, both in theology and in ritual (''Ianus primus, Vesta extrema'').

The last place implies a direct connexion with the situation of the worshipper, in space and in time. Vesta is thence the goddess of the hearth of homes as well as of the city. Her inextinguishable fire is a means for men (as individuals and as a community) to keep in touch with the realm of gods. Thus there is a reciprocal link between the god of beginnings and unending motion, who bestows life to the beings of this world (Cerus Manus) as well as presiding over its end, and the goddess of the hearth of man, which symbolises through fire the presence of life. Vesta is a virgin goddess, but at the same time she is called a 'mother' of Rome: She is thought to be indispensable to the existence and survival of the community.&lt;ref&gt;A. Brelich, ''Vesta'' (Zurich, 1949), "Janus und Vesta" p. 28ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Janus in Etruria ==
It has long been believed that Janus was present among the theonyms on the outer rim of the [[Piacenza Liver]] in case 3, under the name of Aaron. This fact created a problem as the god of beginnings looked to be located in a situation other than the initial, i.e. the first case. After the new readings proposed by A. Maggiani, in case 3 one should read TINS: the difficulty has thus dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;A. Maggiani "Placentia" apud M. Cristofani "Rivista di di epigrafia etrusca", ''Studi Etruschi'' 49 (1981), pp. 235–283, numero 37, pp. 263–267 and "Qualche osservazione sul fegato di Piacenza", ''Studi Etruschi'' 50 (1982) (issued 1984), pp. 53–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron has thence been eliminated from Franciscan theology as this was his only attestation.&lt;ref&gt;C. O. Thulin, ''Die Götter des Martianus Capella und der Bronzeleber von Piacenza'' (Giessen, 1906), pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Maggiani&lt;ref&gt;Above p. 263-4.&lt;/ref&gt; remarks that this earlier identification was in contradiction with the testimony ascribed to Varro by Johannes Lydus that Janus was named ''caelum'' among the Etruscans.&lt;ref&gt;Lydus ''De Mensibus'' IV 2 : cf. also Varro ''Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum'' 16 fr. 230 Cardauns = apud Augustine ''De Civitate Dei'' VII 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, as expected Janus is present in region I of Martianus Capella's division of Heaven and in region XVI, the last one, are to be found the ''{{lang|la|Ianitores terrestres}}'' (along with Nocturnus), perhaps to be identified in [[Limentinus|Forculus, Limentinus and Cardea]],&lt;ref&gt;S. Weinstock, "Martianus Capella", ''Journal of Roman Studies'', p. 106 n. 25 on the grounds of Varro apud Augustine above VII 2 and Johannes Scotus Eriugena ''Annotationes in Marcianum'', edited by C. E. Lutz (Cambridge, Mass., 1939; reprint New York, 1970), p. 29, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; deities strictly related to Janus as his auxiliaries (or perhaps even no more than concrete subdivisions of his functions) as the meaning of their names implies: Forculus is the god of the ''forca'', a ''iugum'', low passage, Limentinus the guardian of the ''limes'', boundary, Cardea the goddess of hinges, here of the gates separating Earth and Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian ''Idolatria'' XV 5; ''De Corona Militis'' XIII 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem posed by the qualifying adjective ''terrestres'' earthly, can be addressed in two different ways.
One hypothesis is that Martianus's depiction implies a descent from Heaven onto Earth.&lt;ref&gt;S. Weinstock "Martianus Capella" in ''Journal of Roman Studies'' p. 104 and 106 .&lt;/ref&gt; However Martianus's depiction does not look to be confined to a division Heaven-Earth as it includes the Underworld and other obscure regions or remote recesses of Heaven. Thence one may argue that the articulation Ianus-Ianitores could be interpreted as connected to the idea of the Gates of Heaven (the ''Synplegades'') which open on the Heaven on one side and on Earth or the Underworld on the other.&lt;ref&gt;S. Weinstock above p. 106 n. 25; E. L. Highbarger, ''The Gates of Dream: An archaeological examination of Vergil, Aeneid VI 893–899'' (Baltimore, 1940); [[A. K. Coomaraswamy]], ''The Door in the Sky'' (Princeton, 1997); M. Eliade ''Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasis'' (Princeton, 2004); G. Capdeville, "Les dieux de Martianus Capella", ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' 213/3 (1996), pp. 293–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

From other archaeological documents though it has become clear that the Etruscans had another god who was double-faced like Janus: Culśanś, of which there is a bronze statuette from [[Cortona]] (now at Cortona Museum). While Janus is a bearded adult, Culśans is an unbearded youth, making his identification with [[Hermes]] look possible.&lt;ref&gt;A. Pfiffig ''Religio Etrusca'' Graz 1975 p. 330-1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his name is also connected with the Etruscan word for doors and gates.&lt;ref&gt;E. Simon, "Gods in harmony", in ''Etruscan Religion'', edited by N. Thomas De Grummond (Univ. of Texas Press, 2006) p. 58. Cf. also goddess Culśu, the gatekeeper of the Underworld, holding a torch and a key, on the sarchophagus of Hasti Afunei from [[Chiusi]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Capdeville, Culśans may also be found on the outer rim of the Piacenza Liver, on case 14, in the compound form ''CULALP'', i.e., "of Culśanś and of [[Alpanu|Alpan(u)]]" on the authority of Pfiffig, but perhaps here it indicates instead the female goddess Culśu, the guardian of the door of the Underworld.&lt;ref&gt;A. Pfiffig above pp. 330–331 on Culśu and p. 280 on Alpanu. In Capdeville's citation it looks the author is unaware of existence of two different gods named Culśanś and Culśu respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the location is not strictly identical, there is some approximation in his situations on the Liver and in Martianus' system.

A. Audin connects the figure of Janus to Culśanś and Turms (Etruscan rendering of Hermes, the Greek god mediator between the different worlds, brought by the Etruscan from the Aegean Sea), considering these last two Etruscan deities as the same.&lt;ref&gt;A. Audin above p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation would then identify Janus with Greek god [[Hermes]]. Etruscan medals from [[Volterra]] too show the double-headed god and the Janus Quadrifrons from Falerii may have an Etruscan origin.&lt;ref&gt;L. Schmitz in W. Smith above p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Association with non-Roman gods ==
[[File:Autun Janus Temple.jpg|thumb|right|The traditional ascription of the "Temple of Janus" at [[Autun]], Burgundy, is disputed.]]

Roman and Greek authors maintained Janus was an exclusively Roman god.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti''I 90; Dionysius Halicarnasseus.&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is excessive according to R. Schilling,&lt;ref&gt;R. Schilling above p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; at least as far as iconography is concerned. A god with two faces appears repeatedly in Sumerian and Babylonian art.&lt;ref&gt;A. Ungnad "Der babylonische Janus" in ''Archiv für Orientforschung'' '''5''' 1929 p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ea (Babilonian) - EnKi (Sumerian).jpg|thumb|left|A [[cylinder seal]] depicting the gods [[Ishtar]], [[Shamash]], [[Enki]], and [[Isimud]], who is shown with two faces (circa 2300 BC)]]
The ancient [[Sumer]]ian deity [[Isimud]] was commonly portrayed with two faces facing in opposite directions. Sumerian depictions of Isimud are often very similar to the typical portrayals of Janus in ancient [[Roman art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ariel Golan|date=2003|title=Prehistoric Religion: Mythology, Symbolism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfgoAAAAYAAJ|page=333|isbn=9789659055500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Janus, however, Isimud is not a god of doorways. Instead, he is the messenger of [[Enki]], the ancient Sumerian god of water and civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rafique Ali Jairazbhoy|date=1965|title=Oriental influences in Western art|publisher=Asia Pub. House|url=https://archive.org/details/orientalinfluenc0000jair|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/orientalinfluenc0000jair/page/227 227]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductions of the image of Isimud, whose Babylonian name was Usimu, on cylinders in Sumero-Accadic art can to be found in H. Frankfort's work ''Cylinder seals'' (London 1939) especially in plates at p.&amp;nbsp;106, 123, 132, 133, 137, 165, 245, 247, 254. On plate XXI, c, Usmu is seen while introducing worshippers to a seated god.

Janus-like heads of gods related to [[Hermes]] have been found in Greece, perhaps suggesting a compound god.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marcadé, "Hermès double", ''Bulletin de Correspondence Hellénique'' 76 (1952), pp. 596–624.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Betham]] argued that the cult arrived from the Middle East and that Janus corresponds to the ''Baal-ianus'' or Belinus of the Chaldeans, sharing a common origin with the [[Oannes (mythology)|Oannes]] of [[Berossus|Berosus]].&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;Royal Numismatic Society, ''Proceedings of the Numismatic Society'', James Fraser, 1837&lt;/ref&gt;

P. Grimal considers Janus a conflation of a Roman god of doorways and an ancient Syro-Hittite uranic cosmogonic god.&lt;ref&gt;P. Grimal above pp. 15–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman statue of the Janus of the Argiletum, traditionally ascribed to Numa, was possibly very ancient, perhaps a sort of [[xoanon]], like the Greek ones of the 8th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;P. J. Riis, ''An introduction to Etruscan art'' (Copenhagen, 1953), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]] the image of double or four faced gods is quite common, as it is a symbolic depiction of the divine power of seeing through space and time. The supreme god [[Brahma]] is represented with four faces. Another instance of a four faced god is the Slavic god [[Svetovid]].

Other analogous or comparable deities of the ''prima'' in [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European religions]] have been analysed by G. Dumézil.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil, "Remarques comparatives sur le dieu scandinave Heimdallr", ''Études Celtiques'' (1959), pp. 263–283; "De Janus à Vesta" in ''Tarpeia'' (Paris, 1947), pp. 31–113 esp. pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; They include the Indian goddess [[Aditi]] who is called ''two-faced'' as she is the one who starts and concludes ceremonies,&lt;ref&gt;Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa ([[Shatapathabrahmana]]) III 2, 4, 16 ''ubhayaḥtaśīrṣṇi'' and Eggeling's note.&lt;/ref&gt; and Scandinavian god [[Heimdallr]]. The theological features of Heimdallr look similar to Janus's: both in space and time he stands at the limits. His abode is at the limits of Earth, at the extremity of Heaven; he is the protector of the gods; his birth is at the beginning of time; he is the forefather of mankind, the generator of classes and the founder of the social order. Nonetheless he is inferior to the sovereign god [[Oðinn]]: the ''Minor Völuspá'' defines his relationship to Oðinn almost with the same terms as those in which Varro defines that of Janus, god of the ''prima'' to Jupiter, god of the ''summa'': Heimdallr is born as the ''firstborn '' (''primigenius'', ''var einn borinn í árdaga''), Oðinn is born as the ''greatest'' (''maximus'', ''var einn borinn öllum meiri'').&lt;ref&gt;''Hyndluljóð'' strophe 37 and 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Analogous Iranian ''formulae'' are to be found in an [[Avestic]] ''gāthā'' ([[Gathas]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Yasna]] 45 first verses of strophes 2, 4 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In other towns of ancient Latium the function of presiding over beginnings was probably performed by other deities of feminine sex, notably the ''[[Fortuna]] Primigenia'' of [[Praeneste]].

In the Middle Ages, Janus was taken as the symbol of [[Genoa]], whose Medieval Latin name was ''Ianua'', as well as of other European communes.&lt;ref&gt;T. O. De Negri ''Storia di Genova'' Firenze 2003 p. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''comune'' of Selvazzano di Dentro near [[Padua]] has a grove and an altar of Janus depicted on its standard, but their existence is unproved.

In [[demonology]], Janus is corrupted into [[Bifrons (demon)|Bifrons]], and is described by grimoires such as ''[[The Lesser Key of Solomon]]'' as a demonic earl in charge of moving bodies into graves and lighting candles over them, possibly suggesting the retention of Janus' role as a deity of endings and guardian of passages.

In Act I Scene 1 of Shakespeare's ''[[Merchant of Venice]]'' Salarino refers to the two headed Janus while failing to find the reason of Antonio's melancholy. As well, in Act I Scene 2 of Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'', Iago invokes the name of Janus after the failure of his plot to undo the titular character.

In her 1921 book ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'', folklorist [[Margaret Murray]] claimed that evidence found in records of the [[early modern witch trials]] showed the witches' god, usually identified in the records as [[the Devil]], was in fact often a male priest dressed in a double mask representing Janus. Murray traced the presence of a man dressed with a mask on the back of his head at some witch meetings to confessions of accused witches in the [[Pyrenees]] region, and one statement in particular that the leader of the witches appeared "''comme le dieu Janus''" ("as the god Janus"). Via the etymology given by James Frazier, Murray further connected the figure on Janus or Dianus in the witch-cult with the more well known goddess of witchcraft, [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].&lt;ref name=murray1921&gt;Murray, Margaret. 1921. [https://archive.org/details/witchcultinweste00murr ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'']&lt;/ref&gt; Both Murray's contemporaries and modern scholars have argued that Murray's hypothesis and the connections she drew between Janus and Diana, and linking the early modern witch trials with ancient pagan beliefs, are dubious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Margaret Murray: Who Believed Her and Why? |last=Simpson |first=Jacqueline |year=1994 |journal=Folklore |volume=105 |pages=89–96 |jstor=1260633 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Janus Society]] was an early [[homophile movement|homophile]] organization founded in 1962 and based in [[Philadelphia]]. It is notable as the publisher of ''[[Drum (American magazine)|DRUM]]'' magazine, one of the earliest gay-interest publications in the United States and most widely circulated in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender history in America|date=2004|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons/Thomson/Gale|others=Stein, Marc.|isbn=0684312611|location=New York, NY|oclc=52819577}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for its role in organizing many of the nation's [[List of LGBT actions in the United States prior to the Stonewall riots|earliest gay rights demonstrations]].&lt;ref&gt;Loughery, John (1998).

The [[Society of Janus]] is the second [[BDSM]] organization founded in the United States (after [[The Eulenspiegel Society]]&lt;ref name="Weiss2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margot Weiss|title=Techniques of Pleasure: BDSM and the Circuits of Sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dR7bTc1aXbcC&amp;pg=PA8|date=20 December 2011|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-5159-7|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and is a San Francisco, California based BDSM education and support group. It was founded in August 1974 by the late [[Cynthia Slater]] and Larry Olsen.  According to the Leather Hall of Fame biography of Slater, she said of the Society of Janus:&lt;ref name="LHF"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cynthia Slater - Leather Hall of Fame |url=https://leatherhalloffame.com/inductees-list/21-cynthia-slater |access-date=2022-08-25 |website=leatherhalloffame.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There were three basic reasons why we chose Janus. First of all, Janus has two faces, which we interpreted as the duality of [[sadomasochism|SM]] (one’s dominant and submissive sides). Second, he’s the Roman god of portals, and more importantly, of beginnings and endings. To us, it represents the beginning of one’s acceptance of self, the beginning of freedom from guilt, and the eventual ending of self-loathing and fear over one’s SM desires. And third, Janus is the Roman god of war—the war we fight against stereotypes commonly held against us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the 1987 [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] novel ''[[The Janus Man]]'' by British novelist [[Raymond Harold Sawkins]], Janus is used as a metaphor for a Soviet agent infiltrated into British Secret Intelligence Service – "The Janus Man who faces both East and West".

In the 1995 spy film ''[[GoldenEye]]'' in the James Bond film series, main antagonist Alec Trevelyan calls himself code name "Janus" after he betrays Bond and subsequently MI6 after learning he is a Lienz Cossack. Bond, portrayed by [[Pierce Brosnan]], goes on to state "Hence, Janus. The two-faced Roman god come to life" after learning of Trevelyan's betrayal.

The [[University of Maryland]]'s undergraduate history journal, created in 2000, is named ''Janus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janus.umd.edu/ |title=Janus: the University of Maryland Undergraduate History Journal |publisher=Janus.umd.edu |date=7 March 2011 |access-date=16 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cats with the congenital disorder [[Diprosopus]], which causes the face to be partly or completely duplicated on the head, are known as [[Diprosopus#Animals|Janus cats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/30/two-faced-cat-guinness-world-record | work=The Guardian | first=Cherry | last=Wilson | title=Two-faced cat is a record breaker | date=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, the character Deceit from the series ''[[Sanders Sides]]'', created by [[Thomas Sanders (entertainer)|Thomas Sanders]], in the episode "Putting Others First", revealed his name to be Janus.

In [[Cassandra Clare]]'s ''[[The Shadowhunter Chronicles]]'', the counterpart of Jace Herondale from an alternate dimension called Thule, chooses the name "Janus" for himself after the Roman god Janus.

[[Janus particles]] are engineered micro- or nano-scopic particles possessing two distinct faces which have distinct physical or chemical properties.

''Janus'' is the name of a [[Janus (time-reversible computing programming language)|time-reversible programming language]]. It is also the name of a [[Janus (concurrent constraint programming language)|concurrent constraint programming language]].

'''Sol''' is the personification of the [[Sun]] and a god in [[ancient Roman religion]]. It was long thought that Rome actually had two different, consecutive [[solar deity|sun gods]]: The first, Sol Indiges ({{lang-la|the deified sun}}), was thought to have been unimportant, disappearing altogether at an early period. Only in the late [[Roman Empire]], scholars argued, did the solar cult re-appear with the arrival in Rome of the Syrian [[Sol Invictus]] ({{lang-la|the unconquered sun}}), perhaps under the influence of the [[Mithraic mysteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cult of Sol Invictus |id=EPRO 223 |last=Halsberghe |first=Gaston |publisher=Brill |year=1972 |location=Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publications dating back to the mid 90s have challenged the notion of two different sun gods in Rome, pointing to the abundant evidence for the continuity of the cult of Sol, and the lack of any clear differentiation – either in name or depiction – between the "early" and "late" Roman sun god.&lt;ref name=Hijmans1996&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hijmans |first=Steven |year=1996 |title=The Sun which did not rise in the East: The cult of Sol Invictus in the light of non-literary evidence |journal=Babesch |volume=71 |pages=115–150 |doi=10.2143/BAB.71.0.2002277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sonnenkult und Kaisertum von den Severern bis zu Constantin I.

==Etymology==
{{see also|Proto-Indo-European mythology}}
The Latin ''sol'' for "[[Sun]]" is believed to originate in the [[Proto-Indo-European language]], as a continuation of the [[heteroclitic]] ''*Seh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ul- / *Sh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-en-'', and thus cognate to other solar deities in other [[Indo-European languages]]: Germanic ''[[Sól (sun)|Sol]]'', Sanskrit ''[[Surya]]'', Greek ''[[Helios]]'', Lithuanian ''[[Saule (Lithuanian mythology)|Saulė]]''.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]]'', p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt; Also compare Latin ''sol'' to Etruscan ''[[Helios#Usil, the Etruscan Helios|usil]]''. Today, [[Romance language]]s still use reflexes of ''sol'' (e.g., [[Italian language|Italian]] ''sole'' and [[French language|French]] ''soleil'') as the main word for "sun".{{efn|''Sol'', borrowed from Latin, is used in contemporary [[English language|English]] by [[astronomer]]s and many [[science fiction]] authors as the proper name of the Sun to distinguish it from other [[star]]s which may be suns for their own [[planetary system]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} }}

==In the Roman Republic==
According to Roman sources, the worship of Sol was introduced by [[Titus Tatius]] shortly after the foundation of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De Lingua'', 5.68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;August, ''de Civ. Dei'', iv. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Virgil]] he is the grandfather of [[Latinus]], the son of Sol's daughter [[Circe]] who lived not far from Rome at Monte Circeo.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'', 12, 161–164.&lt;/ref&gt; A shrine to Sol stood on the banks of the Numicius, near many important shrines of early Latin religion.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Nat. Hist''., III 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome Sol had an "old" temple in the [[Circus Maximus]] according to [[Tacitus]] (56–117&amp;nbsp;CE),&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''Annals'', 15, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; and this temple remained important in the first three centuries&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''de Spect'', 8.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an old shrine for Sol on the [[Quirinal hill|Quirinal]], where an annual sacrifice was offered to Sol Indiges on August&amp;nbsp;9 to commemorate [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s victory at Pharsala (48&amp;nbsp;BCE).{{efn|"a.d. V Idus Augustas: Soli Indigeti in colle Quirinali Feriae quod eo die Gaius Caesar Gai filius Pharsali devicit"&lt;br/&gt; "August&amp;nbsp;9: Festival for Sol Indiges on the Quirinal Hill because on that day Gaius Caesar, son of Gaius, was victorious at Pharsala" – Quintilian.&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian, ''Inst'', 1,7,12; ''Fasti Amiternini''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a.d. V Idus Augustas: Solis Indigetis in colle Quirinali Sacrificium Publicum&lt;ref&gt;''Fasti Vallensis''; cf. ''Fasti Maffeiani'', and ''Fasti Allifani''.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The Roman ritual calendars or [[fasti]] also mention a feast for Sol Indiges on December&amp;nbsp;11, and a sacrifice for Sol and Luna on August&amp;nbsp;28. Traditionally, scholars have considered ''Sol Indiges''{{efn|''Sol Indiges'' is variously translated as "the native sun" or "the invoked sun" – the etymology and meaning of the word "indiges" is disputed.}} to represent an earlier, more agrarian form in which the Roman god Sol was worshipped, and considered him to be very different from the late Roman Sol Invictus, who they believed was a predominantly Syrian deity. Neither the epithet "indiges" (which fell out of use sometime after Caesar) nor the epithet "invictus" are used with any consistency however, making it impossible to differentiate between the two.&lt;ref&gt;''See the wikipedia article'' [[Sol Invictus]]; ''see also'' [[Di indigetes]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sol Invictus==

{{main|Sol Invictus}}
''Sol Invictus'' (English translated as "Unconquered Sun") was long thought to have been a foreign [[official religion|state-supported]] [[sun god]] introduced from either [[Emesa]] or [[Palmyra]] in Syria by the emperor [[Aurelian]] in 274 and overshadowing other Eastern cults in importance,&lt;ref&gt;A typical example of this line of thought can be found in: {{cite journal |first=Allan S. |last=Hoey |title=Official policy towards oriental cults in the Roman army |journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association |volume=70 |year=1939 |pages=456–481, esp. p&amp;nbsp;479ff|doi=10.2307/283102 |jstor=283102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until the abolition of [[Religion in ancient Rome|classical Roman religion]] under [[Theodosius I]].

According to a single, late source, the Romans held a festival on December&amp;nbsp;21 of ''Dies Natalis Invicti'', "the birthday of the unconquered one." Most scholars assume Sol Invictus was meant, although our source for this festival does not state so explicitly.{{efn|The Natalis Invicti is mentioned only in the ''Calendar of Philocalus'', which dates to 354&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=ccel.org |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pearse/morefathers/files/chronography_of_354_06_calendar.htm |title=Chronography of the 354-06 calendar}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

December&amp;nbsp;25 was commonly indicated as the date of the [[winter solstice]],{{efn|When [[Julius Caesar]] introduced the [[Julian Calendar]] in 45&amp;nbsp;BCE, December&amp;nbsp;25 was approximately the date of the solstice. In modern times, the solstice falls on December&amp;nbsp;21 or 22.}} with the first detectable lengthening of daylight hours. The [[Chronography of 354|Philocalian calendar]] of AD&amp;nbsp;354, part VI, gives a festival of {{sc|Natalis Invicti}} on 25&amp;nbsp;December. There is limited evidence that this festival was celebrated before the mid-4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff (2001) 174–177 {{full citation| date=June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"An inscription of unique interest from the reign of Licinius embodies the official prescription for the annual celebration by his army of a festival of Sol Invictus on December&amp;nbsp;19".&lt;ref&gt;Hoey (1939) 480 {{full citation| date=June 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription&lt;ref name=Dessau-nd&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; there have been speculations that the near-solstice date of 25&amp;nbsp;December for [[Christmas]] was selected because it was the date of the [[Roman festival|festival]] of {{sc|Dies Natalis Solis Invicti}}, but historians of late antiquity make no mention of this, and others speculate [[Aurelian]] chose December&amp;nbsp;25 to shadow early Christian celebrations already on the rise.&lt;ref name=McGowan-2002-12&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; When the festival on December&amp;nbsp;25 was instituted is not clear, which makes it hard to assess what impact (if any) it had on the establishment of [[Christmas]].
 
There were also festivals on other days in December, including the 11th (mentioned above), as well as August. Gordon points out that none of these other festivals are linked to astronomical events.&lt;ref name=GordonWallraff2006/&gt;

Throughout the 4th century the cult of Sol continued to be maintained by high-ranking pontiffs, including the renowned [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus]].&lt;ref&gt;CIL VI, 1778, {{cite web |url=http://www1.ku-eichstaett.de/epigr/uah-bilder.php?bild=PH0009413 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-11-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716024900/http://www1.ku-eichstaett.de/epigr/uah-bilder.php?bild=PH0009413 |archive-date=2011-07-16 }} and 1779.{{cite web |url=http://www1.ku-eichstaett.de/epigr/uah-bilder.php?bild=PH0005618;PH0005615;PH0005616;PH0005617 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-12-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716024907/http://www1.ku-eichstaett.de/epigr/uah-bilder.php?bild=PH0005618;PH0005615;PH0005616;PH0005617 |archive-date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connection to Emperors ==
[[File:Antoninianus-Aurelianus-Palmyra-s3262.jpg|thumb|On the left, the Roman Emperor [[Aurelian]] with a radiate crown and on the right, a depiction Sol]]
According to the ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'', [[Elagabalus]], the teenaged Severan heir, adopted the name of his deity and brought his cult image from Emesa to Rome. Once installed as emperor, he neglected Rome's traditional State deities and promoted his own as Rome's most powerful deity. This ended with his murder in 222. The ''Historia Augusta'' equates the deity Elagabalus with Jupiter and Sol: ''fuit autem Heliogabali vel Iovis vel Solis sacerdos'', "He was also a priest of Heliogabalus, or [[Jove]], or Sol".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Edition Of The Latin Text And English Translation|date=2010-01-01|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/ej.9789004177017.i-178.20|work=Hugo Grotius Mare Liberum 1609–2009|pages=1–25|publisher=Brill {{!}} Nijhoff|doi=10.1163/ej.9789004177017.i-178.20|isbn=9789047430452|access-date=2021-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this has been seen as an attempt to import the Syrian sun god to Rome,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Halsberghe|first=Gaston|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/9789004296251|title=The Cult of Sol Invictus|date=1972-01-01|publisher=BRILL|doi=10.1163/9789004296251|isbn=978-90-04-29625-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Roman cult of Sol had existed in Rome at least since the early [[Roman Republic|Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HIJMANS|first=Steven E.|date=1996-12-01|title=The Sun which Did not Rise in the East|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2143/bab.71.0.2002277|journal=Babesch |volume=71|pages=115–150|doi=10.2143/bab.71.0.2002277|issn=0165-9367}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Berrens|first=Stephan|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57010712|title=Sonnenkult und Kaisertum von den Severern bis zu Constantin I.

As the Cult of Sol grew and Sol took on attributes of other deities, Sol began to be used as a way to display imperial power.

== Identification with other deities ==
Sol was most notably identified with [[Phoebus]] [[Apollo]]; such equation famously occurs in [[Varro]] and [[Ovid]]. The Greek assimilation of [[Apollo]] and [[Helios]] was already established in Rome by the end of the republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hijmans |first=Steven |year=2004 |article=Sol and Luna in the ''Carmen Saeculare'': An iconographic perspective |url=https://www.academia.edu/987265 |title=Metamorphic Reflections: Essays presented to Ben Hijmans at his 75th&amp;nbsp;birthday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various Roman philosophers speculated on the nature of the sun, without arriving at any consensus. A typical example is [[Nigidius]], a scholar of the 1st&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BCE. His works have not survived, but writing five centuries later, [[Macrobius]] reports that Nigidius argued that Sol was to be identified with [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]] and that he had a counterpart, [[Jana (mythology)|Jana]], who was [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]]. As such, they were to be regarded as the highest of the gods, receiving their sacrifices before all the others.{{refn|[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'', i. 9.&lt;ref&gt;An echo of Nigidius' views, perhaps to be found in [[Cicero]], ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'', ii. 27&lt;/ref&gt;}} Such speculations appear to have been restricted to an erudite elite and had no impact on the well-attested cult of Sol as independent deity: No ancient source aside from Macrobius mentions the equation of Sol with Janus.

Sol appears many times in depictions of Mithras, such as the [[Tauroctony]] of Mithras killing the bull, and looking at Sol over his shoulder.&lt;ref name="The Roman Cult of Mithras"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Clauss|first1=Manfred|last2=Gordon|first2=Richard|date=2017-09-25|title=The Roman Cult of Mithras|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315085333|doi=10.4324/9781315085333|isbn=9781315085333}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appear in other scenes together from Mithras ascending behind Sol's chariot, shaking hands and some depictions of Sol kneeling to Mithras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Beck|first=Roger|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315096513|title=Beck on Mithraism|date=2020-11-06|publisher=Routledge|doi=10.4324/9781315096513|isbn=978-1-351-57433-4|s2cid=228869848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mithras was known as Sol Invictus even though Sol is a separate deity, a paradoxical relationship where they are each other but separate.&lt;ref name="The Roman Cult of Mithras"/&gt; They are separate deities but due to some similarities a connection between them can be created which can lead to one over taking the other.

'''Jupiter''' ({{lang-la|Iūpiter}} or {{lang|la|Iuppiter}},&lt;ref&gt;''Iūpiter'' is thought to be the historically older form and ''Iuppiter'', to have arosen through the so-called ''littera''-rule.

''Iovis'' {{IPA-la|ˈjɔwɪs|}}), is the [[sky god|god of the sky]] and [[god of thunder|thunder]], and [[Pantheon (gods)|king of the gods]] in [[ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman mythology|mythology]]. Jupiter was the chief deity of Roman state religion throughout the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] eras, until [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christianity became the dominant religion of the Empire]]. In Roman mythology, he negotiates with [[Numa Pompilius]], the second [[king of Rome]], to establish principles of Roman religion such as offering, or sacrifice.

Jupiter is usually thought to have originated as a sky god. His identifying implement is the [[thunderbolt]] and his primary sacred animal is the eagle,&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''Naturalis Historia'' X 16. A. Alföldi ''Zu den römischen Reiterscheiben''  in ''Germania''  '''30'''  1952 p. 188 and n. 11 as cited by G. Dumézil ''La religion reomaine archaïque'' Paris 1974 2nd ed., It. tr. Milan 1977 (hereafter cited as ARR) p. 215 n. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; which held precedence over other birds in the taking of [[auspices]]&lt;ref&gt;Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' II 374.&lt;/ref&gt; and became one of the most common symbols of the [[Roman army]] (see [[Aquila (Roman)|Aquila]]). The two emblems were often combined to represent the god in the form of an eagle holding in its claws a thunderbolt, frequently seen on Greek and Roman coins.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Roman Coins, see e.g. reverse of "Consecratio" coin of Emperor Commodus &amp; coin of Ptolemy V Epiphanes minted c. 204–180 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; As the sky-god, he was a divine witness to oaths, the sacred trust on which justice and good government depend. Many of his functions were focused on the [[Capitoline Hill]], where the [[Arx (Roman)|citadel]] was located. In the [[Capitoline Triad]], he was the central guardian of the state with [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]]. His sacred tree was the oak.
[[File:Jupiter statue, Vaticana.jpg|thumb|200px|Statue of Jupiter, Vatican, Rome.]]
The Romans regarded Jupiter as the [[interpretatio graeca|equivalent]] of the Greek [[Zeus]],&lt;ref name="Lar"&gt;''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Latin literature]] and [[Roman art]], the myths and iconography of Zeus are adapted under the name ''Iuppiter''. In the Greek-influenced tradition, Jupiter was the brother of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], the Roman equivalents of [[Poseidon]] and [[Hades]] respectively. Each presided over one of the three realms of the universe: sky, the waters, and the underworld. The [[Italic peoples|Italic]] '''Diespiter''' was also a sky god who manifested himself in the daylight, usually identified with Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;''Diespiter'' should not be confused with ''[[Dis pater]],'' but the two names do cause confusion even in some passages of ancient literature; P.T. Eden, [[commentary (philology)|commentary]] on the ''[[Apocolocyntosis]]'' (Cambridge University Press, 1984, 2002), pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tinia]] is usually regarded as his [[Etruscan religion|Etruscan]] counterpart.&lt;ref name="pallottino"&gt;[[Massimo Pallottino]], "Etruscan Daemonology," p. 41, and&lt;br/&gt;Robert Schilling, "Rome," pp. 44 and 63,&lt;br/&gt;both in (1981, 1992) ''Roman and European Mythologies'', University of Chicago Press, 1992, transl. from the 1981 French edition;&lt;br/&gt;Giuliano Bonfante and [[Larissa Bonfante]], (1983, 2003) ''The Etruscan Language: An Introduction'', Manchester University Press rev. ed., pp. 24, 84, 85, 219, 225;&lt;br/&gt;Nancy Thomson de Grummond, (2006), ''Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend'', University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, pp. 19, 53–58 ''et passim'';&lt;br/&gt;[[Jean MacIntosh Turfa]], (2012), ''Divining the Etruscan World: The Brontoscopic Calendar and Religious Practice'' Cambridge University Press, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the state==
The Romans believed that Jupiter granted them supremacy because they had honoured him more than any other people had. Jupiter was "the fount of the [[auspices]] upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; He personified the divine authority of Rome's highest offices, internal organization, and external relations. His image in the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] Capitol bore [[regalia]] associated with [[Kings of Rome|Rome's ancient kings]] and the highest [[Roman consul|consular]] and [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial honours]].&lt;ref&gt;Orlin, in Rüpke (ed), 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The consuls swore their oath of office in Jupiter's name, and honoured him on the annual ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|feriae]]'' of the Capitol in September. To thank him for his help, and to secure his continued support, they sacrificed a white ox ''(bos mas)'' with gilded horns.&lt;ref&gt;Scheid, in Rüpke (ed), 263–271; G. Dumézil ARR It. tr. p. 181 citing [[Jean Bayet]] ''Les annales de Tite Live'' édition G. Budé vol. III 1942 Appendix V p. 153 and n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar sacrificial offering was made by [[Roman Triumph|triumphal generals]], who surrendered the tokens of their victory at the feet of Jupiter's statue in the Capitol. Some scholars have viewed the ''triumphator'' as embodying (or impersonating) Jupiter in the triumphal procession.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil 1977 p. 259 note 4: cf. Servius ''Eclogae'' X 27  "''unde etiam triumphantes habent omnia insignia Iovis, sceptrum palmatamque togam''" "wherefore also the triumphing commanders have all the insignia of Jupiter, the sceptre and the toga palmata'". On the interpretation of the triumphal dress and of the triumph, Larissa Bonfante has offered an interpretation based on Etruscan documents in her article : "Roman Triumphs and Etruscan Kings: the Changing Face of the Triumph" in  ''Journal of Roman Studies'' '''60''' 1970 pp. 49–66 and tables I–VIII. [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]] rehearses various views of the ''triumphator'' as god or king in ''The Roman Triumph'' (Harvard University Press, 2007), pp. 226–232, and expresses skepticism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jupiter's association with kingship and sovereignty was reinterpreted as Rome's form of government changed. Originally, [[Kings of Rome|Rome was ruled by kings]]; after the monarchy was abolished and the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] established, religious prerogatives were transferred to the ''patres'', the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician ruling class]]. Nostalgia for the kingship ''(affectatio regni)'' was considered treasonous. Those suspected of harbouring monarchical ambitions were punished, regardless of their service to the state. In the 5th century BC, the ''triumphator'' [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]] was sent into exile after he drove a chariot with a team of four white horses ''([[quadriga]])''—an honour reserved for Jupiter himself. When [[Marcus Manlius Capitolinus|Marcus Manlius]], whose defense of the Capitol against the [[Sack of Rome (387 BC)|invading Gauls]] had earned him the name ''Capitolinus'', was accused of regal pretensions, he was executed as a traitor by being cast from the [[Tarpeian Rock]]. His house on the Capitoline Hill was razed, and it was decreed that no patrician should ever be allowed to live there.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil 1977 citing Livy V 23, 6 and VI 17, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Capitoline Jupiter represented a continuity of royal power from the [[Roman Kingdom|Regal period]], and conferred power to the [[Roman Magistrates|magistrates]] who paid their respects to him.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above 1977 p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Conflict of the Orders]], Rome's [[plebs|plebeians]] demanded the right to hold political and religious office. During their first ''[[Secessio plebis|secessio]]'' (similar to a [[general strike]]), they withdrew from the city and threatened to found their own. When they agreed to come back to Rome they vowed the hill where they had retreated to Jupiter as symbol and guarantor of the unity of the Roman ''res publica''.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil 1977 p.  citing Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' VI 90, 1; Festus s.v. p. 414 L 2nd.&lt;/ref&gt; Plebeians eventually became eligible for all the [[Roman Magistrates|magistracies]] and most priesthoods, but the high priest of Jupiter ''([[Flamen Dialis]])'' remained the preserve of patricians.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War'' (University of California Press, 2005, 2006), p. 159 ''et passim.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flamen and Flaminica Dialis===
[[File:Ara pacis fregio lato ovest 2 B.JPG|thumb|left|Detail of [[relief]] from the [[Ara Pacis|Augustan Altar of Peace]], showing ''flamines'' wearing the pointed ''[[Apex (headdress)|apex]]''|alt=Bas-relief of five Roman priests]]
{{Main|Flamen Dialis}}
Jupiter was served by the patrician Flamen Dialis, the highest-ranking member of the ''[[Flamen|flamines]],'' a [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|college]] of fifteen priests in the official public cult of Rome, each of whom was devoted to a particular deity. His wife, the Flaminica Dialis, had her own duties, and presided over the sacrifice of a ram to Jupiter on each of the ''[[Roman calendar#Nundinal cycle|nundinae]]'', the "market" days of a calendar cycle, comparable to a week.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 1.16.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple were required to marry by the exclusive patrician ritual ''[[confarreatio]]'', which included a sacrifice of [[spelt]] bread to Jupiter Farreus (from ''far'', "wheat, grain").&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Dillon and Lynda Garland, "Religion in the Roman Republic," in ''Ancient Rome: From the Early Republic to the Assassination of Julius Caesar'' (Routledge, 2005), pp. 127, 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of Flamen Dialis was circumscribed by several unique ritual prohibitions, some of which shed light on the sovereign nature of the god himself.&lt;ref&gt;Most of the information about the Flamen Dialis is preserved by [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Attic Nights'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/10*.html#15 X 15.]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the ''flamen'' may remove his clothes or ''[[Apex (headdress)|apex]]'' (his pointed hat) only when under a roof, in order to avoid showing himself naked to the sky—that is, "as if under the eyes of Jupiter" as god of the heavens. Every time the Flaminica saw a lightning bolt or heard a clap of thunder (Jupiter's distinctive instrument), she was prohibited from carrying on with her normal routine until she placated the god.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 16, 8: ''flaminica quotiens tonitrua audisset feriata erat, donec placasset deos.'' The adjective ''feriatus'', related to ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|feriae]]'', "holy days," pertains to keeping a holiday, and hence means "idle, unemployed," not performing one's usual tasks.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some privileges of the ''flamen'' of Jupiter may reflect the regal nature of Jupiter: he had the use of the [[curule chair]],&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 20, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the only priest ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sacerdos]])'' who was preceded by a [[lictor]]&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''Quaestiones Romanae'' 113.&lt;/ref&gt; and had a seat in the [[Roman senate|senate]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy XXVII 8, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Other regulations concern his ritual purity and his separation from the military function; he was forbidden to ride a horse or see the army outside the sacred boundary of Rome ''([[pomerium]]).'' Although he served the god who embodied the sanctity of the oath, it was not religiously permissible ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#fas|fas]])'' for the Dialis to swear an oath.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, 10.15.5: ''item iurare Dialem fas numquam est''; [[Robert E.A. Palmer]], "The Deconstruction of Mommsen on Festus 462/464L, or the Hazards of Interpretation," in ''Imperium sine fine: T. Robert S. Broughton and the Roman Republic'' (Franz Steiner, 1996), p. 85; Francis X. Ryan, ''Rank and Participation in the Republican Senate'' (Franz Steiner, 1998), p. 165. The [[Vestals]] and the Flamen Dialis were the only Roman citizens who could not be compelled to swear an oath (Aulus Gellius 10.15.31); Robin Lorsch Wildfang, ''Rome's Vestal Virgin: A Study of Rome's Vestal Priestesses in the Late Republic and Early Empire'' (Routledge, 2006), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; He could not have contacts with anything dead or connected with death: corpses, funerals, funeral fires, raw meat. This set of restrictions reflects the fulness of life and absolute freedom that are features of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil 1977 p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Augurs===
The ''augures publici'', [[augurs]] were a college of ''sacerdotes'' who were in charge of all inaugurations and of the performing of ceremonies known as ''auguria''. Their creation was traditionally ascribed to [[Romulus]]. They were considered the only official interpreters of Jupiter's will, thence they were essential to the very existence of the Roman State as Romans saw in Jupiter the only source of state authority.

===Fetials===
The [[fetials]] were a college of 20 men devoted to the religious administration of international affairs of state.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 94–96, 169, 192, 502–504; G. Wissowa ''Religion un Kultus der Römer'' Munich 1912 p. 104 Hereafter cited as RK). Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Rom. Ant.'' I 21, 1 ; Livy I 32, 4. See also ''[[ius gentium]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Their task was to preserve and apply the fetial law ''(ius fetiale)'', a complex set of procedures aimed at ensuring the protection of the gods in Rome's relations with foreign states. [[Iuppiter Lapis]] is the god under whose protection they act, and whom the chief fetial ''(pater patratus)'' invokes in the rite concluding a treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 24, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; If a [[declaration of war]] ensues, the fetial calls upon Jupiter and [[Quirinus]], the heavenly, earthly and [[chthonic]] gods as witnesses of any potential violation of the ''ius''. He can then declare war within 33 days.&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 32, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The action of the fetials falls under Jupiter's jurisdiction as the divine defender of good faith. Several emblems of the fetial office pertain to Jupiter. The ''silex'' was the stone used for the fetial sacrifice, housed in the Temple of [[Feretrius|Iuppiter Feretrius]], as was their sceptre. Sacred herbs ''(sagmina)'', sometimes identified as [[vervain]], had to be taken from the nearby [[Arx (Roman)|citadel ''(arx)'']] for their ritual use.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 502–504 and 169. {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=104}}, citing Paulus p. 92 M.; Servius  ''Aeneis'' XII 206; Livy I 24, 3–8; IX 5, 3; XXX 43, 9; Festus p. 321 M.; Pliny NH XXII 5; Marcianus apud ''Digesta'' I 8, 8 par. 1; Servius ''Aeneis''  VIII 641; XII 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jupiter and religion in the secessions of the plebs===

The role of Jupiter in the [[conflict of the orders]] is a reflection of the religiosity of the Romans. On one side, the patricians were able to naturally claim the support of the supreme god as they held the [[auspices]] of the State. On the other side, the [[pleb]]s (plebeians) argued that, as Jupiter was the source of justice, they had his favor because their cause was just.

The first secession was caused by the excessive debt burden on the plebs. The legal institute of the ''[[nexum]]'' permitted a debtor to become a slave of his creditor. The plebs argued the debts had become unsustainable because of the expenses of the wars wanted by the patricians. As the senate did not accede to the proposal of a total debt remission advanced by dictator and augur [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] the plebs retired on the Mount Sacer, a hill located three Roman miles to the North-northeast of Rome, past the Nomentan bridge on river [[Anio]].&lt;ref&gt;Varro in his ''Lingua Latina'' V writes of "Crustumerian secession" ("''a secessione Crustumerina''"）.&lt;/ref&gt; The place is windy and was usually the site of rites of divination performed by haruspices. The senate in the end sent a delegation composed of ten members with full powers of making a deal with the plebs, of which were part [[Menenius Agrippa]] and Manius Valerius. It was Valerius, according to the inscription found at Arezzo in 1688 and written on the order of Augustus as well as other literary sources, that brought the plebs down from the Mount, after the secessionists had consecrated it to ''Jupiter Territor'' and built an altar (''ara'') on its summit. The fear of the wrath of Jupiter was an important element in the solution of the crisis. The consecration of the Mount probably referred to its summit only. The ritual requested the participation of both an augur (presumably Manius Valerius himself) and a pontifex.&lt;ref&gt;F. Vallocchia "Manio Valerio Massimo dittatore ed augure" in ''Diritto @ Storia'' '''7''' 2008 (online).&lt;/ref&gt;

The second secession was caused by the autocratic and arrogant behaviour of the ''[[decemviri]]'', who had been charged by the Roman people with writing down the laws in use till then kept secret by the patrician magistrates and the ''sacerdotes''. All magistracies and the tribunes of the plebs had resigned in advance. The task resulted in the XII Tables, which though concerned only private law. The plebs once again retreated to the Sacer Mons: this act besides recalling the first secession was meant to seek the protection of the supreme god. The secession ended with the resignation of the ''decemviri'' and an amnesty for the rebellious soldiers who had deserted from their camp near Mount Algidus while warring against the Volscians, abandoning the commanders. The amnesty was granted by the senate and guaranteed by the ''pontifex maximus'' Quintus Furius (in Livy's version) (or Marcus Papirius) who also supervised the nomination of the new tribunes of the plebs, then gathered on the Aventine Hill. The role played by the ''pontifex maximus'' in a situation of vacation of powers is a significant element underlining the religious basis and character of the ''tribunicia potestas''.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. A. Rinolfi "Plebe, pontefice massimo, tribuni della plebe: a proposito di Livio 3.54.5–14" in ''Diritto @ Storia'' '''5''' 2006 (online).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths and legends==
[[File:Zeus pompei.JPG|thumb|right|Jupiter in a wall painting from [[Pompeii]], with eagle and globe, 62–79 AD|alt=Painting of a bearded, seated Jupiter, unclothed from the waist up and holding a staff]]
A dominant line of scholarship has held that Rome lacked a body of myths in its earliest period, or that this original mythology has been irrecoverably obscured by the influence of the [[Greek mythology|Greek narrative tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], "Characteristic Traits of Ancient Roman Religion," in ''Pietas: Selected Studies in Roman Religion'' (Brill, 1980), p. 241, ascribing the view that there was no early Roman mythology to [[Walter Friedrich Otto|W.F. Otto]] and his school.&lt;/ref&gt; After the influence of Greek culture on Roman culture, Latin literature and iconography reinterpreted the myths of Zeus in depictions and narratives of Jupiter. In the legendary history of Rome, Jupiter is often connected to kings and kingship.

===Birth===
Jupiter is depicted as the twin of Juno in a statue at [[Praeneste]] that showed them nursed by [[Fortuna|Fortuna Primigenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Described by [[Cicero]], ''[[De divinatione]]'' 2.85, as cited by R. Joy Littlewood, "Fortune," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), vol. 1, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription that is also from Praeneste, however, says that Fortuna Primigenia was Jupiter's first-born child.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 1.60, as cited by Littlewood, "Fortune," p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jacqueline Champeaux sees this contradiction as the result of successive different cultural and religious phases, in which a wave of influence coming from the Hellenic world made Fortuna the daughter of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;J. Champeaux ''Fortuna. Le culte de la Fortune à Rome et dans le monde romain. I Fortuna dans la religion archaïque'' 1982 Rome: Publications de l'Ecole Française de Rome; as reviewed by John Scheid in ''Revue de l' histoire des religions'' 1986 '''203''' 1: pp. 67–68 (Comptes rendus).&lt;/ref&gt; The childhood of Zeus is an important theme in Greek religion, art and literature, but there are only rare (or dubious) depictions of Jupiter as a child.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), pp. 223–225.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numa Pompilius===
Faced by a period of bad weather endangering the harvest during one early spring, King [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]] resorted to the scheme of asking the advice of the god by evoking his presence.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil 1977 pp. 51–52 and 197.&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded through the help of Picus and Faunus, whom he had imprisoned by making them drunk. The two gods (with a charm) evoked Jupiter, who was forced to come down to earth at the Aventine (hence named ''Iuppiter Elicius'', according to Ovid). After Numa skilfully avoided the requests of the god for human sacrifices, Jupiter agreed to his request to know how lightning bolts are averted, asking only for the substitutions Numa had mentioned: an onion bulb, hairs and a fish. Moreover, Jupiter promised that at the sunrise of the following day he would give to Numa and the Roman people pawns of the ''imperium''. The following day, after throwing three lightning bolts across a clear sky, Jupiter sent down from heaven a shield. Since this shield had no angles, Numa named it ''ancile''; because in it resided the fate of the ''imperium'', he had many copies made of it to disguise the real one. He asked the smith [[Mamurius Veturius]] to make the copies, and gave them to the [[Salii]]. As his only reward, Mamurius expressed the wish that his name be sung in the last of their ''carmina''.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti III'', 284–392. Festus s.v. Mamuri Veturi p. 117 L as cited by Dumézil 1977 p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch gives a slightly different version of the story, writing that the cause of the miraculous drop of the shield was a plague and not linking it with the Roman ''imperium''.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch Numa 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tullus Hostilius===
Throughout his reign, [[Tullus Hostilius|King Tullus]] had a scornful attitude towards religion. His temperament was warlike, and he disregarded religious rites and piety. After conquering the [[Albani people|Albans]] with the duel between the [[Horatii and Curiatii]], Tullus destroyed [[Alba Longa]] and deported its inhabitants to Rome. As [[Livy]] tells the story, omens ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#prodigium|prodigia]])'' in the form of a rain of stones occurred on the [[Alban Mount]] because the deported Albans had disregarded their ancestral rites linked to the sanctuary of Jupiter. In addition to the omens, a voice was heard requesting that the Albans perform the rites. A plague followed and at last the king himself fell ill. As a consequence, the warlike character of Tullus broke down; he resorted to religion and petty, superstitious practices. At last, he found a book by Numa recording a secret rite on how to evoke ''Iuppiter Elicius''. The king attempted to perform it, but since he executed the rite improperly the god threw a lightning bolt which burned down the king's house and killed Tullus.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil 1977 p. 175 citing Livy I 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tarquin the Elder===
When approaching Rome (where Tarquin was heading to try his luck in politics after unsuccessful attempts in his native [[Tarquinii]]), an eagle swooped down, removed his hat, flew screaming in circles, replaced the hat on his head and flew away.  Tarquin's wife [[Tanaquil]] [[augury|interpreted]] this as a sign that he would become king based on the bird, the quadrant of the sky from which it came, the god who had sent it and the fact it touched his hat (an item of clothing placed on a man's most noble part, the head).&lt;ref&gt;R. Bloch ''Prodigi e divinazione nell' antica Roma'' Roma 1973. Citing Livy I 34, 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elder Tarquin is credited with introducing the Capitoline Triad to Rome, by building the so-called Capitolium Vetus. Macrobius writes this issued from his Samothracian mystery beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult==
[[File:Marcusaureliuspannel.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], attended by his family, offers sacrifice outside the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus after his victories in Germany (late 2nd century AD). [[Capitoline Museum]], Rome|alt=Bas=relief of family group, with an animal, outside large building with columns]]

===Sacrifices===
Sacrificial victims (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#hostia|hostiae]]'') offered to Jupiter were the ox (castrated bull), the lamb  (on the Ides, the  ''ovis idulis'') and the [[wikt:wether|wether]] (a castrated goat or castrated ram) (on the Ides of January).&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' I 587–588.&lt;/ref&gt;  The animals were required to be white. The question of the lamb's gender is unresolved; while a sacrificial lamb for a male deity was usually male, for the vintage-opening festival the flamen Dialis sacrificed a [[Sheep|ewe]] lamb to Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Varro LL VI 16. Sacrifices to Jupiter are also broached in Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 10. The issue of the sacrificial victims proper to a god is one of the most vexed topics of Roman religion: cf. Gérard Capdeville "Substitution de victimes dans les sacrifices d'animaux à Rome" in ''MEFRA'' ''' 83'''  2 1971 pp. 283–323. Also G. Dumézil "Quaestiunculae indo-italicae: 11. Iovi tauro verre ariete immolari non licet" in ''Revue d'études latins'' '''39''' 1961 pp. 242–257.&lt;/ref&gt; This rule seems to have had many exceptions, as the sacrifice of a ram on the [[Nundinae]] by the ''flaminica Dialis'' demonstrates.
During one of the crises of the [[Second Punic War|Punic Wars]], Jupiter was offered every animal born that year.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al, Vol 1, 32–36: the consecration made this a "Sacred Spring" ''(ver sacrum).'' The "contract" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals, but any that died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice would count as if already sacrificed. Sacred animals were already assigned to the gods, who ought to protect their own property.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temples===
====Temple of Capitoline Jupiter====
{{main|Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)}}
The Temple of [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] stood on the [[Capitoline Hill]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 258–261.&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter was worshiped there as an individual deity, and with [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]] as part of the [[Capitoline Triad]]. The building was supposedly begun by king [[Tarquinius Priscus]], completed by the last king ([[Tarquinius Superbus]]) and inaugurated in the early days of the Roman Republic (September 13, 509 BC). It was topped with the statues of four horses drawing a [[quadriga]], with Jupiter as charioteer. A large statue of Jupiter stood within; on festival days, its face was painted red. &lt;!-- Need section on images, probably above or below this --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Fasti'', 1.201f.&lt;/ref&gt; In (or near) this temple was the ''Iuppiter Lapis'': the [[Jupiter Stone]], on which oaths could be sworn.

Jupiter's Capitoline Temple probably served as the architectural model for his provincial temples. 
When Hadrian built [[Aelia Capitolina]] on the site of [[Jerusalem]], a temple to Jupiter Capitolinus was erected in the place of the destroyed [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. &lt;!-- Permanent military shrine to Jupiter known as Capitolium (one case only) --&gt;

====Other temples in Rome====
There were two temples in Rome dedicated to ''Iuppiter Stator''; [[Temple of Jupiter Stator (3rd century BC)|the first one]] was built and dedicated in 294 BC by [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] after the third Samnite War. It was located on the ''Via Nova'', below the ''Porta Mugonia'', ancient entrance to the Palatine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=107}}; Livy X 36, 1 and 37, 15 f.&lt;/ref&gt; Legend attributed its founding to Romulus.&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 12; Dionysius of Halicarnassus II 59; Ovid ''Fasti'' VI 793; Cicero ''Catilinaria'' I 33.&lt;/ref&gt; There may have been an earlier shrine ''([[fanum]])'', since the Jupiter cult is attested epigraphically.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=107}}: CIL VI 434, 435; IX 3023, 4534; X59-4; also III 1089.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovid]] places the temple's dedication on June 27, but it is unclear whether this was the original date,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=198}} and n. 1&lt;!-- Wissowa's note 1 or ours? --&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; or the rededication after the restoration by Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Based on the tradition of dedicating Jovian temples on the [[Roman calendar#Months|Ides]]. This assumption is supported by the [[calendar of Philocalus]], which states on the Ides of January (13): ''Iovi Statori c(ircenses) m(issus) XXIV''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Weihealtar für Jupiter.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Altar to Jupiter on the outskirts of legionary fortress, 2nd–3rd century AD. Inscription: "Dedicated by L. Lollius Clarus for himself and his family"|alt=Narrow stone altar, with inscription]]

[[Temple of Jupiter Stator (2nd century BC)|A second temple of ''Iuppiter Stator'']] was built and dedicated by Quintus Caecilus Metellus Macedonicus after his triumph in 146 BC near the [[Circus Flaminius]]. It was connected to [[Temple of Juno Regina (Campus Martius)|the restored temple of ''Iuno Regina'']] with a [[portico]] (''[[Porticus Octaviae|porticus Metelli]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=108}} and n. 1 citing Vitruvius ''De Architectura'' (hereafter Vitruvius) III 1, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Iuppiter Victor'' had a temple dedicated by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges (consul 292 BC)|Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges]] during the third Samnite War in 295 BC. Its location is unknown, but it may be on the Quirinal, on which an inscription reading ''Diovei Victore''&lt;ref&gt;CIL VI 438.&lt;/ref&gt; has been found, or on the Palatine according to the ''Notitia'' in the ''Liber Regionum'' (regio X), which reads: ''aedes Iovis Victoris''. Either might have been dedicated on April 13 or June 13 (days of ''Iuppiter Victor'' and of ''Iuppiter Invictus'', respectively, in Ovid's ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' IV 621 and VI 650.&lt;/ref&gt;
Inscriptions from the imperial age have revealed the existence of an otherwise-unknown temple of  ''Iuppiter Propugnator'' on the Palatine.&lt;ref&gt;Protocols of a sacerdotal ''collegium'': {{harvp|Wissowa|1912}}, citing CIL VI 2004–2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iuppiter Latiaris and Feriae Latinae===
The cult of ''Iuppiter Latiaris'' was the most ancient known cult of the god: it was practised since very remote times near the top of the ''Mons Albanus'' on which the god was venerated as the high protector of the Latin League under the hegemony of [[Alba Longa]].

After the destruction of Alba by king Tullus Hostilius the cult was forsaken.  The god manifested his discontent through the prodigy of a rain of stones: the commission sent by the Roman senate to inquire was also greeted by a rain of stones and heard a loud voice from the grove on the summit of the mount requesting the Albans perform the religious service to the god according to the rites of their country. In consequence of this event the Romans instituted a festival of nine days (''nundinae'').   Nonetheless a plague ensued:  in the end Tullus Hostilius himself was affected and lastly killed by the god with a lightning bolt.&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 31 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was reestablished on its primitive site by the last Roman king Tarquin the Proud under the leadership of Rome.

The ''[[feriae Latinae]]'', or ''[[Latiar]]'' as they were known originally,&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius I 16. This identification has though been challenged by A. Pasqualini.&lt;/ref&gt; were the common festival  (''panegyris'') of the so-called Priscan Latins&lt;ref&gt;Festus s.v. prisci Latini p. : "the Latin towns that existed before the foundation of Rome".&lt;/ref&gt; and of the Albans.&lt;ref&gt;L. Schmitz in W. Smith  ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' London 1875 s. v. Feriae p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt; Their restoration aimed at grounding Roman hegemony in this ancestral religious tradition of the Latins. The original cult was reinstated unchanged as is testified by some archaic features of the ritual:  the exclusion of wine from the sacrifice&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Divinatione''  I 18; Dionysius Hal.  AR IV 49, 3; Festus p. 212 L l. 30 f.; '' Scholiasta Bobiensis ad Ciceronis pro Plancio'' 23.&lt;/ref&gt; the offers of milk and cheese and the ritual use of rocking among the games. Rocking is one of the most ancient rites mimicking ascent to Heaven and is very widespread. At the ''Latiar'' the rocking took place on a tree and the winner was of course the one who had swung the highest. This rite was said to have been instituted by the Albans to commemorate the disappearance of king [[Latinus]], in the battle against [[Mezentius]] king of [[Caere]]: the rite symbolised a search for him both on earth and in heaven. The rocking as well as the customary drinking of milk was also considered to commemorate and ritually reinstate infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Festus s.v. oscillantes p. 194 M; C. A. Lobeck ''Aglaophamus sive de theologiae mysticae Graecorum causis libri tres'' Königsberg 1829 p. 585.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans in the last form of the rite brought the sacrificial ox from Rome and every participant was bestowed a portion of the meat, rite known as ''carnem petere''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Pro Plancio'' 23; Varro LL VI 25; Pliny NH III 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Other games were held in every participant borough. In Rome a race of chariots (''quadrigae'') was held starting from the Capitol: the winner drank a liquor made with absynth.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny XXVII 45.&lt;/ref&gt; This competition has been compared to the Vedic rite of the [[vajapeya]]: in it seventeen chariots run a phoney race which must be won by the king in order to allow him to drink a cup of ''madhu'', i. e. ''soma''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Alföldi ''Early Rome and the Latins'' Ann Arbor 1965 p. 33 n. 6 cited by O. de Cazanove above p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The feasting lasted for at least four days, possibly six according to [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Niebuhr]], one day for each of the six Latin and Alban ''decuriae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=109}}; L. Schmitz in ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' London 1875 s. v. Feriae p. 529: Niebuhr  ''History of Rome'' II p. 35 citing Livy V 42, Plutarch  ''Camillus'' 42.&lt;/ref&gt; According to different records 47 or 53 boroughs took part in the festival  (the listed names too differ in Pliny NH III 69 and Dionysius of Halicarnassus AR V 61). The ''Latiar'' became an important feature of Roman political life as they were ''[[feriae conceptivae]]'', i. e. their date varied each year: the consuls and the highest magistrates were required to attend shortly after the beginning of the administration, originally on the Ides of March: the Feriae usually took place in early April. They could not start campaigning before its end and if any part of the games had been neglected or performed unritually the ''Latiar'' had to be wholly repeated. The inscriptions from the imperial age record the festival back to the time of the [[decemvir]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=110}}. CIL 2011–2022; XIV 2236–2248.&lt;/ref&gt;
Wissowa remarks the inner linkage of the temple of the Mons Albanus with that of the Capitol apparent in the common association with the rite of the [[Roman triumph|triumph]]:{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=110}} since 231 BC some triumphing commanders had triumphed there first with the same legal features as in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Livy XLII 21, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious calendar==
{{See also|Roman calendar}}

=== Ides ===
The [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]] (the midpoint of the month, with a full moon) was sacred to Jupiter, because on that day heavenly light shone day and night.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=101}}, citing Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 15, 14 and 18, Iohannes Lydus ''De Mensibus'' III 7, Plutarch ''Quaestiones Romanae'' 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Some (or all) Ides were ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|Feriae]] Iovis'', sacred to Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Rome's surviving calendars provide only fragmentary evidence for the ''Feriae'' but [[Georg Wissowa|Wissowa]] believes that every Ide was sacred to him.&lt;/ref&gt; On the Ides, a white lamb (''ovis idulis'') was led along Rome's [[Via Sacra|Sacred Way]] to the [[Arx (Roman)|Capitoline Citadel]] and sacrificed to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=101}}, citing Varro LL V 47; Festus p. 290 Müller, Paulus p. 104; Ovid ''Fasti'' I 56 and 588; Macrobius ''Sat.'' I 15, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter's two ''[[Epulum Jovis|epula Iovis]]'' festivals fell on the Ides, as did his temple foundation rites as ''Optimus Maximus'', ''Victor'', ''Invictus'' and (possibly) ''Stator''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=101}}: the ''epula Iovis'' fell on 13 September and 13 November. The temple foundation and festival dates are 13 September for Jupiter Optimus Maximus, 13 April for Jupiter Victor, 13 June for Jupiter Invictus, and perhaps 13 January for Jupiter Stator''.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nundinae ===
The ''[[nundinae]]'' recurred every ninth day, dividing the calendar into a market cycle analogous to a week. Market days gave rural people ''([[pagus|pagi]])'' the opportunity to sell in town and to be informed of religious and political edicts, which were posted publicly for three days. According to tradition, these festival days were instituted by the king [[Servius Tullius]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassius and Rutilius apud Macrobius I 16, 33. Tuditanus claimed they were instituted by Romulus and T. Tatius I 16, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The high priestess of Jupiter ''([[Flamen Dialis#Flaminica Dialis|Flaminica Dialis]])'' sanctified the days by sacrificing a ram to Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius I 16, 30: "...flaminica Iovi arietem solet immolare"; Dumézil ARR above p. 163 and n. 42, citing A. Kirsopp Michels ''The Calendar of the Roman Republic'' 1967 pp. 84–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivals===
{{See also|Roman festivals}}
During the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], more [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|fixed holidays]] on the Roman calendar were devoted to Jupiter than to any other deity.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Viniculture and wine====
Festivals of [[viniculture]] and wine were devoted to Jupiter, since grapes were particularly susceptible to adverse weather.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa ''Religion und Kultus der Römer'' Munich 1912 pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil describes wine as a "kingly" drink with the power to inebriate and exhilarate, analogous to the Vedic [[Soma (deity)|Soma]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Roman festivals were connected with viniculture and wine.

The rustic ''[[Vinalia]] altera'' on August 19 asked for good weather for ripening the grapes before harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=101}}, citing Pliny ''NH'' XVIII 289: "This festival day was established for the placation (i. e. averting) of storms", "''Hunc diem festum tempestatibus leniendis institutum''".&lt;/ref&gt; When the grapes were ripe,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912}}, citing [[Pandects|Digest]] II 12, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; a sheep was sacrificed to Jupiter and the ''flamen Dialis'' cut the first of the grape harvest.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above Milan 1977 p. 173; {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Meditrinalia]] on October 11 marked the end of the grape harvest; the new wine was [[pressed (wine)|pressed]], tasted and mixed with old wine&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=101-102}}, citing Varro LL VI 21 ''Novum vetus vinum bibo, novo veteri morbo medeor''.&lt;/ref&gt; to control fermentation. In the ''Fasti Amiternini'', this festival is assigned to Jupiter. Later Roman sources invented a goddess ''Meditrina'', probably to explain the name of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil, ''Fêtes romaines d' été et d' automne'', Paris, 1975, pp. 97–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the ''[[Vinalia]] urbana'' on April 23, new wine was offered to Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;In Roman legend Aeneas vowed all of that year's wine of Latium to Jupiter before the battle with [[Mezentius]]: cf. G. Dumézil ARR above p. 173 ; Ovid ''Fasti'' IV 863 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of it were poured into a ditch near the temple of [[Venus Erycina]], which was located on the Capitol.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=102}}, citing Varro LL VI 16, Pliny NH XVIII 287, Ovid  ''Fasti'' IV 863 ff., Paulus p. 65 and 374 M.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regifugium and Poplifugium====
{{See also|Regifugium|Poplifugia}}
The ''[[Regifugium]]'' ("King's Flight")&lt;ref&gt;Gary Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War'' (University of California Press, 2005, 2006), p. 136. ''Populus'' originally meant not "the people," but "army."&lt;/ref&gt; on February 24 has often been discussed in connection with the ''[[Poplifugia]]'' on July 5, a day holy to Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Turcan, ''The Cults of the Roman Empire'' (Blackwell, 1992, 1996, 2001 printing, originally published 1989 in French), p. 75. Wissowa had already connected the ''Poplifugia'' to Jupiter: RK p. 102, citing [[Cassius Dio]] XLVII 18 and the ''Fasti Amiternini''  (''feriae Iovis'').&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Regifugium'' followed the festival of ''Iuppiter [[Terminus (mythology)|Terminus]]'' (Jupiter of Boundaries) on February 23. Later Roman [[antiquarian]]s misinterpreted the ''Regifugium'' as marking the expulsion of the monarchy, but the "king" of this festival may have been the priest known as the ''[[rex sacrorum]]'' who ritually enacted the waning and renewal of power associated with the [[New Year]] (March 1 in the old Roman calendar).&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; A temporary vacancy of power (construed as a yearly "[[interregnum]]") occurred between the ''Regifugium'' on February 24 and the New Year on March 1 (when the lunar cycle was thought to coincide again with the solar cycle), and the uncertainty and change during the two winter months were over.&lt;ref&gt;André Magdelain "Auspicia ad patres redeunt" in ''Hommage á Jean Bayet'' Bruxelles 1964 527 ff.

The ''Poplifugia'' ("Routing of Armies"&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome'', p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;), a day sacred to Jupiter, may similarly mark the second half of the year; before the [[Julian calendar|Julian calendar reform]], the months were named numerically, ''[[Quintilis]]'' (the fifth month) to ''December'' (the tenth month).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Gagé]] thinks the murder of [[Servius Tullius]] occurred on this date, as [[Tarquin the Proud]] and his wife Tullia would have taken advtange of the occasion to claim publicly that Servius has lost the favour of the gods (especially Fortuna): Jean Gagé "La mort de Servius Tullius et le char de Tullia" in ''Revue belge de philologie et d' histoire'' '''41''' 1963 1 pp. 25–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Poplifugia'' was a "primitive military ritual" for which the adult male population assembled for purification rites, after which they ritually dispelled foreign invaders from Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epula Iovis====
{{See also|Epulum Jovis}} 
There were two festivals called ''epulum Iovis'' ("Feast of Jove"). One was held on September 13, the anniversary of the foundation of Jupiter's Capitoline temple. The other (and probably older) festival was part of the [[Plebeian Games]] ''(Ludi Plebei)'', and was held on November 13.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Le Bonniec ''Le culte de Cérès á Rome'' Paris 1958 p. 348, developing Jean Bayet ''Les annales de Tite Live'' (Titus Livius ''AUC libri qui supersunt'') ed. G. Budé vol. III Paris 1942 Appendix V pp. 145–153.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century BC, the ''epulum Iovis'' became similar to a [[lectisternium]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 485–486.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ludi====
{{See also|Ludi}}
The most ancient Roman games followed after one day (considered a ''dies ater'', or "black day", i. e. a day which was traditionally considered unfortunate even though it was not ''nefas'', see also article [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion]]) the two ''Epula Iovis'' of September and November.

The games of September were named ''Ludi Magni''; originally they were not held every year, but later became the annual ''Ludi Romani''&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen ''Römischen Forschungen'' II p. 42 ff. puts their founding on 366 BC at the establishment of the curule aedility. Cited by {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and were held in the [[Circus Maximus]] after a procession from the Capitol. The games were attributed to Tarquinius Priscus,&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 35, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and linked to the cult of Jupiter on the Capitol. Romans themselves acknowledged analogies with the [[Roman triumph|triumph]], which Dumézil thinks can be explained by their common Etruscan origin; the magistrate in charge of the games dressed as the ''triumphator'' and the ''[[pompa circensis]]'' resembled a triumphal procession. Wissowa and Mommsen argue that they were a detached part of the triumph on the above grounds&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=111–112}}, citing Livy V 41, 2 ; Tertullian ''De corona militis'' 13; Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Antiq. Rom.'' VII 72. Marquardt ''Staatsverwaltung'' III 508.&lt;/ref&gt; (a conclusion which Dumézil rejects).&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ludi Plebei'' took place in November in the [[Circus Flaminius]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 181 citing Jean Bayet ''Les annales de Tite Live'' édition G. Budé vol. III 1942 Appendix V p. 153 and n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] argued that the ''epulum'' of the Ludi Plebei was the model of the Ludi Romani, but Wissowa finds the evidence for this assumption insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=112}}, citing Mommsen CIL I 2nd p. 329, 335; ''Rǒmische Forschungen'' II 45, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ludi Plebei'' were probably established in 534 BC. Their association with the cult of Jupiter is attested by Cicero.&lt;ref&gt;''In Verrem'' V 36 and Paulus s.v. ''ludi magni'' p.&amp;nbsp;122 M.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Larentalia====
The ''feriae'' of December 23 were devoted to a major ceremony in honour of [[Acca Larentia]] (or ''Larentina''), in which some of the highest religious authorities participated (probably including the [[Flamen Quirinalis]] and the [[pontiff]]s). The [[Fasti Praenestini]] marks the day as ''feriae Iovis'', as does Macrobius.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius I 10, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether the rite of ''parentatio'' was itself the reason for the festival of Jupiter, or if this was another festival which happened to fall on the same day. Wissowa denies their association, since Jupiter and his ''flamen'' would not be involved with the [[Roman mythology|underworld]] or the deities of death (or be present at a funeral rite held at a gravesite).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=102}}, citing Gellius X 15, 12. 24; Paulus p. 87 M.; Pliny NH XVIII 119; Plutarch ''Quaest. Romanae'' 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin name ''Iuppiter'' originated as a [[Vocative case|vocative compound]] of the [[Old Latin]] vocative *''Iou'' and ''pater'' ("father") and came to replace the Old Latin [[nominative case]] *''Ious''. Jove&lt;ref&gt;Most common in [[poetry]], for its useful [[Poetry#Meter|meter]], and in the expression "By Jove!"&lt;/ref&gt; is a less common [[English (language)|English]] formation based on ''Iov-'', the stem of oblique cases of the Latin name. [[Linguistics|Linguistic]] studies identify the form *''Iou-pater'' as deriving from the [[Proto-Italic language|Proto-Italic]] vocable *''Djous Patēr'',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and ultimately the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] vocative compound *''Dyēu-pəter'' (meaning "O Father Sky-god"; nominative: *''[[Dyeus|Dyēus]]-pətēr'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/8.html |title=Indo-European and the Indo-Europeans |access-date=2008-09-27 |work=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=4th |year=2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301052033/http://www.bartleby.com/61/8.html |archive-date=2009-03-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older forms of the deity's name in Rome were ''Dieus-pater'' ("day/sky-father"), then ''Diéspiter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=100}}, citing Varro LL V 66: "The same peculiarity is revealed even better by the ancient name of Jupiter: since once he was named ''Diovis'' and  '' Diespiter'', that is ''Dies Pater'' (Day Father); consequently the beings issued from him are named ''dei'' (gods), ''dius''  (god), ''diuum'' (day)  hence the expressions ''sub diuo'' and '' Dius Fidius''. This is why the temple of ''Dius Fidius'' has an opening in the roof, in order to allow the view of the ''diuum'' i. e.  the ''caelum'' sky" tr. by J. Collart quoted by Y. Lehmann below; Paulus p. 71:"''dium'' (the divinised sky), who denotes what is in the open air, outside the roof derives from the name of ''Iupiter'', as well as ''Dialis'', epithet of the flamen of Jupiter and ''dius'' that is applied to a hero descended from the race of Jupiter" and 87 M.&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century philologist [[Georg Wissowa]] asserted these names are conceptually- and linguistically-connected to ''Diovis'' and ''Diovis Pater''; he compares the analogous formations ''Vedius''-''Veiove'' and ''fulgur Dium'', as opposed to ''fulgur Summanum'' (nocturnal lightning bolt) and ''flamen Dialis'' (based on ''Dius'', ''dies'').{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=100}} The Ancient later viewed them as entities separate from Jupiter. The terms are similar in etymology and semantics (''dies'', "daylight" and ''Dius'', "daytime sky"), but differ linguistically. Wissowa considers the epithet ''Dianus'' noteworthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=100}}, n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CIL V 783: ''Iovi Diano'' from Aquileia.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dieus'' is the etymological equivalent of [[ancient Greece]]'s ''[[Zeus]]'' and of the [[Germanic peoples|Teutonics']] ''[[Ziu]]'' (genitive ''Ziewes''). The Indo-European deity is the god from which the names and partially the theology of Jupiter, Zeus and the [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] [[Vedic mythology|Vedic]] [[Dyaus Pita]] derive or have developed.&lt;ref&gt;H. F. Müller in ''The Oxford Encyclopaedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' s.v. Jupiter p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman practice of swearing by Jove to witness an oath in law courts&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Jupiter_Feretrius.html Samuel Ball Platner, revised by Thomas Ashby: ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'', London: Oxford University Press, 1929 p. 293] and ''Der Große Brockhaus'', vol. 9, Leipzig: Brockhaus 1931, p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; is the origin of the expression "by Jove!"—archaic, but still in use. The name of the god was also adopted as the name of the planet [[Jupiter]]; the [[adjective]] "[[wikt:jovial|jovial]]" originally described those born under the planet of [[Jupiter]]&lt;ref&gt;Walter W.

Jove was the original namesake of Latin forms of the [[Week-day names|weekday]] now known in English as [[Thursday#Origins of the name|Thursday]]&lt;ref&gt;English ''Thursday'', German ''Donnerstag'', is named after [[Thunor]], [[Thor]], or [[Old High German]] [[Donar]] from [[Germanic paganism|Germanic mythology]], a deity similar to [[Jupiter Tonans]]&lt;/ref&gt; (originally called ''Iovis Dies'' in [[Latin language|Latin]]). These became ''jeudi'' in [[French language|French]], ''jueves'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''joi'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], ''giovedì'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], ''dijous'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], ''Xoves'' in [[Galician language|Galician]], ''Joibe'' in [[Friulian language|Friulian]] and ''Dijóu'' in [[Franco-Provençal language|Provençal]].

===Major epithets===
{{Main|Epithets of Jupiter}}
The epithets of a Roman god indicate his theological qualities. The study of these epithets must consider their origins (the historical context of an epithet's source).

Jupiter's most ancient attested forms of cult belong to the State cult: these include the mount cult (see section above note n. 22&lt;!-- a less easily broken reference here could use an anchor --&gt;).  In Rome this cult entailed the existence of particular sanctuaries the most important of which were located on ''Mons Capitolinus'' (earlier ''Tarpeius''). The mount had two tops that were both destined to the discharge of acts of cult related to Jupiter. The northern and higher top was the ''[[Arx (Roman)|arx]]'' and on it was located the observation place of the [[augurs]] ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#auguraculum|auguraculum]])'' and to it headed the monthly procession of the ''sacra Idulia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=108}}, citing Varro LL V 47 and Festus p. 290 M. s.v. Idulia.&lt;/ref&gt; On the southern top was to be found the [[Temple of Jupiter Feretrius|most ancient sanctuary]] of the god: the shrine of ''Iuppiter Feretrius'' allegedly built by Romulus, restored by Augustus. The god here had no image and was represented by the sacred flintstone (''silex'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=108}}, citing Paulus p. 92 M.; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' VIII 641.&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient known rites, those of the ''spolia opima'' and of the [[fetials]] which connect Jupiter with Mars and Quirinus are dedicated to ''Iuppiter Feretrius'' or ''Iuppiter Lapis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=108}}, citing Festus p. 189 M. s.v. lapis; Polybius ''Historiae'' III 25, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the sky god was already overlapped with the ethical and political domain since this early time. According to Wissowa and Dumézil&lt;ref name="G. Dumézil ARR above p. 169"&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iuppiter Lapis'' seems to be inseparable from ''Iuppiter Feretrius'', in whose tiny temple on the Capitol the stone was lodged.
 
Another most ancient epithet is ''Lucetius'': although the Ancients, followed by some modern scholars such as Wissowa,{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=100}} interpreted it as referring to sunlight, the ''carmen Saliare'' shows that it refers to lightning.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ARR above p. 167. The ''carmen Saliare'' has: "cume tonas Leucesie prai ted tremonti/ quot tibi etinei deis cum tonarem".&lt;/ref&gt; A further confirmation of this interpretation is provided by the sacred meaning of lightning which is reflected in the sensitivity of the ''flaminica Dialis'' to the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt; To the same atmospheric complex belongs the epithet ''Elicius'': while the ancient erudites thought it was connected to lightning, it is in fact related to the opening of the rervoirs of rain, as is testified by the ceremony of the ''Nudipedalia'', meant to propitiate rainfall and devoted to Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 168 citing [[Petronius]] ''[[Satyricon]]'' 44.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ritual of the ''[[lapis manalis]]'', the stone which was brought into the city through the ''Porta Capena'' and carried around in times of drought, which was named ''Aquaelicium''.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus s. v. p. 94 L 2nd; p. 2 M; Tertullian ''Apologeticum'' 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Other early epithets connected with the atmospheric quality of Jupiter are ''Pluvius'', ''Imbricius'', ''Tempestas'', ''Tonitrualis'', ''tempestatium divinarum potens'', ''Serenator'', ''Serenus''&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius ''De Mundo'' 37; cf. ''Iuppiter Serenus'' CIL VI 431, 433,; XI 6312;  ''Iuppiter Pluvialis'' CIL XI 324.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Iuppiter Serenus'' has been recognized as an ''interpretatio'' of the Phocean god Ζευς Ούριος: F. Cenerini above p. 104 citing Giancarlo Susini "Iuppiter Serenus e altri dei" in ''Epigraphica'' '''33''' 1971 pp. 175–177.&lt;/ref&gt; and, referred to lightning, ''Fulgur'',&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius I 2, 5; CIL I 2nd p. 331: sanctuary in the Campus Martius, dedicated on October 7 according to calendaries.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fulgur Fulmen'',&lt;ref&gt;CIL XII 1807.&lt;/ref&gt; later as nomen agentis  ''Fulgurator'', ''Fulminator'':&lt;ref&gt;CIL VI 377; III 821, 1596, 1677, 3593, 3594, 6342 cited by {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the high antiquity of the cult is testified by the neutre form ''Fulgur'' and the use of the term for the ''bidental'', the lightning well dug on the spot hit by a lightning bolt.&lt;ref&gt;Festus s. v. provorsum fulgur p. 229 M: "...; itaque Iovi Fulguri et Summano fit, quod diurna Iovis nocturna Summani fulgura habentur." as cited by {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jupiter bronze Luxembourg MNHA.jpg|thumb|A bronze statue of Jupiter, from the territory of the [[Treveri]]]]
A group of epithets has been interpreted by Wissowa (and his followers) as a reflection of the agricultural or warring nature of the god, some of which are also in the list of eleven preserved by Augustine.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine ''De Civitate Dei'' (herafter CD) VII 11. ''Pecunia'' is tentatively included in this group by {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=105}} n.  4. Cfr. Augustine CD VII 11 end and 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Frugifer'' CIL XII 336. Apuleius ''De Mundo'' 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The agricultural ones include ''Opitulus'', ''Almus'', ''Ruminus'', ''Frugifer'', ''Farreus'', ''Pecunia'', ''Dapalis'',&lt;ref&gt;Cato ''De Agri Cultura'' 132; Paulus s. v. p. 51 M.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Epulo''.&lt;ref&gt;CIL VI 3696.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine gives an explanation of the ones he lists which should reflect Varro's: ''Opitulus'' because he brings ''opem'' (means, relief) to the needy, ''Almus'' because he nourishes everything, ''Ruminus'' because he nourishes the living beings by breastfeeding them, ''Pecunia'' because everything belongs to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=105}} n. 4 understands ''Pecunia'' as protector and increaser of the flock.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dumézil maintains the cult usage of these epithets is not documented and that the epithet Ruminus, as Wissowa and Latte remarked, may not have the meaning given by Augustine but it should be understood as part of a series including  ''Rumina'', '' Ruminalis ficus'', ''Iuppiter Ruminus'', which bears the name of Rome itself with an Etruscan vocalism preserved in inscriptions, series that would be preserved in the sacred language (cf. ''Rumach'' Etruscan for Roman). However many scholars have argued that the name of Rome, ''Ruma'', meant in fact woman's breast.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Migliorini s.v. Roma in ''Enciclopedia Italiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti'' vol. XXIX p. 589; A. W. Schlegel ''Sämtliche Werke'' Leipzig 1847 XII p. 488; F. Kort ''Römische Geschichte'' Heidelberg 1843 p.32-3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diva Rumina]], as Augustine testifies in the cited passage, was the goddess of suckling babies: she was venerated near the ''ficus ruminalis'' and was offered only libations of milk.&lt;ref&gt;N. G. L. Hammond &amp; H. H. Scullard (Eds.) ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'' Oxford 1970 s. v. p. 940.&lt;/ref&gt; Here moreover Augustine cites the verses devoted to Jupiter by [[Quintus Valerius Soranus]], while hypothesising ''Iuno'' (more adept in his view as a breastfeeder), i.e. Rumina instead of Ruminus, might be nothing else than  ''Iuppiter'': "''Iuppiter omnipotens regum rerumque deumque Progenitor genetrixque deum...''".

In Dumézil's opinion ''Farreus'' should be understood as related to the rite of the ''confarreatio'' the most sacred form of marriage, the name of which is due to the spelt cake eaten by the spouses, rather than surmising an agricultural quality of the god: the epithet means the god was the guarantor of the effects of the ceremony, to which the presence of his flamen is necessary and that he can interrupt with a clap of thunder.&lt;ref&gt;Servius IV 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

The epithet ''Dapalis'' is on the other hand connected to a rite described by Cato and mentioned by Festus.&lt;ref&gt;Cato ''De Agri Cultura'' 132; Festus s. v. daps, dapalis, dapaticum pp. 177–178 L 2nd.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the sowing of autumn or spring the peasant offered a banquet of roast beef and a cup of wine to Jupiter : it is natural that on such occasions he would entreat the god who has power over the weather, however Cato' s prayer of s one of sheer offer and no request. The language suggests another attitude: Jupiter is invited to a banquet which is supposedly abundant and magnificent. The god is honoured as ''summus''. The peasant may hope he shall receive a benefit, but he does not say it. This interpretation finds support in the analogous urban ceremony of the ''epulum Iovis'', from which the god derives the epithet of  ''Epulo''  and which was a magnificent feast accompanied by flutes.&lt;ref&gt;''Epulo'' CIL VI 3696.&lt;/ref&gt;

Epithets related to warring are in Wissowa's view  ''Iuppiter Feretrius'', ''Iuppiter Stator'', ''Iuppiter Victor'' and ''Iuppiter Invictus''.{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|pages=105-108}} ''Feretrius'' would be connected with war by the rite of the first type of  ''[[spolia opima]]'' which is in fact a dedication to the god of the arms of the defeated king of the enemy that happens whenever he has been killed by the king of Rome or his equivalent authority. Here too Dumézil notes the dedication has to do with regality and not with war, since the rite is in fact the offer of the arms of a king by a king:  a proof of such an assumption is provided by the fact that the arms of an enemy king captured by an officer or a common soldier were dedicated to Mars and Quirinus respectively.

''Iuppiter Stator'' was first attributed by tradition to [[Romulus]], who had prayed to the god for his almighty help at a difficult time during the battle with the Sabines of king Titus Tatius.&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 12, 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil opines the action of Jupiter is not that of a god of war who wins through fighting: Jupiter acts by causing an inexplicable change in the morale of the fighters of the two sides. The same feature can be detected also in the certainly historical record of the battle of the third Samnite War in 294 BC, in which consul [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] vowed a temple to ''Iuppiter Stator'' if "Jupiter will stop the rout of the Roman army and if afterwards the Samnite legions shall be victouriously massacred...It looked as if the gods themselves had taken side with Romans, so much easily did the Roman arms succeed in prevailing...".&lt;ref&gt;Livy X 36, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil above pp. 174–75.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar manner one can explain the epithet ''Victor'', whose cult was founded in 295 BC on the battlefield of [[Sentinum]] by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges (consul 292 BC)|Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges]] and who received another vow again in 293 by consul [[Lucius Papirius Cursor]] before a battle against the Samnite ''legio linteata''. The religious meaning of the vow is in both cases an appeal to the supreme god by a Roman chief at a time of need for divine help from the supreme god, albeit for different reasons: Fabius had remained the only political and military responsible of the Roman State after the ''devotio'' of P. Decius Mus, Papirius had to face an enemy who had acted with impious rites and vows, i.e. was religiously reprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;Livy X 29, 12–17; ''nefando sacro, mixta hominum pecudumque caedes'', "by an impious rite, a mixed slaughter of people and flock" 39, 16; 42, 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently Dario Sabbatucci has given a different interpretation of the meaning of ''Stator'' within the frame of his structuralistic and dialectic vision of Roman calendar, identifying oppositions, tensions and equilibria: January is the month of [[Janus]], at the beginning of the year, in the uncertain time of winter (the most ancient calendar had only ten months, from March to December). In this month Janus deifies kingship and defies Jupiter. Moreover, January sees also the presence of [[Veiovis]] who appears as an anti-Jupiter, of [[Carmenta]] who is the goddess of birth and like Janus has two opposed faces, ''Prorsa'' and ''Postvorta'' (also named [[Antevorta]] and [[Antevorta|Porrima]]), of [[Iuturna]], who as a gushing spring evokes the process of coming into being from non-being as the god of passage and change does. In this period the preeminence of Janus needs compensating on the Ides through the action of Jupiter ''Stator'', who plays the role of anti-Janus, i.e. of moderator of the action of Janus.&lt;ref&gt;Dario Sabbatucci above, as summarized in the review by Robert Turcan above p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feretrius was called upon to witness solemn oaths.&lt;ref&gt;''Der Große Brockhaus'', vol.9, Leipzig: Brockhaus 1931, p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet or "[[numen]]" is probably connected with the verb ''ferire'', "to strike," referring to a ritual striking of ritual as illustrated in ''foedus ferire'', of which the ''silex'', a quartz rock, is evidence in his temple on the Capitoline hill, which is said to have been the first temple in Rome, erected and dedicated by [[Romulus]] to commemorate his winning of the ''spolia opima'' from Acron, king of the Caeninenses, and to serve as a repository for them. ''Iuppiter Feretrius'' was therefore equivalent to ''Iuppiter Lapis'', the latter used for a specially solemn oath.&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Jupiter_Feretrius.html Samuel Ball Platner, revised by Thomas Ashby: ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'', London: Oxford University Press, 1929 p.293]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Livy I 10, 5 and Plutarch ''Marcellus'' 8 though, the meaning of this epithet is related to the peculiar frame used to carry the ''spolia opima'' to the god, the ''feretrum'', itself from verb ''fero'',

Dumézil above p. It. tr. Milan 1977 p.168.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syncretic or geographical epithets====
Some epithets of Jupiter indicate his association with a particular place. Epithets found in the provinces of the Roman Empire may identify Jupiter with a local deity or site (see [[syncretism]]).
*'''Jupiter Ammon''', Jupiter equated with the Egyptian deity [[Amun]] after the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman conquest of Egypt]]
*'''Jupiter Brixianus''', Jupiter equated with the local god of the town of [[Brescia]] in [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (modern North [[Italy]])
*'''Jupiter Capitolinus''', also Jupiter Optimus Maximus, venerated throughout the [[Roman Empire]] at sites with a ''Capitol'' ([[Capitolium]])
*'''[[Jupiter Dolichenus]]''', from [[Gaziantep|Doliche]] in [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], originally a [[Baal]] weather and war god. From the time of [[Vespasian]], he was popular among the [[Roman legions]] as god of war and victory, especially on the [[Danube]] at [[Carnuntum]]. He is depicted as standing on a bull, with a thunderbolt in his left hand, and a double ax in the right.
*'''[[Jupiter Indiges]]''', "Jupiter of the country," a title given to [[Aeneas]] after his death, according to [[Livy]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], [[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]] Book 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Jupiter Ladicus''', Jupiter equated with a Celtiberian mountain-god and worshipped as the spirit of Mount Ladicus in [[Gallaecia]], northwest Iberia,&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' II, 2525; Toutain. 1920. 143ff.&lt;/ref&gt; preserved in the toponym ''Codos de Ladoco''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Dictionary'', ''s.v.'' "Ladicus")&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Jupiter Laterius''' or '''Latiaris''', the god of [[Latium]]
*'''Jupiter Parthinus''' or '''Partinus''', under this name was worshiped on the borders of northeast [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and [[Upper Moesia]], perhaps associated with the local tribe known as the [[Partheni]].
*'''Jupiter Poeninus''', under this name worshipped in the Alps, around the [[Great St Bernard Pass]], where he had a sanctuary.
*'''Jupiter Solutorius''', a local version of Jupiter worshipped in [[Spain]]; he was syncretised with the local [[Iberians|Iberian]] god [[Eacus (god)|Eacus]].
*'''Jupiter Taranis''', Jupiter equated with the Celtic god [[Taranis]].
*'''Jupiter Uxellinus''', Jupiter as a god of high mountains.&lt;!--isn't this a Gaulish epithet, as in Uxellodunum--&gt;

In addition, many of the epithets of Zeus can be found applied to Jupiter, by ''[[interpretatio romana]]''. Thus, since the hero [[Trophonius]] (from [[Lebadea]] in Boeotia) is called Zeus Trophonius, this can be represented in English (as it would be in Latin) as Jupiter Trophonius. Similarly, the Greek cult of Zeus [[Meilichios]] appears in Pompeii as Jupiter Meilichius. Except in representing actual cults in Italy, this is largely 19th-century usage; modern works distinguish Jupiter from Zeus.

==Theology==

===Sources===
[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] and [[Verrius Flaccus]]&lt;ref&gt;The work of Verrius Flaccus is preserved through the summary of [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]] and his epitomist [[Paul the Deacon]].&lt;/ref&gt; were the main sources on the theology of Jupiter and archaic Roman religion in general. Varro was acquainted with the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#libri pontificales|libri pontificum]]'' ("books of the [[College of Pontiffs|Pontiffs]]") and their archaic classifications.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Dumézil ''La religion romaine archaïque'', Payot, Paris, 1974 2nd "Remarques preliminaires" X; It. tr. Milan 1977 p. 59ff.; citing Lucien Gerschel "Varron logicien" in ''Latomus'' '''17''' 1958 pp. 65–72.&lt;/ref&gt; On these two sources depend other ancient authorities, such as [[Ovid]], [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], [[Aulus Gellius]], [[Macrobius]], [[Church Fathers|patristic texts]], [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] and [[Plutarch]].

One of the most important sources which preserve the theology of Jupiter and other [[List of Roman deities|Roman deities]] is ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God against the Pagans]]'' by [[Augustine of Hippo]]. Augustine's criticism of traditional Roman religion is based on Varro's lost work, ''[[Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum|Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum]]''. Although a work of [[Christian apologetics]], ''The City of God'' provides glimpses into Varro's theological system and authentic Roman theological lore in general. According to Augustine,&lt;ref&gt;Augustine ''De Civitate Dei'' IV 27; VI 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Varro drew on the pontiff [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex|Mucius Scaevola]]'s tripartite theology:

* The [[mythical theology|mythic theology]] of the poets (useful for the [[Theatre of ancient Rome|theatre]])
* The [[Natural theology|physical theology]] of the philosophers (useful for understanding the natural world)
* The civil theology of the priests (useful for the state)&lt;ref&gt;J. Pépin "La théologie tripartite de Varron" ''Revue des études augustiniennes'' '''2''' 1956 pp. 265-294. Dumézil has pointed out that even though Augustine may be correct in pointing out cases in which Varro presented under the civil theology category contents that may look to belong to mythic theology, nevertheless he preserved under this heading the lore and legends ancient Romans considered their own.&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Theology of Jupiter in early Rome}}Jovian theology===
[[Georg Wissowa]] stressed Jupiter's uniqueness as the only case among Indo-European religions in which the original god preserved his name, his identity and his prerogatives.{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=100}} In this view, Jupiter is the god of heaven and retains his identification with the sky among the Latin poets (his name is used as a synonym for "sky".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912}} cites three passages from Horace, ''Carmina'': I 1, 25 ''manet sub Iove frigido venator''; I 22, 20 ''quod latus mundi nebulae malusque Iuppiter urget''; III 10, 7 ''ut glaciet nives puro numine Iuppiter''.&lt;/ref&gt;) In this respect, he differs from his Greek equivalent Zeus (who is considered a personal god, warden and dispenser of skylight). His name reflects this idea; it is a derivative of the Indo-European word for "bright, shining sky". His residence is found atop the hills of Rome and of mountains in general; as a result, his cult is present in Rome and throughout Italy at upper elevations.&lt;ref&gt;On the Esquiline lies the ''sacellum'' of  ''Iuppiter Fagutalis'' (Varro ''De Lingua Latina'' V 152 (hereafter LL), Paulus p. 87 M., Pliny ''Naturalis historia'' XVI 37 (hereafter NH), CIL VI 452); on the Viminal is known a ''Iuppiter Viminius'' (Varro LL V 51, Festus p. 376); a ''Iuppiter Caelius'' on the Caelius (CIL VI 334); on the Quirinal the so called ''Capitolium Vetus'' (Martial V 22, 4; VII 73, 4). Outside Rome: Iuppiter Latiaris on ''Mons Albanus'', [[Temple of Jupiter Apenninus|Iuppiter Appenninus]] (Orelli 1220, CIL VIII 7961 and XI 5803) on the Umbrian Appennines, at Scheggia, on the [[Via Flaminia]], Iuppiter Poeninus (CIL 6865 ff., cfr. Bernabei ''Rendiconti della Regia Accademia dei Lincei'' '''III''', 1887, fascicolo 2, p. 363 ff.) at Great Saint Bernard Pass, Iuppiter Vesuvius (CIL X 3806), Iuppiter Ciminus (CIL XI 2688); the Sabine Iuppiter Cacunus (CIL IX 4876, VI 371). Outside Italy Iuppiter Culminalis in Noricum and Pannonia (CIL III 3328, 4032, 4115, 5186; Supplememtum 10303, 11673 etc.) as cited by {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=102}} and Francesca Cenerini "Scritture di santuari extraurbani tra le Alpi e gli Appennini" in ''[[Mélanges de l'École française de Rome]]'' (hereafter ''MEFRA'')  '''104''' 1992 1 pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter assumed atmospheric qualities; he is the wielder of lightning and the master of weather. However, Wissowa acknowledges that Jupiter is not merely a naturalistic, heavenly, supreme deity; he is in continual communication with man by means of thunder, lightning and the flight of birds (his [[auspices]]). Through his vigilant watch he is also the guardian of public oaths and compacts and the guarantor of good faith in the State cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=100-101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jovian cult was common to the [[Italic people]] under the names ''Iove'', ''Diove'' (Latin) and  ''Iuve'', ''Diuve'' (Oscan, in Umbrian only ''Iuve'', ''Iupater'' in the [[Iguvine Tables]]).

Wissowa considered Jupiter also a god of war and agriculture, in addition to his political role as guarantor of good faith (public and private) as ''Iuppiter Lapis'' and ''Dius Fidius'', respectively. His view is grounded in the sphere of action of the god (who intervenes in battle and influences the harvest through weather).{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=103–108}}
 
In [[Georges Dumézil]]'s view, Jovian theology (and that of the equivalent gods in other Indo-European religions) is an evolution from a naturalistic, supreme, celestial god identified with heaven to a sovereign god, a wielder of lightning bolts, master and protector of the community (in other words, of a change from a naturalistic approach to the world of the divine to a socio-political approach).&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil above It. tr. pp. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Giorgione, The tempest.jpg|thumb|One interpretation of the lightning in [[Giorgione]]'s ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|Tempest]]'' is that it represents the presence of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Salvatore Settis, ''Giorgione's ''Tempest'': Interpreting the Hidden Subject'', University of Chicago Press, 1990, p. 62, summarising this scholarly interpretation: "The lightning is Jove." cf Peter Humfrey, ''Painting in Renaissance Venice'', Yale University Press, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ARLTK284AHAC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=Giorgione+tempest+jupiter&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cSp_TpupGYTo0QGe2tz-Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Giorgione%20tempest%20jupiter&amp;f=false p.118f.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424065939/https://books.google.com/books?id=ARLTK284AHAC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=Giorgione+tempest+jupiter&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cSp_TpupGYTo0QGe2tz-Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Giorgione%20tempest%20jupiter&amp;f=false |date=2016-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=Painting of a mother feeding her child, watched by a shepherd, with lightning flashing across a dark sky in the background]]

In [[Vedic mythology|Vedic religion]], [[Dyaus Pitar]] remained confined to his distant, removed, passive role and the place of sovereign god was occupied by [[Varuna]] and [[Mitra]]. In Greek and Roman religion, instead, the homonymous gods ''*Diou-'' and ''Δι[[digamma|ϝ]]-'' evolved into atmospheric deities; by their mastery of thunder and lightning, they expressed themselves and made their will known to the community. In Rome, Jupiter also sent signs to the leaders of the state in the form of [[auspices]] in addition to thunder. The art of [[augury]] was considered prestigious by ancient Romans; by sending his signs, Jupiter (the sovereign of heaven) communicates his advice to his terrestrial colleague: the king (''rex'') or his successor magistrates. The encounter between the heavenly and political, legal aspects of the deity are well represented by the prerogatives, privileges, functions and taboos proper to his ''[[flamen]]'' (the ''[[flamen Dialis]]'' and his wife, the ''flaminica Dialis'').

Dumézil maintains that Jupiter is not himself a god of war and agriculture, although his actions and interest may extend to these spheres of human endeavour. His view is based on the methodological assumption that the chief criterion for studying a god's nature is not to consider his field of action, but the quality, method and features of his action. Consequently, the analysis of the type of action performed by Jupiter in the domains in which he operates indicates that Jupiter is a sovereign god who may act in the field of politics (as well as agriculture and war) in his capacity as such, i.e. in a way and with the features proper to a king. Sovereignty is expressed through the two aspects of absolute, magic power (epitomised and represented by the Vedic god [[Varuna]]) and lawful right (by the Vedic god [[Mitra]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil above p. 239; It. Tr. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; However, sovereignty permits action in every field; otherwise, it would lose its essential quality. As a further proof, Dumézil cites the story of Tullus Hostilius (the most belligerent of the Roman kings), who was killed by Jupiter with a lightning bolt (indicating that he did not enjoy the god's favour). 
Varro's definition of Jupiter as the god who has under his jurisdiction the full expression of every being (''penes Iovem sunt summa'') reflects the sovereign nature of the god, as opposed to the jurisdiction of Janus (god of passages and change) on their beginning (''penes Ianum sunt prima'').&lt;ref&gt;Varro apud Augustine ''De Civitate Dei VII 9.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other gods==

===Capitoline Triad===
{{See also|Capitoline Triad}}
[[File:Arte romana, triade capitolina, 160-180 dc (guidonia montecelio, museo civico archeologico) 01.jpg|thumb|Capitoline Triad|alt=Statue of three figures, seated side by side]]
The Capitoline Triad was introduced to Rome by the Tarquins. Dumézil&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 274 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; thinks it might have been an Etruscan (or local) creation based on Vitruvius' treatise on architecture, in which the three deities are associated as the most important. It is possible that the Etruscans paid particular attention to [[Menrva]] (Minerva) as a goddess of destiny, in addition to the royal couple Uni (Juno) and Tinia (Jupiter).&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil ARR above p. 271 citing Ovid ''Fasti'' III 815–832.&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, Minerva later assumed a military aspect under the influence of [[Athena Pallas]] (Polias). Dumézil argues that with the advent of the Republic, Jupiter became the only king of Rome, no longer merely the first of the great gods.

====Archaic Triad====
{{Main|Archaic Triad}}
The Archaic Triad is a hypothetical theological structure (or system) consisting of the gods Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus. It was first described by Wissowa,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=23, 133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the concept was developed further by Dumézil.&lt;ref name="Dumézil-1941–1948-JuMaQu"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Georges Dumézil|Dumézil, G.]] |year=1941–1948 |title=Jupiter Mars Quirinus |volume=I-IV |place=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dumézil-1966-1970-ARR-I&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Georges Dumézil|Dumézil, G.]] |orig-date=1966 |title=Archaic Roman Religion |volume=I |pages=137–165, 172, 175 |year=1970 |lang=en |publisher=U.

At least for the three main functions, people in each station in life had their religious counterparts the divine figures of the sovereign god, the warrior god, and the industrius god; there were almost always two separate gods for class&amp;nbsp;1, and sometimes more than one for class&amp;nbsp;3. Over time gods or, groups of gods might be consolidated or split, and it is unclear that there were ever any strict separations of all function.

The sovereign function&amp;nbsp;(1) embodied in Jupiter entailed omnipotence; thence, a domain extended over every aspect of nature and life.{{efn|The colour relating to the sovereign function is white. The war function's color is red, and the production / farming function's color is black.&lt;ref name=Dumézil-1966-1970-ARR-I/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dumézil-1948-MitrVaru/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dumézil-1941–1948-JuMaQu"/&gt;}}

The three functions are interrelated with one another, overlapping to some extent; the sovereign function, although including a part that is essentially religious in nature, is involved in many ways in areas pertaining to the other two. Therefore, Jupiter is the "magic player" in the founding of the Roman state and the fields of war, agricultural plenty, human fertility, and wealth.&lt;ref name=Dumézil-1966-1970-ARR-I/&gt;{{rp|pages=172, 175}}

This hypothesis has not found widespread support among scholars.

===Jupiter and Minerva===
Apart from being protectress of the arts and craft as Minerva Capta, who was brought from Falerii, Minerva's association to Jupiter and relevance to Roman state religion is mainly linked to the [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|Palladium]], a wooden statue of Athena that could move the eyes and wave the spear. It was stored in the ''penus interior'', inner penus of the ''aedes Vestae'', temple of Vesta and considered the most important among the ''[[pignora imperii]]'', pawns of dominion, empire.&lt;ref&gt;E. Montanari ''Mito e Storia nell' annalistica romana delle origini'' Roma 1990 pp. 73 ff.; citing Cicero ''Pro Scauro 48: "''pignus nostrae salutis atque imperii''"; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem II 188, 16: "''Illic imperium fore ubi et Palladium''"; Festus s.v. p. 152 L.&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman traditional lore it was brought from Troy by Aeneas.  Scholars though think it was last taken to Rome in the third or second century BC.&lt;ref&gt;E. Montanari above citing M. Sordi "Lavinio, Roma e il Palladio" in ''CISA'' '''8''' 1982 p. 74 ff.; W. Vollgraf "Le Palladium de Rome" in ''BAB'' 1938 pp. 34 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juno and Fortuna===

The divine couple received from Greece its matrimonial implications, thence bestowing on [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] the role of tutelary goddess of marriage (''Iuno Pronuba'').

The couple itself though cannot be reduced to a Greek apport. The association of Juno and Jupiter is of the most ancient Latin theology.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil "Déesses latines et mythes vediques. III Fortuna Primigenia" in ''Coll. Latomus'' '''25''' 1956 pp. 71–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Praeneste]] offers a glimpse into original Latin mythology: the local goddess [[Fortuna]] is represented as milking two infants, one male and one female, namely Jove (Jupiter) and Juno.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De nat. Deor.'' II 85-86: "Is est locus saeptus religiose propter Iovis pueri, qui lactens cum Iunone in gremio sedens, mamma appetens, castissime colitur a matribus": "This is an enclosed place for religious reasons because of Iupiter child, who is seated on the womb with Juno suckling, directed towards the breast, very chastely worshipped by mothers".&lt;/ref&gt; It seems fairly safe to assume that from the earliest times they were identified by their own proper names and since they got them they were never changed through the course of history: they were called Jupiter and Juno. These gods were the most ancient deities of every Latin town. Praeneste preserved divine filiation and infancy as the sovereign god and his paredra Juno have a mother who is the primordial goddess Fortuna Primigenia.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''Déesses latines et mythes vediques'' p. 96 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Many terracotta statuettes have been discovered which represent a woman with a child: one of them represents exactly the scene described by Cicero of a woman with two children of different sex who touch her breast. Two of the votive inscriptions to Fortuna associate her and Jupiter: " Fortunae Iovi puero..." and "Fortunae Iovis puero..."&lt;ref&gt;CIL XIV 2868 and 2862 (mutile).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882 though R. Mowat published an inscription in which Fortuna is called ''daughter of Jupiter'', raising new questions and opening new perspectives in the theology of Latin gods.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mowat "Inscription latine sur plaque de bronze acquise à Rome par par M. A. Dutuit"  in ''Mem. de la Soc. nat. des Antiquités de France'' 5me Ser. 3  '''43''' 1882 p. 200: CIL XIV 2863: ORCEVIA NUMERI/ NATIONU CRATIA/  FORTUNA DIOVO FILEA/ PRIMOCENIA/ DONOM DEDI. Cited by G. Dumezil above p. 71 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumezil has elaborated an interpretative theory according to which this ''aporia'' would be an intrinsic, fundamental feature of Indoeuropean deities of the primordial and sovereign level, as it finds a parallel in Vedic religion.&lt;ref&gt;G Dumezil ''Déesses latines et mythes vediques'' Bruxelles 1956 chapt. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The contradiction would put Fortuna both at the origin of time and into its ensuing diachronic process: it is the comparison offered by Vedic deity [[Aditi]], the ''Not-Bound'' or ''Enemy of Bondage'', that shows that there is no question of choosing one of the two apparent options: as the mother of the [[Aditya]] she has the same type of relationship with one of his sons, [[Dakṣa]], the minor sovereign. who represents the ''Creative Energy'', being at the same time his mother and daughter, as is true for the whole group of sovereign gods to which she belongs.&lt;ref&gt;Ṛg-Veda X 72, 4-5; G. Dumezil above and ''Mariages indo-européens'' pp. 311–312: "Of Aditi Daksa was born, and of Daksa Aditi, o Daksa, she who is your daughter".&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Aditi is thus one of the heirs (along with [[Savitr]]) of the opening god of the Indoiranians, as she is represented with her head on her two sides, with the two faces looking opposite directions.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''Déesses latines...'' p. 91 n.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The mother of the sovereign gods has thence two solidal but distinct modalities of duplicity, i.e. of having two foreheads and a double position in the genealogy. Angelo Brelich has interpreted this theology as the basic opposition between the primordial absence of order (chaos) and the organisation of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;A. Brelich ''Tre variazioni romane sul tema delle origini. I. Roma e Preneste. Una polemica religiosa nell'Italia antica'' Pubbl. dell'Univ. di Roma 1955–1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Janus===
{{Main|Janus}}
The relation of Jupiter to Janus is problematic. Varro defines Jupiter as the god who has ''potestas'' (power) over the forces by which anything happens in the world. Janus, however, has the privilege of being invoked first in rites, since in his power are the beginnings of things (''prima''), the appearance of Jupiter included.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 101 and 290. Discussed at length by Augustine, ''City of God'' VII 9 and 10. Also Ovid ''Fasti'' I 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saturn===
{{Main|Saturn (mythology)}}
The [[Latini|Latins]] considered Saturn the predecessor of Jupiter. Saturn reigned in [[Latium]] during a mythical [[Golden Age]] reenacted every year at the festival of [[Saturnalia]]. Saturn also retained primacy in matters of agriculture and money. Unlike the Greek tradition of [[Cronus]] and Zeus, the usurpation of Saturn as king of the gods by Jupiter was not viewed by the Latins as violent or hostile; Saturn continued to be revered in his temple at the foot of the Capitol Hill, which maintained the alternative name ''Saturnius'' into the time of Varro.&lt;ref&gt;D. Briquel "Jupiter, Saturne et le Capitol" in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''198''' 2. 1981 pp. 131–162; Varro V 42;  Vergil ''Aeneis''  VIII 357-8;  Dionysius Hal. I 34; Solinus I 12; Festus p. 322 L; Tertullian ''Apologeticum'' 10; Macrobius I 7, 27 and I 10, 4 citing a certain Mallius. See also Macrobius I 7, 3: the annalistic tradition attributed its foundation to king Tullus Hostilius. Studies by E. Gjerstad in ''Mélanges Albert Grenier'' Bruxelles 1962 pp. 757–762; Filippo Coarelli in ''La Parola del Passato'' '''174''' 1977 p. 215 f.&lt;/ref&gt;
A. Pasqualini has argued that Saturn was related to ''Iuppiter Latiaris'', the old Jupiter of the Latins, as the original figure of this Jupiter was superseded on the Alban Mount, whereas it preserved its gruesome character in the ceremony held at the sanctuary of the Latiar Hill in Rome which involved a human sacrifice and the aspersion of the statue of the god with the blood of the victim.&lt;ref&gt;A. Pasqualini "Note sull'ubicazione del Latiar" in ''MEFRA'' '''111''' 1999 2 p[. 784–785 citing M. Malavolta "I ''ludi'' delle ''feriae Latinae'' a Roma" in A. Pasqualini (ed.) ''Alba Longa.

===Fides===
{{Main|Fides (mythology)}} 
The abstract [[personification]] Fides ("Faith, Trust") was one of the oldest gods associated with Jupiter. As guarantor of public faith, Fides had her temple on the Capitol (near that of Capitoline Jupiter).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|pages=100–101}}; G. Dumézil above p. 348; Cicero ''De Natura Deorum'' II 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dius Fidius===
{{Main|Dius Fidius}}
''Dius Fidius'' is considered a [[theonym]] for Jupiter,&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''La religion Romaine archaïque'' Paris, 1974; It. tr. Milan 1977 p.189.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes a separate entity also known in Rome as [[Sancus|Semo Sancus]] Dius Fidius. Wissowa argued that while Jupiter is the god of the ''Fides Publica Populi Romani'' as ''Iuppiter Lapis'' (by whom important oaths are sworn), Dius Fidius is a deity established for everyday use and was charged with the protection of good faith in private affairs. Dius Fidius would thus correspond to ''Zeus Pistios''.{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=103}} The association with Jupiter may be a matter of divine relation; some scholars see him as a form of Hercules.&lt;ref&gt;Roger D. Woodard ''Vedic and Indo-European Sacred Space'' Chicago Illinois Un. Press 2005 p. 189. The scholar thinks Dius Fidius is the Roman equivalent of Trita Apya, the companion of Indra in the slaying of Vrtra.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Jupiter and Dius Fidius were wardens of oaths and wielders of lightning bolts; both required an opening in the roof of their temples.&lt;ref name="G. Dumézil ARR above p. 169"/&gt;

The functionality of Sancus occurs consistently within the sphere of ''fides'', oaths and respect for contracts and of the divine-sanction guarantee against their breach. Wissowa suggested that Semo Sancus is the ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]'' of Jupiter,&lt;ref name="Roschers Lexicon' 1912, p. 131"&gt;G. Wissowa in ''Roschers Lexicon'' 1909 s.v. Semo Sancus col. 3654; ''Religion und Kultus der Römer'' Munich, 1912, p. 131 f.&lt;/ref&gt; but the concept of a deity's ''genius'' is a development of the Imperial period.&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Fowler ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London, 1899, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some aspects of the oath-ritual for Dius Fidius (such as proceedings under the open sky or in the ''compluvium'' of private residences), and the fact the temple of Sancus had no roof, suggest that the oath sworn by Dius Fidius predated that for ''Iuppiter Lapis'' or ''Iuppiter Feretrius''.&lt;ref&gt;O. Sacchi "Il trivaso del Quirinale" in ''Revue internationale de droit de l'Antiquité'' 2001 pp. 309–311, citing Nonius Marcellus s.v. rituis (L p. 494): ''Itaque domi rituis nostri, qui per dium Fidium iurare vult, prodire solet in compluvium.'', 'thus according to our rites he who wishes to swear an oath by Dius Fidius he as a rule walks to the ''compluvium'' (an unroofed space within the house)'; Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 11, 5 on the use of the private ''mensa'' as an altar mentioned in the ''ius Papirianum''; Granius Flaccus ''indigitamenta'' 8 (H. 109) on king Numa's vow by which he asked for the divine punishment of perjury by all the gods.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genius===
{{Main|Genius (mythology)}}

Augustine quotes Varro who explains the ''genius'' as "the god who is in charge and has the power to generate everything" and "the rational spirit of all (therefore, everyone has their own)". Augustine concludes that Jupiter should be considered the ''genius'' of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine CD VII 13, referencing also [[Quintus Valerius Soranus]]. H. Wagenvoort "''Genius'' a ''genendo''" ''Mnemosyne'' 4. Suppl., 4, 1951, pp. 163–168. G. Dumézil ARR above p. 315, discussing G. Wissowa and K. Latte' s opinions.&lt;/ref&gt;

G. Wissowa advanced the hypothesis that Semo [[Sancus]] is the genius of Jupiter.&lt;ref name="Roschers Lexicon' 1912, p. 131" /&gt; W. W. Fowler has cautioned that this interpretation looks to be an anachronism and it would only be acceptable to say that Sancus is a ''Genius Iovius'', as it appears from the Iguvine Tables.&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Fowler ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London, 1899, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Censorinus cites [[Granius Flaccus]] as saying that "the Genius was the same entity as the Lar" in his lost work ''De Indigitamentis''.&lt;ref&gt;Censorinus ''De Die Natali'' 3, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; probably referring to the ''[[Lar Familiaris]]''. [[Mutunus Tutunus]] had his shrine at the foot of the Velian Hill near those of the Di Penates and of Vica Pota, who were among the most ancient gods of the Roman community of according to Wissowa.&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa ''Kultus'' 1912 p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumézil opines that the attribution of a Genius to the gods should be earlier than its first attestation of 58 BC, in an inscription which mentions the ''Iovis Genius''.&lt;ref&gt;CIL IX 3513 from the ''lex templi'' of the temple of ''Iuppiter Liber '' at Furfo, Samnium.&lt;/ref&gt;

A connection between Genius and Jupiter seems apparent in [[Plautus]]' comedy ''[[Amphitryon]]'', in which Jupiter takes up the looks of [[Alcmene|Alcmena]]'s husband in order to seduce her: J. Hubeaux sees there a reflection of the story that [[Scipio Africanus]]' mother conceived him with a snake that was in fact Jupiter transformed.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius ''Noctes Atticae'' VI 1, 6. Silius Italicus ''Punica'' XIII 400-413. Cited by G. Dumézil ARR above p. 435, referencing J. Hubeaux ''Les grands mythes de Rome'' Paris 1945 pp. 81–82 and J. Aymard "Scipion l' Africain et les chiens du Capitol" in ''Revue d'études latins'' '''31''' 1953 pp. 111–116.&lt;/ref&gt; Scipio himself claimed that only he would rise to the mansion of the gods through the widest gate.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Republica'' VI 13: = ''[[Somnium Scipionis]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Etruscan ''Penates'' there is a ''Genius Iovialis'' who comes after ''Fortuna'' and ''Ceres'' and before ''Pales''.&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' IV 40, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Genius Iovialis is one of the ''Penates'' of the humans and not of Jupiter though, as these were located in region I of Martianus Capella' s division of Heaven, while Genius appears in regions V and VI along with Ceres, Favor (possibly a Roman approximation to an Etruscan male manifestation of Fortuna) and Pales.&lt;ref&gt;G. Capdeville "Les dieux de Martianus Capella" in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''213''' 1996 3. p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in accord with the definition of the Penates of man being Fortuna, Ceres, Pales and Genius Iovialis and the statement in Macrobius that the Larentalia were dedicated to Jupiter as the god whence the souls of men come from and to whom they return after death.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius I 10, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summanus===
{{Main|Summanus}}
The god of nighttime lightning has been interpreted as an aspect of Jupiter, either a [[chthonic]] manifestation of the god or a separate god of the underworld. A statue of Summanus stood on the roof of the Temple of Capitoline Jupiter, and ''Iuppiter Summanus'' is one of the epithets of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;E. and A. L. Prosdocimi in ''Etrennes M. Lejeune'' Paris 1978 pp. 199–207 identify him as an aspect of Jupiter. See also A. L.  Prosdocimi "'Etimologie di teonimi: Venilia, Summano, Vacuna" in ''Studi linguistici in onore di Vittore Pisani '' Milano 1969 pp. 777–802.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil sees the opposition Dius Fidius versus Summanus as complementary, interpreting it as typical to the inherent ambiguity of the sovereign god exemplified by that of Mitra and Varuna in Vedic religion.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 184–185 citing his ''Mitra Varuna, essai sur deux représentations indo-européennes de la souveraineté'' Paris 1940–1948.&lt;/ref&gt; The complementarity of the epithets is shown in inscriptions found on ''puteal''s or ''bidental''s reciting either ''fulgur Dium conditum''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=107}}, citing CIL VI 205; X 49 and 6423.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''fulgur Summanum conditum'' in places struck by daytime versus nighttime lightning bolts respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912}}, CIL VI 206.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also consistent with the etymology of ''Summanus'', deriving from ''sub'' and ''mane'' (the time before morning).&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liber===
{{See also|Liber}}
''Iuppiter'' was associated with [[Liber]] through his epithet of ''Liber'' (association not yet been fully explained by scholars, due to the scarcity of early documentation).
In the past, it was maintained that Liber was only a progressively-detached [[wikt:hypostasis|hypostasis]] of Jupiter; consequently, the vintage festivals were to be attributed only to ''Iuppiter Liber''.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Preller ''Rõmische Mythologie'' I Berlin 1881 pp. 195–197; E. Aust s. v. Iuppiter (Liber) in ''Roscher lexicon'' II column 661 f.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a hypothesis was rejected as groundless by Wissowa, although he was a supporter of Liber's Jovian origin.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier de Cazanove cites {{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=120}} and A. Schnegelsberg ''De Liberi apud Romanos cultu capita duo'' Dissertation Marburg 1895 p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Olivier de Cazanove&lt;ref&gt;O. de Cazanove "Jupiter, Liber et le vin latin" in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''205''' 1988 3 p. 247 n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  contends that it is difficult to admit that Liber (who is present in the oldest calendars—those of Numa—in the ''Liberalia'' and in the month of ''Liber'' at Lavinium)&lt;ref name="CDVII21"&gt;Augustine CD VII 21.&lt;/ref&gt; was derived from another deity. Such a derivation would find support only in epigraphic documents, primarily from the Osco-Sabellic area.&lt;ref&gt;Inscriptions from the territory of the Frentani  (Zvetaieff  ''Sylloge inscriptionum Oscarum'' nr. 3); Vestini (CIL IX 3513; I 2nd 756 Furfo); Sabini  (Jordan  ''Analecta epigraphica latina'' p. 3 f.= CIL I 2nd 1838) and Campani  (CIL X 3786 ''Iovi Liber(o)'' Capua).&lt;/ref&gt; Wissowa sets the position of ''Iuppiter Liber'' within the framework of an agrarian Jupiter. The god also had a temple in this name on the Aventine in Rome, which was restored by Augustus and dedicated on September 1. Here, the god was sometimes named ''Liber''&lt;ref&gt;Fasti Arvales ad 1. September.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes ''Libertas''.&lt;ref&gt;Monumentum Ancyranum IV 7; CIL XI 657 Faventia; XIV 2579 Tusculum.&lt;/ref&gt; Wissowa opines that the relationship existed in the concept of creative abundance through which the supposedly-separate Liber might have been connected{{sfnp|Wissowa|1912|page=106}} to the Greek god [[Dionysos]], although both deities might not have been originally related to [[viticulture]].

Other scholars assert that there was no Liber (other than a god of wine) within historical memory.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Bömer ''Untersuchungen über die Religion der Sklaven in Griechenland und Rom'' I Wiesbaden 1957 p. 127 f. cited by Olivier de Cazanove "Jupiter, Liber et le vin" in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''205''' 1988 3 p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; O. de Cazanove&lt;ref&gt;O. de Cazanove above p. 248 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the domain of the sovereign god Jupiter was that of sacred, sacrificial wine (''vinum inferium''),&lt;ref&gt;[[Trebatius Testa]] apud Arnobius ''Ad nationes'' VII 31: "''solum quod inferetur sacrum...''" "only that which is spilt is considered sacred...";also Cato ''De Agri Cultura'' CXXXII 2; CXXXIV 3; Servius IX 641; Isidore XX 2,7.&lt;/ref&gt; while that of Liber and Libera was confined to secular wine (''vinum spurcum'');&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Antistius Labeo]] apud Festus s. v., p. 474 L.&lt;/ref&gt; these two types were obtained through differing fermentation processes. The offer of wine to Liber was made possible by naming the ''mustum'' (grape juice) stored in [[amphora]]s ''sacrima''.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Altheim ''Terra Mater'' Giessen 1931 p. 22 and n. 4 while acknowledging the obscurity of the etymology of this word proposed the derivation from ''sacerrima'' as ''bruma'' from ''brevissima''; ''Onomata Latina et Graeca'' s.v.:  ''novum vinum''; ''Corpus Glossatorum Latinorum'' II p. 264: απαρχη γλεύκους.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sacred wine was obtained by the natural fermentation of juice of grapes free from flaws of any type, religious (e. g. those struck by lightning, brought into contact with corpses or wounded people or coming from an unfertilised grapeyard) or secular (by "cutting" it with old wine). Secular (or "profane") wine was obtained through several types of manipulation (e.g.  by adding honey, or ''mulsum''; using raisins, or ''passum''; by boiling, or ''defrutum''). However, the ''sacrima'' used for the offering to the two gods for the preservation of grapeyards, vessels and wine&lt;ref&gt;Columella ''De Re Rustica'' XII 18, 4 mentions a sacrifice to Liber and Libera immediately before.&lt;/ref&gt; was obtained only by pouring the juice into amphors after pressing.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus s. v. sacrima p. 423 L; Festus p. 422 L (mutile).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''mustum'' was considered ''spurcum'' (dirty), and thus unusable in sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Isidore ''Origines'' XX 3, 4; Enrico Monatanari "Funzione della sovranitá e feste del vino nella Roma repubblicana" in ''Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni'' '''49''' 1983 pp. 242–262.&lt;/ref&gt; The amphor (itself not an item of sacrifice) permitted presentation of its content on a table or could be added to a sacrifice; this happened at the ''auspicatio vindamiae'' for the first grape&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil "Quaestiunculae indo-italicae" 14-16 in  ''Revue d' études latins'' XXXIX 1961 pp. 261–274.&lt;/ref&gt;  and for ears of corn of the ''praemetium'' on a dish (''lanx'') at the
temple of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]].&lt;ref&gt;Henri Le Bonniec ''Le culte de Cérès à Rome'' Paris 1958 pp. 160–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumézil, on the other hand, sees the relationship between Jupiter and Liber as grounded in the social and political relevance of the two gods (who were both considered patrons of freedom).&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 331–332.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Liberalia'' of March were, since earliest times, the occasion for the ceremony of the donning of the ''toga virilis'' or ''libera''  (which marked the passage into adult citizenship by young people). Augustine relates that these festivals had a particularly obscene character:  a ''phallus'' was taken to the fields on a cart, and then back in triumph to town. In [[Lavinium]] they lasted a month, during which the population enjoyed bawdy jokes. The most honest ''matronae'' were supposed to publicly crown the ''phallus'' with flowers, to ensure a good harvest and repeal the ''fascinatio'' (evil eye).&lt;ref name="CDVII21" /&gt; In Rome representations of the sex organs were placed in the temple of the couple ''Liber Libera'', who presided over the male and female components of generation and the "liberation" of the semen.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine CD VII 3, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This complex of rites and beliefs shows that the divine couple's jurisdiction extended over fertility in general, not only that of grapes. The etymology of  ''Liber'' (archaic form ''Loifer, Loifir'') was explained by Émile Benveniste as formed on the IE theme *leudh- plus the suffix -es-; its original meaning is "the one of germination, he who ensures the sprouting of crops".&lt;ref&gt;"Liber et liberi" in ''Revue d'études latins'' '''14''' 1936 pp. 52–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship of Jupiter with freedom was a common belief among the Roman people, as demonstrated by the dedication of the ''Mons Sacer'' to the god after the first secession of the ''plebs''. Later inscriptions also show the unabated popular belief in Jupiter as bestower of freedom in the imperial era.&lt;ref&gt;"''...curatores Iovi Libertati''" CIL XI 657 and "''Iovi Obsequenti publice''" CIL XI 658 from [[Bagnacavallo]]; "''Iuppiter Impetrabilis''" from Cremella sopra [[Monza]] published by G. Zecchini in ''Rivista di studi italiani e latini'' '''110''' 1976 pp. 178–182. The double presence of Jupiter and [[Feronia (goddess)|Feronia]] at Bagnacavallo has led to speculation that the servile ''[[manumissio]]'' (legal ritual action by which slaves were freed)  was practised in this sanctuary : Giancarlo Susini "San Pietro in Sylvis, santuario pagense e villaggio plebano nel Ravennate" in ''Mélanges offertes à G. Sanders'' Steenbrugge 1991 pp. 395–400. Cited in F. Cenerini above p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veiove===
{{Main|Vejovis}}
Scholars have been often puzzled by Ve(d)iove (or [[Veiovis]], or Vedius) and unwilling to discuss his identity, claiming our knowledge of this god is insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR It. tr. p. 188 n. 44; Kurt Latte  ''Römische Religionsgeschichte'' Munich 1960 p. 81 and n. 3.; W. Warde Fowler ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London 1899 pp. 121–122.&lt;/ref&gt; Most, however, agree that Veiove is a sort of special Jupiter or anti-Iove, or even an underworld Jupiter. In other words, Veiove is indeed the Capitoline god himself, who takes up a different, diminished appearance (''iuvenis'' and ''parvus'', young and gracile), in order to be able to discharge sovereign functions over places, times and spheres that by their own nature are excluded from the direct control of Jupiter as Optimus Maximus.&lt;ref&gt;G. Piccaluga "L' anti-Iupiter" in ''Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni'' XXXIV 1963 p. 229-236; E. Gierstad "Veiovis, a pre-indoeuropean God in Rome?" in ''Opuscola Romana'' 9, 4 1973 pp. 35–42.&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion is based on information provided by Gellius,&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius V 12.&lt;/ref&gt; who states his name is formed by adding prefix ''ve'' (here denoting "deprivation" or "negation") to ''Iove '' (whose name Gellius posits as rooted in the verb ''iuvo'' "I benefit"). D. Sabbatucci has stressed the feature of bearer of instability and antithesis to cosmic order of the god, who threatens the kingly power of Jupiter as ''Stator'' and ''Centumpeda'' and whose presence occurs side by side to Janus' on January 1, but also his function of helper to the growth of the young Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;D. Sabbatucci above as summarised by R. Turcan above p. 70 and pp. 72–73. On the aspect of making Jupiter grow up Turcan cites the denarii struck by [[Manius Fonteius]] and [[Valerian the younger]] of the type ''Iovi crescenti'' mentioned by [[A. Alföldi]] in ''Studien zur Geschichte der Weltkrisedes 3. Jhd. n.Chr.'' Darmstadt 1067 p. 112 f.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858 [[Ludwig Preller]] suggested that Veiovis may be the sinister double of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Preller ''Römische Mythologie'' I p. 262 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, the god (under the name ''Vetis'') is placed in the last case (number 16) of the outer rim of the Piacenza Liver—before ''Cilens'' (Nocturnus), who ends (or begins in the Etruscan vision) the disposition of the gods. In [[Martianus Capella]]'s division of heaven, he is found in region XV with the ''dii publici''; as such, he numbers among the infernal (or antipodal) gods. The location of his two temples in Rome—near those of Jupiter (one on the Capitoline Hill, in the low between the ''arx'' and the Capitolium, between the two groves where the [[asylum (antiquity)|asylum]] founded by Romulus stood, the other on the Tiber Island near that of  ''Iuppiter Iurarius'', later also known as temple of Aesculapius)&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' I 291–294.&lt;/ref&gt;—may be significant in this respect, along with the fact that he is considered the father&lt;ref&gt;Ferruccio Bernini ''Ovidio. I Fasti'' (translation and commentary), III 429; Bologna 1983 (reprint).&lt;/ref&gt; of Apollo, perhaps because he was depicted carrying arrows. He is also considered to be the unbearded Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius ''De Architectura'' IV 8, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The dates of his festivals support the same conclusion: they fall on January 1,&lt;ref&gt;Ovid above. Fasti Praenestini CIL I 2nd p. 231: ''Aescu]lapio Vediovi in insula''.&lt;/ref&gt; March 7&lt;ref&gt;Fasti Praen.: ''Non. Mart. F(as)...]ovi artis Vediovis inter duos lucos''; Ovid ''Fasti'' III 429–430.&lt;/ref&gt; and May 21,&lt;ref&gt;Ovid above V 721–722. ''XII Kal. Iun. NP Agonia'' (Esq. Caer. Ven. Maff.); ''Vediovi'' (Ven.).&lt;/ref&gt; the first date being the recurrence of the [[Agonalia]], dedicated to Janus and celebrated by the king with the sacrifice of a ram. The nature of the sacrifice is debated; Gellius states ''capra'', a female goat, although some scholars posit a ram. This sacrifice occurred ''rito humano'', which may mean "with the rite appropriate for human sacrifice".&lt;ref&gt;Wissowa on the grounds of Paulus's glossa ''humanum sacrificium'' p. 91 L interprets "with a rite proper to a ceremony in honour of the deceased". G. Piccaluga at n. 15 and 21 pp. 231-232 though remarks that Gellius does not state ''sacrificium humanum'' but only states...''immolaturque ritu humano capra''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gellius concludes by stating that this god is one of those who receive sacrifices so as to persuade them to refrain from causing harm.

The arrow is an ambivalent symbol; it was used in the ritual of the [[devotio]] (the general who vowed had to stand on an arrow).&lt;ref&gt;Livy VIII 9, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is perhaps because of the arrow and of the juvenile looks that Gellius identifies Veiove with Apollo&lt;ref&gt;Gellius V 12, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a god who must receive worship in order to obtain his abstention from harming men, along with [[Robigus]] and [[Averruncus]].&lt;ref&gt;Gellius V 12. The Romans knew and offered a cult to other such deities: among them ''Febris'', ''Tussis'', ''Mefitis''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ambivalence in the identity of Veiove is apparent in the fact that while he is present in places and times which may have a negative connotation (such as the ''asylum'' of Romulus in between the two groves on the Capitol, the Tiberine island along with Faunus and Aesculapius, the kalends of January, the nones of March, and May 21, a statue of his nonetheless stands in the ''arx''. Moreover, the initial particle ''ve-'' which the ancient supposed were part of his name is itself ambivalent as it may have both an accrescitive and diminutive value.&lt;ref&gt;G. Piccaluga "L' anti-Juppiter" in ''Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni'' XXXIV 1963 p. 233-234 and notes 30, 31 citing Gellius V 12 and Pliny the Elder ''Naturalis Historia''  XVI 216: "''Non et simulacrum Veiovis in arce?''".&lt;/ref&gt;

Maurice Besnier has remarked that a temple to ''Iuppiter'' was dedicated by ''praetor'' Lucius Furius Purpureo before the [[Battle of Cremona (200 BC)|battle of Cremona]] against the [[Cenomani (Cisalpine Gaul)|Celtic Cenomani of Cisalpine Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy XXXI 21.&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription found at [[Brescia]] in 1888 shows that ''Iuppiter Iurarius'' was worshipped there&lt;ref&gt;Ettore Pais CIL ''Supplementa Italica'' I ''addimenta al CIL V'' in ''Atti dei Lincei, Memorie'' V 1888 n. 1272: ''I O M IUR D(e) C(onscriptorum) S(ententia)''.&lt;/ref&gt; and one found on the south tip of Tiber Island in 1854 that there was a cult to the god on the spot too.&lt;ref&gt;CIL I 1105: ''C. Volcaci C.  F Har. de stipe Iovi Iurario... onimentum''.&lt;/ref&gt; Besnier speculates that Lucius Furius had evoked the chief god of the enemy and built a temple to him in Rome outside the ''pomerium''. On January 1, the ''Fasti Praenestini'' record the festivals of Aesculapius and Vediove on the Island, while in the ''Fasti'' Ovid speaks of ''Jupiter'' and his grandson.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' I 291–295.&lt;/ref&gt; Livy records that in 192 BC, ''duumvir'' Q. Marcus Ralla dedicated to Jupiter on the Capitol the two temples promised by L. Furius Purpureo, one of which was that promised during the war against the Gauls.&lt;ref&gt;Livy XXXV 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Besnier would accept a correction to Livy's passage (proposed by Jordan) to read ''aedes Veiovi'' instead of ''aedes duae Iovi''.  Such a correction concerns the temples dedicated on the Capitol: it does not address the question of the dedication of the temple on the Island, which is puzzling, since the place is attested epigraphically as dedicated to the cult of  ''Iuppiter Iurarius'', in the ''Fasti Praenestini'' of ''Vediove''&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. above: "''Aeculapio Vediovi in insula''".&lt;/ref&gt; and to Jupiter according to Ovid. The two gods may have been seen as equivalent: ''Iuppiter Iurarius'' is an awesome and vengeful god, parallel to the Greek ''Zeus Orkios'', the avenger of perjury.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Besnier "Jupiter Jurarius" in ''Mélanges d'archéologie et d' histoire'' '''18''' 1898 pp. 287–289.&lt;/ref&gt;

A. Pasqualini has argued that Veiovis seems related to ''Iuppiter Latiaris'', as the original figure of this Jupiter would have been superseded on the Alban Mount, whereas it preserved its gruesome character in the ceremony held on the sanctuary of the Latiar Hill, the southernmost hilltop of the [[Quirinal]] in Rome, which involved a human sacrifice. The [[gens Iulia]] had gentilician cults at [[Bovillae]] where a dedicatory inscription to Vediove has been found in 1826 on an ara.&lt;ref&gt;CIL XIV 2387 = ILS 2988 = ILLRP 270=CIL I 807: ''Vediovei patrei genteiles Iuliei leege Albana dicata''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pasqualini it was a deity similar to Vediove, wielder of lightningbolts and chthonic, who was connected to the cult of the founders who first inhabited the Alban Mount and built the sanctuary. Such a cult once superseded on the Mount would have been taken up and preserved by the Iulii, private citizens bound to the ''sacra Albana'' by their Alban origin.&lt;ref&gt;A. Pasqualini "Le basi documenatarie della ''leggenda'' di Alba Longa" Universita' di Roma Torvergata 2012 online.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria===
{{See also|Victoria (mythology)}}
[[File:RSC 0009.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Coin with [[Laurel wreath|laureate]] head of Jupiter ([[Obverse and reverse|obverse]]) and (reverse) Victory, standing ("''ROMA''" below in [[relief]])|alt=Roman coin, with bearded head on front and standing figure on reverse]]
Victoria was connected to ''Iuppiter Victor'' in his role as bestower of military victory. Jupiter, as a sovereign god, was considered as having the power to conquer anyone and anything in a supernatural way; his contribution to military victory was different from that of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] (god of military valour). Victoria appears first on the reverse of coins representing Venus (driving the quadriga of Jupiter, with her head crowned and with a palm in her hand) during the first Punic War.  Sometimes, she is represented walking and carrying a trophy.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

A temple was dedicated to the goddess afterwards on the Palatine, testifying to her high station in the Roman mind. When [[Hieron of Syracuse]] presented a golden statuette of the goddess to Rome, the Senate had it placed in the temple of Capitoline Jupiter among the greatest (and most sacred) deities.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 413. Livy XXVII 2, 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Victoria played a significant role in the religious ideology of the late Republic and the Empire, she is undocumented in earlier times. A function similar to hers may have been played by the little-known [[Vica Pota]].

===Terminus===
{{See also|Terminus (god)}}
Juventas and Terminus were the gods who, according to legend,&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Rom. Antiquities''  III 69, 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; refused to leave their sites on the Capitol when the construction of the temple of Jupiter was undertaken. Therefore, they had to be reserved a ''sacellum'' within the new temple. Their stubbornness was considered a good omen; it would guarantee youth, stability and safety to Rome on its site.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus above III 69; Florus I 7, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; This legend is generally thought by scholars to indicate their strict connection with Jupiter. An inscription found near [[Ravenna]] reads ''Iuppiter Ter.'',&lt;ref&gt;CIL XI 351.&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that Terminus is an aspect of Jupiter.

Terminus is the god of boundaries (public and private), as he is portrayed in literature. The religious value of the [[boundary marker]] is documented by Plutarch,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''Numa'' 16.&lt;/ref&gt; who ascribes to king Numa the construction of temples to Fides and Terminus and the delimitation of Roman territory. Ovid gives a vivid description of the rural rite at a boundary of fields of neighbouring peasants on February 23 (the day of the [[Terminus (mythology)#Worship|Terminalia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' II 679.&lt;/ref&gt; On that day, Roman pontiffs and magistrates held a ceremony at the sixth mile of the [[Via Laurentina]] (ancient border of the Roman ''ager'', which maintained a religious value). 
This festival, however, marked the end of the year and was linked to time more directly than to space (as attested by Augustine's [[Apologetics|apologia]] on the role of Janus with respect to endings).&lt;ref&gt;Augustine CD VII 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dario Sabbatucci has emphasised the temporal affiliation of Terminus, a reminder of which is found in the rite of the ''regifugium''.&lt;ref&gt;D. Sabbatucci above.&lt;/ref&gt; 
G. Dumézil, on the other hand, views the function of this god as associated with the legalistic aspect of the sovereign function of Jupiter. Terminus would be the counterpart of the minor Vedic god Bagha, who oversees the just and fair division of goods among citizens.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iuventas===
{{See also|Iuventas}}

Along with ''Terminus'', '' Iuventas'' (also known as  ''Iuventus'' and ''Iuunta'') represents an aspect of Jupiter (as the legend of her refusal to leave the Capitol Hill demonstrates. Her name has the same root as [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] (from ''Iuu-'', "young, youngster"); the ceremonial litter bearing the sacred goose of Juno Moneta stopped before her ''sacellum'' on the festival of the goddess. Later, she was identified with the Greek [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]]. The fact that Jupiter is related to the concept of youth is shown by his epithets ''Puer'', ''Iuuentus'' and ''Ioviste'' (interpreted as "the youngest" by some scholars).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=135}}; G. Dumezil ''La relig. rom. arch.'' Paris 1974; It. tr. Milano 1977 pp. 185–186; C. W. Atkins "Latin 'Iouiste' et le vocabulaire religieux indoeuropéen" in ''Mélanges Benveniste'' Paris, 1975, pp. 527–535.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil noted the presence of the two minor sovereign deities Bagha and [[Aryaman]] beside the Vedic sovereign gods Varuna and Mitra (though more closely associated with Mitra); the couple would be reflected in Rome by ''Terminus'' and ''Iuventas''. Aryaman is the god of young soldiers. The function of ''Iuventas'' is to protect the ''iuvenes'' (the ''novi togati'' of the year, who are required to offer a sacrifice to Jupiter on the Capitol)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wissowa|1912|page=135}}, citing Servius Danielis  ''Eclogae'' IV 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Roman soldiers (a function later attributed to Juno). King Servius Tullius, in reforming the Roman social organisation, required that every adolescent offer a coin to the goddess of youth upon entering adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Piso apud Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Rom. Antiquities'' IV 15, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dumézil's analysis, the function of ''Iuventas'' (the personification of youth), was to control the entrance of young men into society and protect them until they reach the age of ''iuvenes'' or ''iuniores'' (i.e. of serving the state as soldiers).&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt;
A temple to ''Iuventas'' was promised in 207 BC by consul [[Marcus Livius Salinator]] and dedicated in 191 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Livy XXXV 36, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penates===
{{See also|Penates}}
The Romans considered the Penates as the gods to whom they owed their own existence.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 4, 8–9 citing Varro: "Per quos penitus spiramus". Sabine Mac Cormack ''The Shadows of Poetry: Vergil in the Mind of Augustine'' University of California Press 1998 p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Wissowa ''Penates'' is an adjective, meaning "those of or from the ''penus''" the innermost part, most hidden recess;&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above pp. 311–312.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil though refuses Wissowa's interpretation of ''penus'' as the storeroom of a household. As a nation the Romans honoured the ''Penates publici'': Dionysius calls them ''Trojan gods'' as they were absorbed into the Trojan legend. They had a temple in Rome at the foot of the [[Velian Hill]], near the Palatine, in which they were represented as a couple of male youth. They were honoured every year by the new consuls before entering office at [[Lavinium]],&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''De Lingua Latina'' V 144; Plutarch ''Coriolanus'' XXIX 2; Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 4, 11; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' II 296: as cited by Dumézil ARR above p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; because the Romans believed the Penates of that town were identical to their own.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR above p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''di Penates'' is more defined in Etruria: [[Arnobius]] (citing a Caesius) states that the Etruscan Penates were named Fortuna, Ceres, Genius Iovialis and Pales; according to [[Nigidius Figulus]], they included those of Jupiter, of Neptune, of the infernal gods and of mortal men.&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius ''Adversus nationes'' III 40. Cf. also Lucan ''Pharsalia'' V 696; VII 705; VIII 21.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Varro the Penates reside in the recesses of Heaven and are called ''Consentes'' and ''Complices'' by the Etruscans because they rise and set together, are twelve in number and their names are unknown, six male and six females and are the cousellors and masters of Jupiter. Martianus states they are always in agreement among themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 40, 3; Martianus Capella ''De Nuptiis'' I 41: "Senatores deorum qui Penates ferebantur Tonantis ipsius quorumque nomina, quoniam publicari secretum caeleste non pertulit, ex eo quod omnia pariter repromittunt, nomen eis consensione perficit".&lt;/ref&gt; While these last gods seem to be the Penates of Jupiter, Jupiter himself along with Juno and Minerva is one of the Penates of man according to some authors.&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 40 4;  Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 4 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

This complex concept is reflected in Martianus Capella's division of heaven, found in Book I of his ''De Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae'', which places the ''Di Consentes Penates'' in region I with the ''Favores Opertanei''; ''Ceres'' and ''Genius'' in region V; ''Pales'' in region VI; ''Favor'' and ''Genius'' (again) in region VII; ''Secundanus Pales'', ''Fortuna'' and ''Favor Pastor'' in region XI. The disposition of these divine entities and their repetition in different locations may be due to the fact that ''Penates'' belonging to different categories (of Jupiter in region I, earthly or of mortal men in region V) are intended. ''Favor(es)'' may be the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] masculine equivalent of ''Fortuna''.&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Capdeville "Les dieux de Martianus Capella" in ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' '''213''' 1996 3 p. 285 citing Carl Olof Thulin ''Die Götter des Martianus Capella und der Bronzeleber von Piacenza'' (=RGVV 3. 1) Giessen 1906 pp. 38–39. On the topic see also A. L. Luschi  "Cacu, Fauno e i venti'  in ''Studi Etruschi''  '''57''' 1991 pp. 105–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Somnus''' ("sleep") is the personification of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aqDC5bwx4_wC&amp;pg=PA291 s.v. Somnus p. 291]; Tripp, s.v. Somnus, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt; His Greek counterpart is [[Hypnos]]. Somnus resided in the underworld. According to [[Virgil]], Somnus was the brother of Death ([[Mors (mythology)|Mors]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0690.phi003.perseus-eng2:6.268-6.281 6.278]&lt;/ref&gt; and according to [[Ovid]], Somnus had a 'thousand' sons,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.633].&lt;/ref&gt; the '''Somnia''' ('dream shapes'), who appear in dreams 'mimicking many forms'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.163.xml 11.613].&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid named three of the sons of Somnus: [[Morpheus]], who appears in human guise, [[Phobetor|Icelos / Phobetor]], who appears as beasts, and [[Phantasos]], who appears as inanimate objects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.633&amp;ndash;643].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek tradition==
In the Greek tradition, [[Hypnos]] (Sleep) was the brother of [[Thanatos]] (Death), and the son of [[Nyx]] (Night).&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:207-239 211&amp;ndash;212]; [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:14.193-14.241 14.231], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:16.659-16.697 16.672].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hesiod, Sleep, along with Death, live in the underworld,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:729-766 758&amp;ndash;759].&lt;/ref&gt; while in the [[Homeric]] tradition, although "the land of dreams" was located on the road to the underworld, near the great world-encircling river [[Oceanus]], nearby the city of [[Cimmerians]],&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 234; [[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:11.1-11.50 11.13&amp;ndash;14], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:24.1-24.34 24.11&amp;ndash;14].&lt;/ref&gt; Sleep himself lived on the island of [[Lemnos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:14.193-14.241 14.230&amp;ndash;231], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:14.270-14.311 14.281].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virgil==

Following the Greek tradition, [[Virgil]] makes Sleep and Death brothers, and locates their dwellings next to each other, near the entrance of the underworld:
::In the first courts and entrances of Hell
::Sorrows and vengeful Cares on couches lie :
::There sad Old Age abides, Diseases pale,
::And Fear, and Hunger, temptress to all crime;
::Want, base and vile, and, two dread shapes to see,
::Bondage and Death : then Sleep, Death's next of kin;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0690.phi003.perseus-eng2:6.268-6.281 6.273&amp;ndash;278]&lt;/ref&gt;

Somnus makes a brief appearance in [[Virgil]]'s  ''[[Aeneid]]''. Virgil has Somnus cause [[Palinurus]], the [[helmsman]] of [[Aeneas]]'s ship, to fall asleep while steering the ship at night.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0690.phi003.perseus-eng2:5.827-5.851 5.838&amp;ndash;860].&lt;/ref&gt; Somnus, in the guise of Phorbas, a shipmate, appears to Palinurus and offers to take over, so that Palinurus might rest awhile. But Palinurus refused the offer, so Somnus uses a branch, "imbued" with the power of underworld's river [[Styx]], to sprinkle Palinurus with water from the river [[Lethe]], the underworld's river of forgetfulness. Palinurus then falls asleep, and Somnus pushes him overboard.

==Ovid==

Somnus, and his sons the Somnia appear in [[Ovid]]'s poem ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.161.xml 11.573&amp;ndash;677]; for a detailed discussion, see Griffin, pp. 234&amp;ndash;256. Ovid's Somnus episode became the model for, what Griffin, p. 236, describes as  "Statius' exercise in ''imatatio''", see [[Statius]], ''[[Thebaid]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/statius-thebaid/2004/pb_LCL498.133.xml 10.84&amp;ndash;131].
&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid, like Virgil before him, followed Hesiod in making Sleep a denizen of the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; However, recalling the location of the 'land of dreams' in the ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Ovid]] also locates the dwelling of Somnus "near the land of the [[Cimmerians]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.163.xml 11.592].&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid has Somnus live in a cave, describing "the home and chamber of sluggish Sleep"&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.163.xml 11.593].&lt;/ref&gt; as a place where:
:Phoebus [the Sun] can never enter ... with his rising, noontide, or setting rays. Clouds of vapour breathe forth from the earth, and dusky twilight shadows. There no wakeful, crested cock with his loud crowing summons the dawn; no watch-dog breaks the deep silence with his baying, or goose, more watchful than the dog. There is no sound of wild beast or of cattle, of branches rustling in the breeze, no clamorous tongues of men. There mute silence dwells.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.163.xml 11.594&amp;ndash;602].&lt;/ref&gt;
In keeping with this theme of "silence", Ovid says that Somnus' house has no doors, "lest some turning hinge should creak".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.163.xml 11.608&amp;ndash;609].&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Virgil, Ovid associates Somnus with the underworld's river Lethe, which Ovid has flowing from the bottom of Somnus' cave, and "whose waves, gently murmuring over the gravelly bed, invite to slumber."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.163.xml 11.602&amp;ndash;604].&lt;/ref&gt; Near the entrance bloom sleep-inducing poppies and other herbs, which Nox (Night) uses to spread sleep over "the darkened lands."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.163.xml 11.605&amp;ndash;607].&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ovid connects Night with Sleep, he makes no mention of Night being Sleep's mother as she is in Hesiod.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the center of the main chamber, Somnus lies "in languorous repose" on a "downy-soft" black couch, surrounded by his innumerable sons, the "empty dream-shapes [''Somnia vana''], mimicking many forms, many as ears of grain in harvest-time, as leaves upon the trees, as sands cast on the shore."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.163.xml 11.610&amp;ndash;615].&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid names three of these form-mimicking "dream shapes": Morpheus, Icelos/Phobetor, and Phantasos. About Morpheus, Ovid says "no other is more skilled than he in representing the gait, the features, and the speech of men; the clothing also and the accustomed words of each he represents."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.633&amp;ndash;638].&lt;/ref&gt; Another son called Icelos by the gods, but Phobetor by men, "takes the form of beast or bird or the long serpent", and a third son named Phantasos "puts on deceptive shapes of earth, rocks, water, trees, all lifeless things".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.638&amp;ndash;643].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book 11 of the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', Somnus becomes involved in Ovid's telling of the love story of [[Ceyx]] and his wife [[Alcyone]]. Ceyx has died in a storm at sea. [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] the queen of the gods, sends her messenger [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]] to the sleeping Somnus' cave, to command Somnus to send a dream to [[Alcyone]], in the form of Alcyone's husband [[Ceyx]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.163.xml 11.585&amp;ndash;587];  Griffin, p. 232, note to line 587.&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving at the cave, Iris brushes aside the many sleeping Somnia blocking her way, and her brightly gleaming clothes wake Somnus from his deep slumber.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.616&amp;ndash;622].&lt;/ref&gt; Iris addresses Somnus as "thou rest of all things, Sleep, mildest of the gods, balm of the soul, who puttest care to flight, soothest our bodies worn with hard ministries, and preparest them for toil again!", then orders Somnus to "Fashion a shape that shall seem true form" to be sent to Alcyone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.623&amp;ndash;629].&lt;/ref&gt; Iris immediately leaves before she herself is overcome with sleep, and Somnus wakes Morpheus to carry out what Juno has commanded, then goes back to sleep on his couch.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.630&amp;ndash;649].&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other gods associated with sleep, Ovid makes Somnus winged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL042.463.xml?rskey=mRHai7&amp;result=9 8.823].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="1215" xml:space="preserve">According to [[Cicero]] (On Divination, 2.41.85), the cult statue '''Jupiter-puer''' ("[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the Boy") stood directly adjacent to the site where the sacred lots of ancient [[Praeneste]] were first discovered inside a flint rock. This statue, which existed in Cicero's time, showed an infant Jupiter sitting with [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] in the lap of the goddess [[Fortuna]], reaching for her breast.

Italian archaeologist [[Filippo Coarelli]] has identified an engraving of the third-century BC that shows a boy sitting in a cave, handing a rectangular object to a hand reaching down, as a depiction of this Jupiter-puer.

[[Alexander Hislop]]'s book [[The Two Babylons]], described Jupiter-puer as a boy-saviour [[deity]] worshipped in [[ancient Rome]]. Hislop writes that he was depicted as sitting on his mother's lap, supposedly inspiring the image of the [[Virgin Mary]] and her son, [[Jesus]], in [[Roman Catholicism]].

The national divinity of the Greeks, Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery, music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the [[Sun]] and light, poetry, and more. One of the most important and complex of the Greek gods, he is the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin brother of [[Artemis]], goddess of the hunt. Seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the ''[[kouros]]'' (ephebe, or a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo is considered to be the most Greek of all the gods.{{Citation needed|date=April 2022}} Apollo is known in Greek-influenced [[Etruscan mythology]] as ''[[Apulu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, I. 2006. "The Grave and Beyond." ''The Religion of the Etruscans.'' edited by N. de Grummond and E. Simon. Austin: University of Texas Press. p. vii, p. 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the patron deity of [[Delphi]] (''Apollo Pythios''), Apollo is an [[oracular]] god—the prophetic [[deity]] of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]]. Apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil; various epithets call him the "averter of evil".

Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son [[Asclepius]]. Apollo delivered people from epidemics, yet he is also a god who could bring ill-health and deadly [[Plague (disease)|plague]] with his arrows. The invention of archery itself is credited to Apollo and his sister Artemis. Apollo is usually described as carrying a silver or golden bow and a quiver of silver or golden arrows. Apollo's capacity to make youths grow is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona. As a protector of the young ({{transliteration|grc|[[kourotrophos]]}}), Apollo is concerned with the health and education of children. He presided over their passage into adulthood. Long hair, which was the prerogative of boys, was cut at the coming of age ({{transliteration|grc|ephebeia}}) and dedicated to Apollo.

Apollo is an important pastoral deity, and was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds. Protection of herds, flocks and crops from diseases, pests and predators were his primary duties. On the other hand, Apollo also encouraged founding new towns and establishment of civil constitution. He is associated with dominion over [[Colonies in antiquity|colonists]]. He was the giver of laws, and his oracles were consulted before setting laws in a city.

As the god of ''mousike'',{{efn|''Mousike'' (the art of the Muses) was an integral part of life in the ancient Greek world, and the term covered not only music but also dance, lyrics, theatre and the performance of poetry.}} Apollo presides over all music, songs, dance and poetry. He is the inventor of string-music, and the frequent companion of the Muses, functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations. The lyre is a common [[#Attributes and symbols|attribute of Apollo]]. In Hellenistic times, especially during the 5th century BCE, as ''Apollo Helios'' he became identified among Greeks with [[Helios]], the personification of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;For the iconography of the Alexander–Helios type, see H. Hoffmann, 1963. "Helios", in ''Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt'' '''2''', pp. 117–23; cf. Yalouris 1980, no. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin texts, however, there was no [[conflation]] of Apollo with [[Sol (Roman mythology)|Sol]] among the classical Latin poets until 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fontenrose, "Apollo and Sol in the Latin poets of the first century BC", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' '''30''' (1939), pp 439–55; "Apollo and the Sun-God in Ovid", ''American Journal of Philology'' '''61''' (1940) pp 429–44; and "Apollo and Sol in the Oaths of Aeneas and Latinus" ''Classical Philology'' '''38'''.2 (April 1943), pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 5th century CE.

Apollo ([[Attic Greek|Attic]], [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]], and [[Homeric Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων}}, {{transliteration|grc|Apollōn}} ({{small|[[Genitive|GEN]]}} {{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλωνος}}); [[Doric Greek|Doric]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}, {{transliteration|grc|Apellōn}}; [[Arcadocypriot Greek|Arcadocypriot]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπείλων}}, {{transliteration|grc|Apeilōn}}; [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]]: {{lang|grc|Ἄπλουν}}, {{transliteration|grc|Aploun}}; {{lang-la|Apollō}})

The name ''Apollo''—unlike the related [[List of Mycenaean deities|older name]] ''[[Paean (god)|Paean]]''—is generally not found in the [[Linear B]] ([[Mycenean Greek]]) texts, although there is a possible attestation in the [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunose]] form '']pe-rjo-['' (Linear B: ]{{lang|gmy|{{script|Linb|𐀟𐁊}}}}-[) on the [[Knossos|KN]] E 842 tablet,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S.

The [[etymology]] of the name is uncertain. The spelling {{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων}} ({{IPA-el|a.pól.lɔːn|pron}} in [[Attic Greek|Classical Attic]]) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the [[common era]], but the [[Dorians|Doric]] form, {{transliteration|grc|Apellon}} ({{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}), is more archaic, as it is derived from an earlier {{lang|grc|*Ἀπέλjων}}. It probably is a cognate to the Doric month ''Apellaios'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀπελλαῖος}}),&lt;ref name="DDD"&gt;{{cite book |last1=van der Toorn |first1=Karel |last2=Becking |first2=Bob |last3=van der Horst |first3=Pieter Willem |title=Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHgUAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA73 |year=1999 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-11119-6 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the offerings {{transliteration|grc|[[apellaia]]}} ({{lang|grc|ἀπελλαῖα}}) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival {{transliteration|grc|apellai}} ({{lang|grc|ἀπέλλαι}}).&lt;ref&gt;"The young men became grown-up {{transliteration|grc|[[kouros|kouroi]]}}, and Apollon was the {{transliteration|grc|megistos kouros}} (The Great Kouros) : Jane Ellen Harrison (2010): ''Themis: A study to the Social origins of Greek Religion'' Cambridge University Press. pp. 439–441, {{ISBN|1108009492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leiden |first1=E.

Nilsson, Vol I, p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apella]] ({{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλα}}) is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta,&lt;ref name=Nilsson556/&gt; corresponding to the {{transliteration|grc|[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]]}} ({{lang|grc|ἐκκλησία}}). [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun {{transliteration|grc|apellai}} and suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] proto-form *''Apal&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;un''.&lt;ref&gt;Beekes, 2009, pp. 115, 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several instances of [[popular etymology]] are attested from ancient authors. Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb {{lang|grc|ἀπόλλυμι}} ({{transliteration|grc|apollymi}}), "to destroy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike |last=Campbell |url=http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=apollo |title=Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Apollo |publisher=Behind the Name |access-date=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] in ''[[Cratylus]]'' connects the name with {{lang|grc|ἀπόλυσις}} ({{transliteration|grc| apolysis}}), "redemption", with {{lang|grc|ἀπόλουσις}} (''apolousis''), "purification", and with {{lang|grc|ἁπλοῦν}} ({{transliteration|grc|[h]aploun}}), "simple",&lt;ref&gt;The {{lang|grc|ἁπλοῦν}} suggestion is repeated by [[Plutarch]] in ''[[Moralia]]'' in the sense of "[[1 (number)|unity]]".&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, {{lang|grc|Ἄπλουν}}, and finally with {{lang|grc|Ἀειβάλλων}} ({{transliteration|grc|aeiballon}}), "ever-shooting". [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] connects the name Apollo with the Doric {{lang|grc|ἀπέλλα}} ({{transliteration|grc|apella}}), which means "assembly", so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation {{lang|grc|σηκός}} ({{transliteration|grc|sekos}}), "fold", in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=184}} In the [[ancient Macedonian language]] {{lang|grc|πέλλα}} ({{transliteration|grc|pella}}) means "stone,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1168.&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[toponyms]] may be derived from this word: {{lang|grc|Πέλλα}} ([[Pella]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pe/lla|πέλλα|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the capital of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|ancient Macedonia]]) and {{lang|grc|Πελλήνη}} (''Pellēnē''/''[[Pellene]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson Vol I, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hittite language|Hittite]] form ''[[Apaliunas]]'' (''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;''{{lang|hit-Latn|x-ap-pa-li-u-na-aš}}) is attested in the [[Manapa-Tarhunta letter]].&lt;ref&gt;The reading of ''Apaliunas'' and the possible identification with Apollo is due to [[Emil Forrer]] (1931). It was doubted by [[Paul Kretschmer|Kretschmer]], ''Glotta'' XXIV, p. 250. Martin Nilsson (1967), Vol I, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hittite language|Hittite]] testimony reflects an early form ''{{lang|grc-Latn|*Apeljōn}}'', which may also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot {{lang|grc|Ἀπείλων}} with Doric {{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Angel |first1=John L. |last2=Mellink |first2=Machteld Johanna | title = Troy and the Trojan War: A Symposium Held at Bryn Mawr College, October 1984| year = 1986| publisher = Bryn Mawr Commentaries| isbn = 978-0-929524-59-7| page = 42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the Lydian god ''Qλdãns'' /kʷʎðãns/ may reflect an earlier /kʷalyán-/ before palatalization, syncope, and the pre-Lydian sound change *y ''&gt;'' d.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgQowuFZeLUC&amp;pg=PA338|title=Anatolian Historical Phonology|last=Melchert|first=Harold Craig|date=1994|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-9051836974|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note the labiovelar in place of the labial /p/ found in pre-Doric ''Ἀπέλjων'' and Hittite ''Apaliunas''.

A [[Luwian language|Luwian]] etymology suggested for ''Apaliunas'' makes Apollo "The One of Entrapment", perhaps in the sense of "Hunter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Immerwahr |first1=Sara Anderson |last2=Chapin |first2=Anne Proctor | title = Charis: Essays in Honor of Sara A.

===Greco-Roman epithets===
Apollo's chief [[epithet]] was '''Phoebus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|b|ə|s}} {{respell|FEE|bəs}}; {{lang|grc|Φοῖβος}}, ''Phoibos'' {{IPA-el|pʰó͜i.bos}}), literally "bright".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1582.&lt;/ref&gt; It was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans for Apollo's role as the god of light. Like other Greek deities, he had a number of others applied to him, reflecting the variety of roles, duties, and aspects ascribed to the god. However, while Apollo has a great number of appellations in Greek myth, only a few occur in [[Latin literature]].

===Celtic epithets and cult titles===
Apollo was worshipped throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. In the traditionally [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] lands, he was most often seen as a healing and sun god. He was often equated with [[List of Celtic gods|Celtic gods]] of similar character.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda J. Green, ''Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend'', Thames and Hudson Ltd, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Apollo Atepomarus]]''' ("the great horseman" or "possessing a great horse"). Apollo was worshipped at [[Mauvières]] ([[Indre]]). Horses were, in the Celtic world, closely linked to the sun.&lt;ref&gt;''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' XIII, 1863–1986; A. Ross, ''Pagan Celtic Britain'', 1967; M.J.

==Origins==
[[File:Omphalos museum.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Omphalos]] in the Museum of [[Delphi]]]]
The cult centers of Apollo in Greece, [[Delphi]] and [[Delos]], date from the 8th century BCE. The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to [[Artemis]], Apollo's twin sister. At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of the monstrous serpent [[Python (mythology)|Python]]. For the Greeks, Apollo was the most Greek of all the gods, and through the centuries he acquired different functions. In [[Archaic Greece]] he was the [[prophet]], the oracular god who in older times was connected with "healing". In [[Classical Greece]] he was the god of light and of music, but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). "Die Geschicte der Giechischen Religion, Vol I." C.F.Beck Verlag.Munchen. p. 529&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Burkert]] discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship, which he termed "a Dorian-northwest Greek component, a Cretan-Minoan component, and a Syro-Hittite component."&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, Walter. ''Greek Religion'', 1985:144.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healer and god-protector from evil===
[[File:Apollo-WaltersArt.jpg|left|thumb|upright=.9|''Apollo Victorious over the Python'' by [[Pietro Francavilla]] (1591) depicting Apollo's victory over the serpent Python&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo Victorious over the Python|url=http://art.thewalters.org/detail/7866|access-date=21 June 2013|publisher=[[The Walters Art Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Walters Art Museum|The Walters Art Museum]]).]]
In classical times, his major function in popular religion was to keep away evil, and he was therefore called "apotropaios" ({{lang|grc|ἀποτρόπαιος}}, "averting evil") and "alexikakos" ({{lang|grc|ἀλεξίκακος}} "keeping off ill"; from [[verb|v.]] {{lang|grc|ἀλέξω}} + [[noun|n.]] {{lang|grc|κακόν}}).&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias VIII 41, 8-IV 34, 7-Sittig. Nom P. 48. f-Aristoph. Vesp. V. 61-Paus. I 3, 4. Martin Nilsson (1967) Vol I, pp. 540, 544&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo also had many epithets relating to his function as a healer. Some commonly-used examples are "paion" ({{lang|grc|παιών}} literally "healer" or "helper")&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0062:entry=paean-harpers]: Harper's Dictionary of classical antiquity&lt;/ref&gt; "epikourios" ({{lang|grc|ἐπικούριος}}, "succouring"), "oulios" ({{lang|grc|οὔλιος}}, "healer, baleful")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ou)/lios|οὔλιος|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and "loimios" ({{lang|grc|λοίμιος}}, "of the plague"). In later writers, the word, "paion", usually spelled "Paean", becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of [[healing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graf|first=Fritz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=it9n9_I-UOkC&amp;pg=PA66|title=Apollo|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2008|isbn=978-0-203-58171-1|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo in his aspect of "healer" has a connection to the primitive god [[Paean (god)|Paean]] ({{lang|grc|Παιών-Παιήων}}), who did not have a cult of his own. Paean serves as the healer of the gods in the ''[[Iliad]]'', and seems to have originated in a pre-Greek religion.&lt;ref&gt;Paieon ({{lang|grc|Παιήων}}) puts pain-relieving medicines on the wounds of Pluton and Ares ( [[Iliad|Ilias]] E401). This art is related with Egypt: ([[Odyssey]] D232): M. Nilsson Vol I, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested, though unconfirmed, that he is connected to the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] figure ''pa-ja-wo-ne'' (Linear B: {{lang|gmy|𐀞𐀊𐀺𐀚}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mycenaeans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXwzT1048Z4C&amp;pg=PA160|page=160|first=Louise|last=Schofield|year=2007|publisher=The British Museum Press|isbn=978-0-89236-867-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minoan.deaditerranean.com/linear-b-transliterations/knossos/kn-v/kn-v/#toc-kn-v-52|title=KN V 52+|website=Deaditerranean: Minoan Linear A &amp; Mycenaean Linear B|access-date=17 March 2014|archive-date=18 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318004206/http://minoan.deaditerranean.com/linear-b-transliterations/knossos/kn-v/kn-v/#toc-kn-v-52|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chawick"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=John|author-link=John Chadwick|title=The Mycenaean World|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1976|isbn=978-0-521-29037-1|url=https://archive.org/details/mycenaeanworld00chad|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/mycenaeanworld00chad/page/89 89]}} At Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Paean was the personification of holy songs sung by "seer-doctors" ({{lang|grc|ἰατρομάντεις}}), which were supposed to cure disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|Ἐπὶ καταπαύσει λοιμῶν καὶ νόσων ᾄδόμενος}}. ''Which is sung to stop the plagues and the diseases''. Proklos: Chrestom from Photios Bibl. code. 239, p. 321: Martin Nilsson. Die Geschicthe der Griechischen religion. Vol I, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt;

Homer illustrated Paeon the god and the song both of [[apotropaic]] thanksgiving or triumph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Homer|first=750? BCE-650? BCE|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2199|title=The Iliad|date=2000-06-01|language=en|translator-last=Butler|translator-first=Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo and afterwards to other gods: to [[Dionysus]], to Apollo [[Helios]], to Apollo's son [[Asclepius]] the healer. About the 4th century BCE, the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. It was in this way that Apollo had become recognized as the god of music. Apollo's role as the slayer of the [[Python (mythology)|Python]] led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.

In the ''Iliad'', Apollo is the healer under the gods, but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows, similar to the function of the [[Vedic]] god of disease [[Rudra]].&lt;ref name="Martin Nilsson 1967 p. 541"&gt;"The conception that the diseases come from invisible shots sent by magicians or supernatural beings is common in primitive people and also in European folklore. In North-Europe they speak of the "[[Elf-shot]]s". In Sweden where the Lapps were called magicians, they speak of the "Lappen-shots". Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt; He sends a plague ({{lang|grc|λοιμός}}) to the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]]. Knowing that Apollo can prevent a recurrence of the plague he sent, they purify themselves in a ritual and offer him a large sacrifice of cows, called a [[hecatomb]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad|Ilias]] A 314. Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dorian origin===
The ''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Apollo]]'' depicts Apollo as an intruder from the north.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W. Park (1956). ''The delphic oracle''. Vol.I, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The connection with the northern-dwelling [[Dorians]] and their initiation festival ''[[apellai]]'' is reinforced by the month ''Apellaios'' in northwest Greek calendars.&lt;ref&gt;Graf, ''Apollo'', pp. 104–113; Burkert also notes in this context [[Archilochus]] ''Fr''. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The family-festival was dedicated to Apollo ([[Dorians|Doric]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀπέλλων}}).&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=sxurBtx6shoC&amp;pg=PA255 p. 255].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apellaios'' is the month of these rites, and Apellon is the "megistos kouros" (the great Kouros).&lt;ref&gt;Jane Ellen Harrison (2010): ''Themis: A study to the Social origins of Greek Religion''. Cambridge University Press. p. 441. {{ISBN|1108009492}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it can explain only the Doric type of the name, which is connected with the [[Ancient Macedonian language|Ancient Macedonian]] word "pella" ([[Pella]]), ''stone''. Stones played an important part in the cult of the god, especially in the oracular shrine of Delphi ([[Omphalos]]).&lt;ref&gt;Compare: [[Baetylus]]. In Semitic: sacred stone&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I. p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minoan origin===
[[File:AMI - Goldene Doppelaxt.jpg|thumb|250px|Ornamented golden [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[labrys]]]]
George Huxley regarded the identification of Apollo with the Minoan deity Paiawon, worshipped in Crete, to have originated at Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huxley|first=George|date=1975-06-06|title=Cretan Paiawones|url=https://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/view/8541|journal=Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=119–124|issn=2159-3159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Homeric Hymn'', Apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried Cretan priests to Delphi, where they evidently transferred their religious practices. ''Apollo Delphinios'' or ''Delphidios'' was a sea-god especially worshipped in Crete and in the islands.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol&amp;nbsp;I, p.&amp;nbsp;554 A4&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's sister [[Artemis]], who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with [[Britomartis]] (Diktynna), the Minoan "Mistress of the animals". In her earliest depictions she was accompanied by the "Master of the animals", a bow-wielding god of hunting whose name has been lost; aspects of this figure may have been absorbed into the more popular Apollo.&lt;ref name="Nilsson499"&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967), Vol I, pp. 499–500&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anatolian origin===
[[File:Coin of Apollo Agyieus.png|thumb|250px|Illustration of a coin of Apollo Agyieus from [[Ambracia]]]]
A non-Greek origin of Apollo has long been assumed in scholarship.&lt;ref name="DDD"/&gt; The name of Apollo's mother [[Leto]] has [[Lydia]]n origin, and she was worshipped on the coasts of [[Asia Minor]]. The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from [[Anatolia]], which is the origin of [[Sibyl]], and where some of the oldest oracular shrines originated. Omens, symbols, purifications, and exorcisms appear in old [[Assyria|Assyro]]-[[Babylon]]ian texts. These rituals were spread into the empire of the [[Hittites]], and from there into Greece.&lt;ref name="Nilsson563"&gt;[[Martin P. Nilsson|Martin Nilsson]]. ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion Vol I'', pp. 563–564&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Homer]] pictures Apollo on the side of the [[Troy|Trojans]], fighting against the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]], during the [[Trojan War]]. He is pictured as a terrible god, less trusted by the Greeks than other gods. The god seems to be related to ''Appaliunas'', a tutelary god of [[Wilusa]] ([[Troy]]) in Asia Minor, but the word is not complete.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kretschmer]] (1936). Glotta XXIV p. 250. Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 559.&lt;/ref&gt; The stones found in front of the gates of [[Homer]]ic Troy were the symbols of Apollo. A western Anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of ''Artimus'' ([[Artemis]]) and ''Qλdãns'', whose name may be cognate with the Hittite and Doric forms, in surviving [[Lydian language|Lydian]] texts''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ediana.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/corpus.php|title=EDIANA - Corpus|website=www.ediana.gwi.uni-muenchen.de|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent scholars have cast doubt on the identification of ''Qλdãns'' with Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sardisexpedition.org/en/essays/latw-greenewalt-gods-of-lydia|title=The Archaeological Exploration of Sardis|website=sardisexpedition.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks gave to him the name {{lang|grc|ἀγυιεύς}} ''[[agyieus]]'' as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson, ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion.'' vol. I (C. H. Beck), 1955:563f.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the [[full moon]], all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day (''sibutu'') indicates a [[Babylonia]]n origin.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Late Bronze Age]] (from 1700 to 1200 BCE) [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Hurrian]] ''Aplu'' was a god of [[Plague (disease)|plague]], invoked during plague years. Here we have an [[apotrope|apotropaic]] situation, where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it. Aplu, meaning ''the son of'', was a title given to the god [[Nergal]], who was linked to the Babylonian god of the sun [[Shamash]].&lt;ref name="Grummond"&gt;de Grummond, Nancy Thomson (2006) ''Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend''.

(2005) ''Myths of Babylonia and Assyria'' (Gutenberg)&lt;/ref&gt; Homer interprets Apollo as a terrible god ({{lang|grc|δεινὸς θεός}}) who brings death and disease with his arrows, but who can also heal, possessing a magic art that separates him from the other Greek gods.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967).

The [[Vedic]] [[Rudra]] has some similar functions with Apollo. The terrible god is called "the archer" and the bow is also an attribute of [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;For {{IAST|Śarva}} as a name of Shiva see: Apte, p.&amp;nbsp;910.&lt;/ref&gt; Rudra could bring diseases with his arrows, but he was able to free people of them and his alternative Shiva is a healer physician god.&lt;ref&gt;For association between Rudra and disease, with Rigvedic references, see: Bhandarkar, p.&amp;nbsp;146.&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] component of Apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens, exorcisms, and with the oracular cult.

==Oracular cult==

[[File:Herakles tripod Louvre F341.jpg|thumb|250px|Oracular tripod.]] 
Unusually among the Olympic deities, Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence: [[Delos]] and [[Delphi]]. In cult practice, [[Delos|Delian Apollo]] and [[Pythian Apollo]] (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1985:143.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lycia]] was sacred to the god, for this Apollo was also called Lycian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/133#5.77.5 Diodorus Siculus, Library 1-7, 5.77.5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0060.tlg001.perseus-grc1:5.77 Diodorus Siculus, Library 1-7, 5.77.5 - GR]&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's [[Cult (religion)|cult]] was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE. Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]], and the frequency of [[theophoric names]] such as ''Apollodorus'' or ''Apollonios'' and cities named ''Apollonia'' testify to his popularity. Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites. In the 2nd and 3rd century CE, those at [[Didyma]] and [[Claros]] pronounced the so-called "theological oracles", in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an [[Monism#Monism, pantheism, and panentheism|all-encompassing, highest deity]]. "In the 3rd century, Apollo fell silent. [[Julian the Apostate]] (359–361) tried to revive the Delphic oracle, but failed."&lt;ref name="DDD"/&gt;

===Oracular shrines===
[[File:Delos lions.jpg|thumb|250px|Delos lions]]
Apollo had a famous [[oracle]] in Delphi, and other notable ones in [[Claros]] and [[Didyma]]. His oracular shrine in [[Abae]] in [[Phocis]], where he bore the [[toponym]]ic epithet ''[[Abaeus]]'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀπόλλων Ἀβαῖος}}, ''Apollon Abaios''), was important enough to be consulted by [[Croesus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], 1.46.&lt;/ref&gt;
His oracular shrines include:

* [[Abae]] in [[Phocis]].
* [[Bassae]] in the [[Peloponnese]].
* At [[Clarus]], on the west coast of [[Asia Minor]]; as at Delphi a holy spring which gave off a ''pneuma'', from which the priests drank.
* In [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], the Oracle of Corinth came from the town of [[Tenea]], from prisoners supposedly taken in the Trojan War.
* At [[Khyrse]], in [[Troad]], the temple was built for Apollo Smintheus.
* In [[Delos]], there was an oracle to the Delian Apollo, during summer. The Hieron (Sanctuary) of Apollo adjacent to the Sacred Lake, was the place where the god was said to have been born.
* In [[Delphi]], the [[Pythia]] became filled with the ''[[pneuma]]'' of Apollo, said to come from a spring inside the [[Adyton]].
* In [[Didyma]], an oracle on the coast of [[Anatolia]], south west of [[Lydia]]n ([[Luwian]]) [[Sardis]], in which priests from the lineage of the Branchidae received inspiration by drinking from a healing spring located in the temple. Was believed to have been founded by [[Branchus]], son or lover of Apollo.
* In [[Manbij|Hierapolis Bambyce]], Syria (modern Manbij), according to the treatise ''[[De Dea Syria]]'', the sanctuary of the [[Atargatis|Syrian Goddess]] contained a robed and bearded image of Apollo. Divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian]] (attrib.), ''[[De Dea Syria]]'' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/tsg/tsg07.htm#35 35–37].&lt;/ref&gt;
* At [[Patara (Lycia)|Patara]], in [[Lycia]], there was a seasonal winter oracle of Apollo, said to have been the place where the god went from Delos. As at Delphi the oracle at Patara was a woman.
* In [[Segesta]] in Sicily.

Oracles were also given by sons of Apollo.
* In [[Oropus]], north of [[Athens]], the oracle [[Amphiaraus]], was said to be the son of Apollo; Oropus also had a sacred spring.
* in Labadea, {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of Delphi, [[Trophonius]], another son of Apollo, killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle.

==Temples of Apollo==
{{Main|Ancient Greek temple|Roman temple}}

Many temples were dedicated to Apollo in Greece and the Greek colonies. They show the spread of the cult of Apollo and the evolution of the Greek architecture, which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations. Some of the earliest temples, especially in [[Crete]], do not belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures. The different wooden elements were considered [[divinity|divine]], and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of [[Doric order]]. The Greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances. The temples should be [[Canon (basic principle)|canonic]], and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection.&lt;ref&gt;To know what a thing is, we must know the look of it": Rhys Carpenter: ''The esthetic basis of Greek art''. Indiana University Press. p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings. The first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms. This probably influenced the theory of numbers of [[Pythagoras]], who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics.&lt;ref name="C. M. Bowra 1957 p. 166"&gt;C. M. Bowra (1957). ''The Greek experience'', p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Doric order]] dominated during the 6th and the 5th century BC but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs, which couldn't be solved without changing the original forms. The order was almost abandoned for the [[Ionic order]], but the Ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple. Both orders were abandoned for the [[Corinthian order]] gradually during the Hellenistic age and under Rome.

The most important temples are:

===Greek temples===
*[[Thebes, Greece]]: The oldest temple probably dedicated to ''Apollo Ismenius'' was built in the 9th century B.C. It seems that it was a curvilinear building. The [[Doric order|Doric]] temple was built in the early 7th century B.C., but only some small parts have been found&lt;ref&gt;William Dinsmoor (1950),''The architecture of Ancient Greece'', p. 218, {{ISBN|0-8196-0283-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A festival called [[Daphnephoria]] was celebrated every ninth year in honour of Apollo Ismenius (or Galaxius). The people held laurel branches (daphnai), and at the head of the procession walked a youth (chosen priest of Apollo), who was called "daphnephoros".&lt;ref name="William Smith 1875. p. 384"&gt;William Smith.'' A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', John Murray, London, 1875. p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Eretria]]: According to the Homeric hymn to Apollo, the god arrived to the plain, seeking for a location to establish its oracle. The first temple of ''Apollo Daphnephoros'', "Apollo, laurel-bearer", or "carrying off Daphne", is dated to 800 B.C. The temple was curvilinear ''hecatombedon'' (a hundred feet). In a smaller building were kept the bases of the laurel branches which were used for the first building. Another temple probably peripteral was built in the 7th century B.C., with an inner row of wooden columns over its Geometric predecessor. It was rebuilt peripteral around 510 B.C., with the [[stylobate]] measuring 21,00 x 43,00 m. The number of [[pteron]] column was 6 x 14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/eh251.jsp?obj_id=1689 Hellenic Ministry of culture, Temple of Apollo Daphnephoros] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912212901/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/eh251.jsp?obj_id=1689 |date=12 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rufus B.

*[[Dreros]] ([[Crete]]). The temple of ''Apollo Delphinios'' dates from the 7th century B.C., or probably from the middle of the 8th century B.C. According to the legend, Apollo appeared as a dolphin, and carried Cretan priests to the port of [[Delphi]].&lt;ref name="Martin Nilsson 1967 p. 529"&gt;Martin Nilsson (1967). Vol&amp;nbsp;I, p.&amp;nbsp;529&lt;/ref&gt; The dimensions of the plan are 10,70 x 24,00 m and the building was not peripteral. It contains column-bases of the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] type, which may be considered as the predecessors of the [[Doric order|Doric]] columns.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=l3Ln6KMGio0C&amp;pg=PA56 56], [https://books.google.com/books?id=l3Ln6KMGio0C&amp;pg=PA323 323].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gortyn]] ([[Crete]]). A temple of ''Pythian Apollo'', was built in the 7th century B.C. The plan measured 19,00 x 16,70 m and it was not peripteral. The walls were solid, made from limestone, and there was single door on the east side.
*[[Thermon]] ([[West Greece]]): The [[Doric order|Doric]] temple of ''Apollo Thermios'', was built in the middle of the 7th century B.C. It was built on an older curvilinear building dating perhaps from the 10th century B.C., on which a [[peristyle]] was added. The temple was narrow, and the number of pteron columns (probably wooden) was 5 x 15. There was a single row of inner columns. It measures 12.13 x 38.23 m at the stylobate, which was made from stones.&lt;ref name="Spivey, p. 112"&gt;Spivey, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Apollotempel.gif|thumb|left|200px| Floor plan of the temple of Apollo, Corinth]] 
*[[Corinth]]: A [[Doric order|Doric]] temple was built in the 6th century B.C. The temple's [[stylobate]] measures 21.36 x 53.30 m, and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 15. There was a double row of inner columns. The style is similar with the Temple of Alcmeonidae at [[Delphi]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The Corinthians were considered to be the inventors of the [[Doric order]].&lt;ref name="Spivey, p. 112"/&gt; 
*Napes ([[Lesbos]]): An [[Aeolic order|Aeolic]] temple probably of ''Apollo Napaios'' was built in the 7th century B.C. Some special capitals with floral ornament have been found, which are called [[Aeolic order|Aeolic]], and it seems that they were borrowed from the East.&lt;ref name=Robertson324&gt;D.S Robertson(1945):''A handbook of Greek and Roman architecture'', Cambridge University Press pp. 324-329&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Cyrene, Libya]]: The oldest [[Doric order|Doric]] temple of Apollo was built in {{circa|600 B.C.}}. The number of pteron columns was 6 x 11, and it measures 16.75 x 30.05 m at the stylobate. There was a double row of sixteen inner columns on stylobates. The capitals were made from stone.&lt;ref name=Robertson324/&gt; 
*[[Naukratis]]: An [[Ionic order|Ionic]] temple was built in the early 6th century B.C. Only some fragments have been found and the earlier, made from limestone, are identified among the oldest of the [[Ionic order]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Siracusa-Temple-of-Apoll-Plan-bjs.png|thumb|right|200px|Floor plan of the temple of Apollo, Syracuse]]
*[[Syracuse, Sicily]]: A [[Doric order|Doric]] temple was built at the beginning of the 6th century B.C. The temple's [[stylobate]] measures 21.47 x 55.36 m and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 17. It was the first temple in Greek west built completely out of stone. A second row of columns were added, obtaining the effect of an inner porch.&lt;ref&gt;Mertens 2006, pp. 104–109.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Selinus]] ([[Sicily]]):The [[Doric order|Doric]] [[Temple C (Selinus)|Temple C]] dates from 550 B.C., and it was probably dedicated to Apollo. The temple's stylobate measures 10.48 x 41.63 m and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 17. There was portico with a second row of columns, which is also attested for the temple at [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Inscriptiones Graecorum|IG]] XIV 269&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Delphi]]: The first temple dedicated to Apollo, was built in the 7th century B.C. According to the legend, it was wooden made of laurel branches. The "Temple of Alcmeonidae" was built in {{circa|513 B.C.}}  and it is the oldest Doric temple with significant marble elements. The temple's stylobate measures 21.65 x 58.00 m, and the number of pteron columns as 6 x 15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/delphi-temple-of-apollo.html Temple of Apollo at Delphi], Ancient-Greece.org&lt;/ref&gt; A fest similar with Apollo's fest at [[Thebes, Greece]] was celebrated every nine years. A boy was sent to the temple, who walked on the sacred road and returned carrying a laurel branch (''dopnephoros''). The maidens participated with joyful songs.&lt;ref name="William Smith 1875. p. 384"/&gt; 
*[[Chios]]: An [[Ionic order|Ionic]] temple of ''Apollo Phanaios'' was built at the end of the 6th century B.C. Only some small parts have been found and the capitals had floral ornament.&lt;ref name=Robertson324/&gt; 
*[[Abae]] ([[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocis]]). The temple was destroyed by the [[Persia]]ns in the invasion of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] in 480 B.C., and later by the [[Boeotia]]ns. It was rebuilt by [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=William|title=New classical dictionary of biography, mythology, and geography|publisher=J.

[[File:Bassai Temple of Apollo Plan.svg|left|thumb|200px|Floor plan of the Temple of Apollo at Bassae]] 
*[[Bassae]] ([[Peloponnesus]]):A temple dedicated to ''Apollo Epikourios'' ("Apollo the helper"), was built in 430 B.C. and it was designed by [[Iktinos]].It combined [[Doric order|Doric]] and [[Ionic order|Ionic]] elements, and the earliest use of column with a [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capital in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=6664 Hellenic Ministry of Culture: The Temple of Epicurean Apollo].&lt;/ref&gt; The temple is of a relatively modest size, with the [[stylobate]] measuring 14.5 x 38.3 metres&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;[http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/apolloepicurius.html Temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231045240/http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/apolloepicurius.html |date=31 December 2006 }}, World Heritage Site.&lt;/ref&gt; containing a [[Doric order|Doric]] [[peristyle]] of 6 x 15 columns. The roof left a central space open to admit light and air.
*[[Delos]]: A temple probably dedicated to Apollo and not peripteral, was built in the late 7th century B.C., with a plan measuring 10,00 x 15,60 m. The [[Doric order|Doric]] Great temple of Apollo, was built in {{circa|475 B.C.}}. The temple's stylobate measures 13.72 x 29.78 m, and the number of pteron columns as 6 x 13. Marble was extensively used.&lt;ref name=Robertson324/&gt;
*[[Ambracia]]: A [[Doric order|Doric]] peripteral temple dedicated to ''Apollo Pythios Sotir'' was built in 500 B.C., and It is lying at the centre of the Greek city [[Arta, Greece|Arta]]. Only some parts have been found, and it seems that the temple was built on earlier sanctuaries dedicated to Apollo. The temple measures 20,75 x 44,00 m at the [[stylobate]].

[[File:Tempel des Apollo Didymaeos in Milet.png|right|thumb|180px|Temple of Apollo, Didyma]]
*[[Didyma]] (near [[Miletus]]): The gigantic [[Ionic order|Ionic]] temple of ''Apollo Didymaios'' started around 540 B.C. The construction ceased and then it was restarted in 330 B.C. The temple is dipteral, with an outer row of 10 x 21 columns, and it measures 28.90 x 80.75 m at the stylobate.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schneider: ''Neue Funde vom archaischen Apollontempel in Didyma''.

*[[Clarus]] (near ancient [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]]): According to the legend, the famous seer Calchas, on his return from Troy, came to Clarus. He challenged the seer Mopsus, and died when he lost.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1873, [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=clarus-geo s.v. Clarus].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Doric order|Doric]] temple of ''Apollo Clarius'' was probably built in the 3rd century B.C., and it was peripteral with 6 x 11 columns. It was reconstructed at the end of the Hellenistic period, and later from the emperor [[Hadrian]] but Pausanias claims that it was still incomplete in the 2nd century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20140917093750/http://www.klaros.org/apollon-klarios-tapinagi-ve-sunaklari?lang=en Prophecy centre of Apollo Clarius]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hamaxitus]] ([[Troad]]): In [[Iliad]], [[Chryses]] the priest of Apollo, addresses the god with the epithet Smintheus (Lord of Mice), related with the god's ancient role as bringer of the disease (plague). Recent excavations indicate that the Hellenistic temple of ''Apollo Smintheus'' was constructed at 150–125 B.C., but the symbol of the mouse god was used on coinage probably from the 4th century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Bresson (2007) 154-5, citing the excavations reports of Özgünel (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The temple measures 40,00 x 23,00 m at the [[stylobate]], and the number of pteron columns was 8 x 14.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pythion ({{lang-grc|Πύθιον}}), this was the name of a shrine of Apollo at [[Athens]] near the [[Ilisos]] river.

===Etruscan and Roman temples===
*[[Veii]] ([[Etruria]]): The temple of Apollo was built in the late 6th century B.C. and it indicates the spread of Apollo's culture (Aplu) in Etruria. There was a prostyle porch, which is called [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], and a triple cella 18,50 m wide.&lt;ref name="Robertson pp. 200-201"&gt;Robertson pp. 200-201&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Falerii Veteres]] ([[Etruria]]): A temple of Apollo was built probably in the 4th-3rd century B.C. Parts of a teraccotta capital, and a teraccotta base have been found. It seems that the Etruscan columns were derived from the archaic Doric.&lt;ref name="Robertson pp. 200-201"/&gt; A cult of [[Soranus (mythology)|Apollo Soranus]] is attested by one inscription found near Falerii.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0006:entry=falerii-veteres Perseus tufts: Falerii Veteres]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Pompeii]] (Italy): The cult of Apollo was widespread in the region of Campania since the 6th century B.C. The temple was built in 120 B.C., but its beginnings lie in the 6th century B.C. It was reconstructed after an earthquake in A.D. 63. It demonstrates a mixing of styles which formed the basis of Roman architecture. The columns in front of the cella formed a [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] prostyle porch, and the cella is situated unusually far back. The peripteral colonnade of 48 [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns was placed in such a way that the emphasis was given to the front side.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson CSA :[http://sites.davidson.edu/csa/the-temple-of-apollo-at-pompeii-a-mishmash-of-architecture/ Temple of Apollo, Pompeii] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106221543/http://sites.davidson.edu/csa/the-temple-of-apollo-at-pompeii-a-mishmash-of-architecture/ |date=6 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rome: The [[temple of Apollo Sosianus]] and the ''temple of Apollo Medicus''. The first temple building dates to 431 B.C., and was dedicated to Apollo Medicus (the doctor), after a plague of 433 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/livy/liv.4.shtml#25 Livy 4.25]&lt;/ref&gt; It was rebuilt by [[Gaius Sosius]], probably in 34 B.C. Only three columns with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capitals exist today. It seems that the cult of Apollo had existed in this area since at least to the mid-5th century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/livy/liv.34.shtml#43 Livy 34.43]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rome:The [[temple of Apollo Palatinus]] was located on the Palatine hill within the sacred boundary of the city. It was dedicated by [[Augustus]] on 28 B.C. The façade of the original temple was [[Ionic order|Ionic]] and it was constructed from solid blocks of marble. Many famous statues by Greek masters were on display in and around the temple, including a marble statue of the god at the entrance and a statue of Apollo in the cella.&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Aedes_Apollinis_Palatini.html A topographical dictionary of Ancient Rome]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
{{Main|Greek mythology}}
Apollo appears often in the myths, plays and hymns. As Zeus' favorite son, Apollo had direct access to the mind of Zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans. A divinity beyond human comprehension, he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god.

===Birth===
[[File:Latona with Her Children Apollo and Diana LACMA M.78.86.jpg|thumb|Leto holding Apollo, by Lazar Widmann|left]]
[[File:Metropolitan Richart Latona.jpg|thumb|Leto with her children, by [[William Henry Rinehart]]]]

Apollo was the son of Zeus, the king of the gods, and Leto, his previous wife&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D21%3Acard%3D468 21.499]&lt;/ref&gt; or one of his mistresses. Growing up, Apollo was nursed by the nymphs Korythalia and [[Aletheia (disambiguation)|Aletheia]], the personification of truth.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Moralia'' 657e&lt;/ref&gt;

When Zeus' wife [[Hera]] discovered that [[Leto]] was pregnant, she banned Leto from giving birth on ''[[Solid Earth|terra firma]]''. Leto sought shelter in many lands, only to be rejected by them. Finally, the voice of unborn Apollo informed his mother about a floating island named [[Delos]] that had once been [[Asteria (Titaness)|Asteria]], Leto's own sister.&lt;ref name="Callimachus, Hymn to Delos"&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Delos''&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was neither a mainland nor an island, Leto was readily welcomed there and gave birth to her children under a palm tree. All the goddesses except Hera were present to witness the event. It is also stated that Hera kidnapped [[Eileithyia]], the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor. The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace of amber 9 yards (8.2 m) long.&lt;ref name="Homeric hymn to Apollo"/&gt;

When Apollo was born, clutching a golden sword,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Works and Days|last=Hesiod|date=2007 |doi=10.4159/dlcl.hesiod-works_days.2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; everything on Delos turned into gold&lt;ref name="Callimachus, Hymn to Delos"/&gt; and the island was filled with ambrosial fragrance.&lt;ref&gt;Theognis, Fragment 1. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Swans circled the island seven times and the nymphs sang in delight.&lt;ref name="Callimachus, Hymn to Delos"/&gt; He was washed clean by the goddesses who then covered him in white garment and fastened golden bands around him. Since Leto was unable to feed him, [[Themis]], the goddess of divine law, fed him with nectar, or [[ambrosia]]. Upon tasting the divine food, Apollo broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that he would be the master of [[lyre]] and archery, and interpret the will of Zeus to humankind.&lt;ref name="Homeric hymn to Apollo"&gt;Homer, ''Hymn to Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt; Zeus, who had calmed Hera by then, came and adorned his son with a golden headband.&lt;ref&gt;Alcaeus, ''Hymn to Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Himerius, ''Oration''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Latona with the infants Apollo and Artemis, by Francesco Pozzi, 1824, marble - Sculpture Gallery, Chatsworth House - Derbyshire, England - DSC03504.jpg|thumb|Leto with Apollo and Artemis, by [[Francesco Pozzi]]]]

Apollo's birth fixed the floating Delos to the earth.&lt;ref name="Homeric hymn to Apollo"/&gt; Leto promised that her son would be always favorable towards the Delians. According to some, Apollo secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean after some time.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'', [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0052%3Abook%3D3%3Acard%3D69 3.80]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca''&lt;/ref&gt; This island became sacred to Apollo and was one of the major cult centres of the god.

Apollo was born on the seventh day ({{lang|grc|ἑβδομαγενής}}, ''hebdomagenes'')&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|e(bdomagenh/s|ἑβδομαγενής|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the month [[Attic calendar#Festival calendar|Thargelion]]—according to Delian tradition—or of the month [[Hellenic calendars#Delphic|Bysios]]—according to Delphian tradition. The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=184}} Mythographers agree that [[Artemis]] was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of Apollo or was born on the island of [[Ortygia]] then helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo.

===Hyperborea===

[[Hyperborea]], the mystical land of eternal spring, venerated Apollo above all the gods. The Hyperboreans always sang and danced in his honor and hosted [[Pythian games]].&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, Pindar, Olympian Ode&lt;/ref&gt; There, a vast forest of beautiful trees was called "the garden of Apollo". Apollo spent the winter months among the Hyperboreans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''[[Argonautica]]'', [https://archive.org/details/argonautica00apoluoft/page/148/mode/2up?view=theater 2. 674].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; His absence from the world caused coldness and this was marked as his annual death. No prophecies were issued during this time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Joseph Eddy Fontenrose, ''Python: A Study of Delphic Myth and Its Origins''&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the world during the beginning of the spring. The ''Theophania'' festival was held in [[Delphi]] to celebrate his return.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''de his qui sero a num. pun.'' p. 557F&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that Leto came to Delos from Hyperborea accompanied by a pack of wolves. Henceforth, Hyperborea became Apollo's winter home and wolves became sacred to him. His intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet ''Lyceus'', meaning ''wolf-like''. But Apollo was also the wolf-slayer in his role as the god who protected flocks from predators. The Hyperborean worship of Apollo bears the strongest marks of Apollo being worshipped as the sun god. Shamanistic elements in Apollo's cult are often liked to his Hyperborean origin, and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Afonasina, ''Shamanism and the Orphic tradition''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Graf, ''Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt; Shamans like [[Abaris]] and [[Aristeas]] were also the followers of Apollo, who hailed from Hyperborea.

In myths, the tears of amber Apollo shed when his son Asclepius died became the waters of the river Eridanos, which surrounded Hyperborea. Apollo also buried in Hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the [[Cyclopes]]. He later gave this arrow to Abaris.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''[[Argonautica]]'', [https://archive.org/details/argonautica00apoluoft/page/334/mode/2up?view=theater 4. 594].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood and youth===

As a child, Apollo is said to have built a foundation and an altar on Delos using the horns of the goats that his sister Artemis hunted. Since he learnt the art of building when young, he later came to be known as [[Archegetes]], ''the founder (of towns)'' and god who guided men to build new cities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; From his father Zeus, Apollo had also received a golden chariot drawn by swans.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy P. Bridgman 
 ''Hyperboreans: Myth and History in Celtic-Hellenic Contacts''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Flaxman - To Phoebus at His Birth, From Aeschylus, Furies - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Phoebe (Titaness)|Phoebe]] gifts the oracular tripod to Apollo, by [[John Flaxman]]]]

In his early years when Apollo spent his time herding cows, he was reared by [[Thriae]], the bee nymphs, who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn]] 4 to [[Hermes]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0138%3Ahymn%3D4%3Acard%3D550 550].&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo is also said to have invented the lyre, and along with Artemis, the art of archery. He then taught to the humans the art of healing and archery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/5D*.html#74.5 5.74.5].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phoebe (Titaness)|Phoebe]], his grandmother, gave the oracular shrine of [[Delphi]] to Apollo as a birthday gift. Themis inspired him to be the oracular voice of Delphi thereon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0006 1]; ''[[Orphic Hymn]]'' 79 ''to Themis'' (Athanassakis and Wolkow, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTo3r8IHy0wC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Python====
[[File:7003.Apollo mit dem getöteten Python(1752)-François Gaspard Adam-Große Fontäne-Sanssouci Steffen Heilfort.JPG|thumb|190px|Apollo victorious over the Python, by [[François Gaspard Adam]]|left]]
[[File:Leto (Latona). - Engravings on Wood.jpg|thumb|Python pursuing Leto and her children, engravings on wood]]

[[Python (mythology)|Python]], a [[chthonic]] serpent-dragon, was a child of Gaia and the guardian of the [[Delphic Oracle]], whose death was foretold by Apollo when he was still in Leto's womb.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Python was the nurse of the giant [[Typhon]].&lt;ref name="Homeric hymn to Apollo"/&gt; In most of the traditions, Apollo was still a child when he killed Python.

Python was sent by Hera to hunt the pregnant Leto to death, and had assaulted her. To avenge the trouble given to his mother, Apollo went in search of Python and killed it in the sacred cave at Delphi with the bow and arrows that he had received from [[Hephaestus]]. The Delphian nymphs who were present encouraged Apollo during the battle with the cry "Hie [[Paean]]". After Apollo was victorious, they also brought him gifts and gave the [[Corycian cave]] to him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Children of the Gods'' by [[Kenneth McLeish]], p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Homer, Apollo had encountered and killed the Python when he was looking for a place to establish his shrine.

According to another version, when Leto was in Delphi, Python had attacked her. Apollo defended his mother and killed Python.&lt;ref&gt;Euripides Iphigenia in Tauris&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euripides]] in his ''[[Iphigenia in Aulis]]'' gives an account of his fight with Python and the event's aftermath. 
{{blockquote|You killed him, o Phoebus, while still a baby, still leaping in the arms of your dear mother, and you entered the holy shrine, and sat on the golden tripod, on your truthful throne distributing prophecies from the gods to mortals.}}

A detailed account of Apollo's conflict with Gaia and Zeus' intervention on behalf of his young son is also given. 
{{blockquote|But when Apollo came and sent Themis, the child of Earth, away from the holy oracle of Pytho, Earth gave birth to dream visions of the night; and they told to the cities of men the present, and what will happen in the future, through dark beds of sleep on the ground; and so Earth took the office of prophecy away from Phoebus, in envy, because of her daughter. The lord made his swift way to Olympus and wound his baby hands around Zeus, asking him to take the wrath of the earth goddess from the Pythian home. Zeus smiled, that the child so quickly came to ask for worship that pays in gold. He shook his locks of hair, put an end to the night voices, and took away from mortals the truth that appears in darkness, and gave the privilege back again to Loxias.}}
Apollo also demanded that all other methods of divination be made inferior to his, a wish that Zeus granted him readily. Because of this, Athena, who had been practicing divination by throwing pebbles, cast her pebbles away in displeasure.&lt;ref&gt;John Opsopaus, ''The Oracles of Apollo: Practical Ancient Greek Divination for Today''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo Killing the Python LACMA 54.70.1i.jpg|thumb|Apollo killing the Python, by [[Hendrick Goltzius|Hendrik Goltzius]]]]

However, Apollo had committed a blood murder and had to be purified. Because Python was a child of [[Gaia]], Gaia wanted Apollo to be banished to Tartarus as a punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Pindar's Paeans: A Reading of the Fragments with a Survey of the Genre&lt;/ref&gt; Zeus didn't agree and instead exiled his son from [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], and instructed him to get purified. Apollo had to serve as a slave for nine years.&lt;ref&gt;John Lemprière, ''Bibliotheca Classica''&lt;/ref&gt; After the servitude was over, as per his father's order, he travelled to the [[Vale of Tempe]] to bath in waters of [[Pineios (Thessaly)|Peneus]].&lt;ref&gt;The Uses of Greek Mythology By Ken Dowden&lt;/ref&gt; There Zeus himself performed purificatory rites on Apollo. Purified, Apollo was escorted by his half sister [[Athena]] to Delphi where the oracular shrine was finally handed over to him by Gaia.&lt;ref&gt;Aristonous: Paean To Apollo&lt;/ref&gt; According to a variation, Apollo had also travelled to Crete, where [[Carmanor (of Crete)|Carmanor]] purified him. Apollo later established the [[Pythian games]] to appropriate Gaia. Henceforth, Apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder and, made men aware of their guilt and purified them.&lt;ref&gt;Apollo, Fritz Graf&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, Zeus instructed Apollo to go to Delphi and establish his law. But Apollo, disobeying his father, went to the land of [[Hyperborea]] and stayed there for a year.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy P. Bridgman, ''Hyperboreans: Myth and History in Celtic-Hellenic Contacts''&lt;/ref&gt; He returned only after the Delphians sang hymns to him and pleaded him to come back. Zeus, pleased with his son's integrity, gave Apollo the seat next to him on his right side. He also gave to Apollo various gifts, like a golden tripod, a golden bow and arrows, a golden chariot and the city of Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Acosta-Hughes, Luigi Lehnus, Susan Stephens - ''Brill's Companion to Callimachus''&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his return, Apollo needed to recruit people to Delphi. So, when he spotted a ship sailing from Crete, he sprang aboard in the form of a dolphin. The crew was awed into submission and followed a course that led the ship to Delphi. There Apollo revealed himself as a god. Initiating them to his service, he instructed them to keep righteousness in their hearts. The [[Pythia]] was Apollo's high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies. Pythia is arguably the constant favorite of Apollo among the mortals.

====Tityos====
[[File:Apollo Tityos Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2689.jpg|thumb|Apollo slaying [[Tityos]], Attic red-figure kylix, 460–450 BC]]

Hera once again sent another giant, [[Tityos]] to rape Leto. This time Apollo shot him with his arrows and attacked him with his golden sword. According to other version, Artemis also aided him in protecting their mother by attacking Tityos with her arrows.&lt;ref&gt;Scholia on [[Pindar]], ''Pythian Odes'' 4.160 citing Pherecydes&lt;/ref&gt; After the battle Zeus finally relented his aid and hurled Tityos down to [[Tartarus]]. There, he was pegged to the rock floor, covering an area of {{convert|9|acre|m2}}, where a pair of [[vulture]]s feasted daily on his liver.

===Admetus===
[[File:Drawing, Apollo Guards the Herds (or Flocks) of King Admetus, 1780–1800 (CH 18122047).jpg|thumb|Apollo Guards the Herds (or Flocks) of King [[Admetus]], by [[Felice Giani|Felice Gianni]]]]

[[Admetus]] was the king of [[Pherae]], who was known for his hospitality. When Apollo was exiled from Olympus for killing Python, he served as a herdsman under Admetus, who was then young and unmarried. Apollo is said to have shared a romantic relationship with Admetus during his stay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Callimachus]], Hymn II to Apollo.&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his years of servitude, Apollo went back to Olympus as a god.

Because Admetus had treated Apollo well, the god conferred great benefits on him in return. Apollo's mere presence is said to have made the cattle give birth to twins.&lt;ref name="bib-3-10-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Apollo helped Admetus win the hand of [[Alcestis]], the daughter of [[Pelias|King Pelias]],&lt;ref name="bib-1-9-15"&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9%3Asection%3D15 1.9.15].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hyginus-50"&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [https://topostext.org/work/206#50 50-51].&lt;/ref&gt; by taming a lion and a boar to draw Admetus' chariot. He was present during their wedding to give his blessings. When Admetus angered the goddess Artemis by forgetting to give her the due offerings, Apollo came to the rescue and calmed his sister.&lt;ref name="bib-1-9-15" /&gt; When Apollo learnt of Admetus' untimely death, he convinced or tricked the [[Moirai|Fates]] into letting Admetus live past his time.&lt;ref name="bib-1-9-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hyginus-50" /&gt;

According to another version, or perhaps some years later, when Zeus struck down Apollo's son [[Asclepius]] with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead, Apollo in revenge killed the [[Cyclopes]], who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus.&lt;ref name="bib-3-10-4"&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D10%3Asection%3D4 3.10.4].&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo would have been banished to [[Tartarus]] for this, but his mother [[Leto]] intervened, and reminding Zeus of their old love, pleaded him not to kill their son. Zeus obliged and sentenced Apollo to one year of [[Penal labour|hard labor]] once again under Admetus.&lt;ref name="bib-3-10-4" /&gt;

The love between Apollo and Admetus was a favored topic of Roman poets like [[Ovid]] and [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]].

===Niobe===
[[File:Pierre-Charles Jombert - Les enfants de Niobé tués par Apollon et Diane.JPG|thumb|286x286px|''Niobe's children are killed by Apollo and Diana'' by [[Pierre-Charles Jombert]]]]

The fate of [[Niobe]] was prophesied by Apollo while he was still in Leto's womb.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Niobe was the queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and wife of [[Amphion]]. She displayed [[hubris]] when she boasted that she was superior to Leto because she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two. She further mocked Apollo's effeminate appearance and Artemis' manly appearance. Leto, insulted by this, told her children to punish Niobe. Accordingly, Apollo killed Niobe's sons, and Artemis her daughters. According to some versions of the myth, among the Niobids, Chloris and her brother Amyclas were not killed because they prayed to Leto. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.

A devastated Niobe fled to [[Spil Mount|Mount Sipylos]] in [[Asia Minor]] and turned into stone as she wept. Her tears formed the river [[Achelous]]. Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.

When Chloris married and had children, Apollo granted her son [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] the years he had taken away from the Niobids. Hence, Nestor was able to live for 3 generations.&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' [https://topostext.org/work/206#10 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building the walls of Troy ===

[[File:Sandrart (attributed), Troppa (attr.) - Laomedon Refusing Payment to Poseidon and Apollo - 17th c.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Laomedon Refusing Payment to Poseidon and Apollo, by [[Joachim von Sandrart]]]]

Once Apollo and [[Poseidon]] served under the Trojan king [[Laomedon]] in accordance to Zeus' words. Apollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king disguised as humans in order to check his hubris.&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.5&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo guarded the cattle of Laomedon in the valleys of mount Ida, while Poseidon built the walls of Troy.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''The Iliad'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D21%3Acard%3D434 21.434]&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions make both Apollo and Poseidon the builders of the wall. In Ovid's account, Apollo completes his task by playing his tunes on his lyre.

In [[Pindar]]'s odes, the gods took a mortal named [[Aeacus]] as their assistant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Olympian Odes'' viii. 39, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt; When the work was completed, three snakes rushed against the wall, and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead, the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by Aeacus. Apollo immediately prophesied that [[Troy]] would fall at the hands of Aeacus's descendants, the [[Aeacidae]] (i.e. his son Telamon joined [[Heracles]] when he sieged the city during Laomedon's rule. Later, his great-grandson [[Neoptolemus]] was present in the wooden horse that lead to the downfall of Troy).

However, the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised, but also threatened to bind their feet and hands, and sell them as slaves. Angered by the unpaid labour and the insults, Apollo infected the city with a pestilence and Posedion sent the sea monster [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]]. To deliver the city from it, Laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter [[Hesione]] (who would later be saved by [[Heracles]]).

During his stay in Troy, Apollo had a lover named Ourea, who was a nymph and daughter of Poseidon. Together they had a son named Ileus, whom Apollo loved dearly.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Hesiod, ''Catalogues of Women'' Fragment 83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trojan War===

Apollo sided with the Trojans during the [[Trojan War]] waged by the Greeks against the Trojans.

During the war, the Greek king [[Agamemnon]] captured [[Chryseis]], the daughter of Apollo's priest [[Chryses]], and refused to return her. Angered by this, Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment. He demanded that they return the girl, and the Achaeans (Greeks) complied, indirectly causing the ''[[Achilles and Patroclus#In the Iliad|anger of Achilles]]'', which is the theme of the ''[[Iliad]]''.

[[File:John Flaxman - Apollo Preceding Hector with His Aegis, and Dispersing the Greeks, Fuseli's Lectures - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Apollo preceding [[Hector]] with his [[Aegis]], and dispersing the Greeks, by [[John Flaxman]]]]

Receiving the [[aegis]] from Zeus, Apollo entered the battlefield as per his father's command, causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry. He pushed the Greeks back and destroyed many of the soldiers. He is described as "the rouser of armies" because he rallied the Trojan army when they were falling apart.

When Zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war, Apollo was provoked by Poseidon to a duel. However, Apollo declined to fight him, saying that he wouldn't fight his uncle for the sake of mortals.

[[File:Diomedes prevented by Apollo from pursuing Aeneas (?) MET 80355.jpg|thumb|Apollo prevents [[Diomedes]] from pursuing [[Aeneas]]]]

When the Greek hero [[Diomedes]] injured the Trojan hero [[Aeneas]], [[Aphrodite]] tried to rescue him, but Diomedes injured her as well. Apollo then enveloped Aeneas in a cloud to protect him. He repelled the attacks Diomedes made on him and gave the hero a stern warning to abstain himself from attacking a god. Aeneas was then taken to Pergamos, a sacred spot in [[Troy]], where he was healed.

After the death of [[Sarpedon (Trojan War hero)|Sarpedon]], a son of Zeus, Apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his father's wish and cleaned it. He then gave it to Sleep ([[Hypnos]]) and Death ([[Thanatos]]). Apollo had also once convinced Athena to stop the war for that day, so that the warriors can relieve themselves for a while.

[[File:Hector's body dragged at the Chariot of Achilles.jpg|thumb|Apollo protecting Hector's body, by [[John Flaxman]]]]

The Trojan hero [[Hector]] (who, according to some, was the god's own son by [[Hecuba]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Stesichorus]], Fr. 108; [[Tzetzes]], ''On Lycophron''  266; Porphyry in his ''Omissions'' states that [[Ibycus]], [[Alexander Aetolus|Alexander]], [[Euphorion of Chalcis|Euphorion]] and [[Lycophron]] all made Hector the son of Apollo.&lt;/ref&gt;) was favored by Apollo. When he got severely injured, Apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up his arms. During a duel with Achilles, when Hector was about to lose, Apollo hid Hector in a cloud of mist to save him. When the Greek warrior [[Patroclus]] tried to get into the fort of Troy, he was stopped by Apollo. Encouraging Hector to attack Patroclus, Apollo stripped the armour of the Greek warrior and broke his weapons. Patroclus was eventually killed by Hector. At last, after Hector's fated death, Apollo protected his corpse from Achilles' attempt to mutilate it by creating a magical cloud over the corpse, shielding it from the rays of the [[Helios|sun]].

Apollo held a grudge against Achilles throughout the war because Achilles had murdered his son [[Tenes]] before the war began and brutally assassinated his son [[Troilus]] in his own temple. Not only did Apollo save Hector from Achilles, he also tricked Achilles by disguising himself as a Trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates. He foiled Achilles' attempt to mutilate Hector's dead body.

Finally, Apollo caused Achilles' death by guiding an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] into [[Achilles]]' heel. In some versions, Apollo himself killed Achilles by taking the disguise of Paris.

Apollo helped many Trojan warriors, including [[Agenor]], [[Polydamas (mythology)|Polydamas]], [[Glaucus]] in the battlefield. Though he greatly favored the Trojans, Apollo was bound to follow the orders of Zeus and served his father loyally during the war.

===Heracles===

After [[Heracles]] (then named Alcides) was struck with madness and killed his family, he sought to purify himself and consulted the oracle of Apollo. Apollo, through the Pythia, commanded him to serve king [[Eurystheus]] for twelve years and complete the ten tasks the king would give him. Only then would Alcides be absolved of his sin. Apollo also renamed him as Heracles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D4%3Asection%3D12 2.4.12].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Corinthian helmet Cdm Paris BB2013 n2.jpg|thumb|right|Heracles and Apollo struggling over the Hind, as depicted on a Corinthian helmet (early 5th century BC)]]

To complete his third task, Heracles had to capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]], a hind sacred to Artemis, and bring back it alive. After chasing the hind for one year, the animal eventually got tired, and when it tried crossing the river Ladon, Heracles captured it. While he was taking it back, he was confronted by Apollo and Artemis, who were angered at Heracles for this act. However, Heracles soothed the goddess and explained his situation to her. After much pleading, Artemis permitted him to take the hind and told him to return it later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D3 2.5.3].&lt;/ref&gt;

After he was freed from his servitude to Eurystheus, Heracles fell in conflict with Iphytus, a prince of Oechalia, and murdered him. Soon after, he contracted a terrible disease. He consulted the oracle of Apollo once again, in hope of ridding himself of the disease. The Pythia, however, denied to give any prophesy. In anger, Heracles snatched the sacred tripod and started walking away, intending to start his own oracle. However, Apollo did not tolerate this and stopped Heracles; a duel ensued between them. Artemis rushed to support Apollo, while Athena supported Heracles. Soon, Zeus threw his thunderbolt between the fighting brothers and separated them. He reprimanded Heracles for this act of violation and asked Apollo to give a solution to Heracles. Apollo then ordered the hero to serve under [[Omphale]], queen of [[Lydia]] for one year in order to purify himself.

===Periphas===

[[Periphas]] was an Attican king and a priest of Apollo. He was noble, just and rich. He did all his duties justly. Because of this people were very fond of him and started honouring him to the same extent as Zeus. At one point, they worshipped Periphas in place of Zeus and set up shrines and temples for him. This annoyed Zeus, who decided to annihilate the entire family of Periphas. But because he was a just king and a good devotee, Apollo intervened and requested his father to spare Periphas. Zeus considered Apollo's words and agreed to let him live. But he metamorphosed Periphas into an eagle and made the eagle the king of birds. When Periphas' wife requested Zeus to let her stay with her husband, Zeus turned her into a vulture and fulfilled her wish.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'' [https://topostext.org/work/216#6 6]; Grimal, s.v. Periphas (2), p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plato's concept of soulmates===

A long time ago, there were three kinds of human beings: male, descended from the sun; female, descended from the earth; and androgynous, descended from the moon. Each human being was completely round, with four arms and fours legs, two identical faces on opposite sides of a head with four ears, and all else to match. They were powerful and unruly. [[Aloadae|Otis]] and [[Aloadae|Ephialtes]] even dared to scale [[Mount Olympus]].

To check their insolence, Zeus devised a plan to humble them and improve their manners instead of completely destroying them. He cut them all in two and asked Apollo to make necessary repairs, giving humans the individual shape they still have now. Apollo turned their heads and necks around towards their wounds, he pulled together their skin at the [[abdomen]], and sewed the skin together at the middle of it. This is what we call [[navel]] today. He smoothened the wrinkles and shaped the chest. But he made sure to leave a few wrinkles on the abdomen and around the navel so that they might be reminded of their punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[The Symposium]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|"As he [Zeus] cut them one after another, he bade Apollo give the face and the half of the neck a turn... Apollo was also bidden to heal their wounds and compose their forms. So Apollo gave a turn to the face and pulled the skin from the sides all over that which in our language is called the belly, like the purses which draw in, and he made one mouth at the centre [of the belly] which he fastened in a knot (the same which is called the navel); he also moulded the breast and took out most of the wrinkles, much as a shoemaker might smooth leather upon a last; he left a few wrinkles, however, in the region of the belly and navel, as a memorial of the primeval state.}}

===Nurturer of the young===

Apollo ''Kourotrophos'' is the god who nurtures and protects children and the young, especially boys. He oversees their education and their passage into adulthood. Education is said to have originated from Apollo and the [[Muses]]. Many myths have him train his children. It was a custom for boys to cut and dedicate their long hair to Apollo after reaching adulthood.

[[Chiron]], the abandoned [[centaur]], was fostered by Apollo, who instructed him in medicine, prophecy, archery and more. Chiron would later become a great teacher himself.

[[Asclepius]] in his childhood gained much knowledge pertaining to medicinal arts by his father. However, he was later entrusted to Chiron for further education.

[[Anius]], Apollo's son by [[Rhoeo]], was abandoned by his mother soon after his birth. Apollo brought him up and educated him in mantic arts. Anius later became the priest of Apollo and the king of Delos.

[[Iamus]] was the son of Apollo and [[Evadne]]. When Evadne went into labour, Apollo sent the [[Moirai]] to assist his lover. After the child was born, Apollo sent snakes to feed the child some honey. When Iamus reached the age of education, Apollo took him to Olympia and taught him many arts, including the ability to understand and explain the languages of birds.&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, Olympian Ode 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Idmon]] was educated by Apollo to be a seer. Even though he foresaw his death that would happen in his journey with the [[Argonauts]], he embraced his destiny and died a brave death. To commemorate his son's bravery, Apollo commanded Boeotians to build a town around the tomb of the hero, and to honor him.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius Rhodius. Argonautica ii, 846 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo adopted [[Carnus]], the abandoned son of Zeus and [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]]. He reared the child with the help of his mother Leto and educated him to be a seer.

When his son [[Melaneus of Oechalia|Melaneus]] reached the age of marriage, Apollo asked the princess [[Stratonice (mythology)|Stratonice]] to be his son's bride and carried her away from her home when she agreed.

Apollo saved a shepherd boy (name unknown) from death in a large deep cave, by the means of vultures. To thank him, the shepherd built Apollo a temple under the name Vulturius.&lt;ref&gt;The Cyclopedia, Or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature, Volume 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===God of music===

[[File:The music of the spheres.jpg|thumb|220px|The music of the spheres. Shown in this engraving from Renaissance Italy are Apollo, the Muses, the planetary spheres and musical ratios.]]

Immediately after his birth, Apollo demanded a lyre and invented the [[paean]], thus becoming the god of music. As the divine singer, he is the patron of poets, singers and musicians. The invention of string music is attributed to him. [[Plato]] said that the innate ability of humans to take delight in music, rhythm and harmony is the gift of Apollo and the Muses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Laws (Plato)|Laws]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0166%3Abook%3D2%3Apage%3D653 653.4]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Socrates]], ancient Greeks believed that Apollo is the god who directs the harmony and makes all things move together, both for the gods and the humans. For this reason, he was called ''Homopolon'' before the ''Homo'' was replaced by ''A''.&lt;ref&gt;The prefix ''A'' means "without" or "not", and ''polloi'' means "many", thus ''Apollo'' means "not many" or "united", referring to his ability to create harmony.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's harmonious music delivered people from their pain, and hence, like Dionysus, he is also called the liberator.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The swans, which were considered to be the most musical among the birds, were believed to be the "singers of Apollo". They are Apollo's sacred birds and acted as his vehicle during his travel to [[Hyperborea]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] says that when the singers would sing hymns to Apollo, the swans would join the chant in unison.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''On the nature of Animals'' 11. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parnassus, Andrea Appiani (1811).jpg|thumb|270px|Apollo and the Muses on Parnassus, by [[Andrea Appiani]]|left]]

Among the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], the study of mathematics and music were connected to the worship of Apollo, their principal deity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''[[Varia Historia]]'', 2. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], 8.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]], ''Vit. Pyth.'' 8.91.141&lt;/ref&gt; Their belief was that the music purifies the soul, just as medicine purifies the body. They also believed that music was delegated to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the mechanics of the cosmos, evolving into an idea known as the [[music of the spheres]].&lt;ref&gt;Landels, John G (1999) ''Music in Ancient Greece and Rome''&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo appears as the companion of the [[Muses]], and as [[Musagetes]] ("leader of Muses") he leads them in dance. They spend their time on [[Parnassus]], which is one of their sacred places. Apollo is also the lover of the Muses and by them he became the father of famous musicians like [[Orpheus]] and [[Linus of Thrace|Linus]].

Apollo is often found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the [[lyre]].&lt;ref&gt;Iliad (i. 603)&lt;/ref&gt; In his role as the god of banquets, he was always present to play music in weddings of the gods, like the marriage of [[Eros]] and [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]. He is a frequent guest of the [[Bacchanalia]], and many ancient ceramics depict him being at ease amidst the [[maenads]] and satyrs.&lt;ref&gt;Detienne, Marcel (2001) ''Forgetting Delphi between Apollo and Dionysus''&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo also participated in musical contests when challenged by others. He was the victor in all those contests, but he tended to punish his opponents severely for their [[hubris]].

====Apollo's lyre====

The invention of lyre is attributed either to [[Hermes]] or to Apollo himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homeric Hymn to Hermes (IV, 1-506)|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0138%3ahymn%3d4|website=Perseus|access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctions have been made that Hermes invented lyre made of tortoise shell, whereas the lyre Apollo invented was a regular lyre.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myths tell that the infant Hermes stole a number of Apollo's cows and took them to a cave in the woods near [[Pylos]], covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a [[tortoise]] and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made his [[lyre]].

[[File:Noël Coypel - Story of Apollo-Apollo and Mercury, 1688.jpg|thumb|180px|The friendship of Apollo and Hermes, by [[Noël Coypel]]]]

Upon discovering the theft, Apollo confronted Hermes and asked him to return his cattle. When Hermes acted innocent, Apollo took the matter to Zeus. Zeus, having seen the events, sided with Apollo, and ordered Hermes to return the cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA162 p. 162].&lt;/ref&gt; Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo fell in love with the instrument and offered to exchange the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo then became the master of the lyre.

According to other versions, Apollo had invented the lyre himself, whose strings he tore in repenting of the excess punishment he had given to [[Marsyas]]. Hermes' lyre, therefore, would be a reinvention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Norman O.|last=Brown|title=Hermes the Thief: The Evolution of a Myth|year=1947 |isbn=0-940262-26-6|location=Madison|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contest with Pan====

[[File:Laurits Regner Tuxen The-Musical-Dual-Of-Pan-And-Apollo.jpg|thumb|The musical duel of Pan and Apollo, by [[Laurits Tuxen]]]]

Once [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo and to challenge the god of music to a contest. The mountain-god [[Tmolus (son of Ares)|Tmolus]] was chosen to umpire. Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, [[Midas]], who happened to be present. Then, Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. It was so beautiful that Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and everyone was pleased with the judgement. Only Midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo did not want to suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a [[donkey]].

====Contest with Marsyas====

[[Marsyas]] was a [[satyr]] who was punished by Apollo for his [[hubris]]. He had found an [[aulos]] on the ground, tossed away after being invented by [[Athena]] because it made her cheeks puffy. Athena had also placed a curse upon the instrument, that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished. When Marsyas played the flute, everyone became frenzied with joy. This led Marsyas to think that he was better than Apollo, and he challenged the god to a musical contest. The contest was judged by the [[Muse]]s, or the nymphs of [[Nysa (mythology)|Nysa]]. Athena was also present to witness the contest.

Marsyas taunted Apollo for "wearing his hair long, for having a fair face and smooth body, for his skill in so many arts".&lt;ref name="Apuleius, Florida 3.2"&gt;Apuleius, ''Florida'' 3.2&lt;/ref&gt; He also further said,

{{blockquote|'His [Apollo] hair is smooth and made into tufts and curls that fall about his brow and hang before his face. His body is fair from head to foot, his limbs shine bright, his tongue gives oracles, and he is equally eloquent in prose or verse, propose which you will. What of his robes so fine in texture, so soft to the touch, aglow with purple? What of his lyre that flashes gold, gleams white with ivory, and shimmers with rainbow gems? What of his song, so cunning and so sweet? Nay, all these allurements suit with naught save luxury. To virtue they bring shame alone!'&lt;ref name="Apuleius, Florida 3.2"/&gt;}}

The Muses and Athena sniggered at this comment. The contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was that the victor could "do whatever he wanted" to the loser.

[[File:05apol1.jpg|thumb|260px|The contest between Apollo and [[Marsyas]] by [[Palma il Giovane]]|left]]

According to one account, after the first round, they both were deemed equal by the [[Nysiads]]. But in the next round, Apollo decided to play on his lyre and add his melodious voice to his performance. Marsyas argued against this, saying that Apollo would have an advantage and accused Apollo of cheating. But Apollo replied that since Marsyas played the flute, which needed air blown from the throat, it was similar to singing, and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all. The nymphs decided that Apollo's argument was just. Apollo then played his lyre and sang at the same time, mesmerising the audience. Marsyas could not do this. Apollo was declared the winner and, angered with Marsyas' haughtiness and his accusations, decided to flay the satyr.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 75. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marsyas Flayed by the Order of Apollo - Charles André van Loo (1735).jpg|thumb|Marsyas Flayed by the Order of Apollo, by	[[Charles-André van Loo]]]]

According to another account, Marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat. Out of shame, he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack.&lt;ref&gt;Philostratus the Younger, Imagines 2 (trans. Fairbanks)&lt;/ref&gt; Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument. So the Muses who were the judges declared Apollo the winner. Apollo hung Marsyas from a tree to flay him.&lt;ref&gt;''Man Myth and Magic'' by Richard Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo [[flaying|flayed]] the limbs of Marsyas alive in a cave near [[Celaenae]] in [[Phrygia]] for his [[hubris]] to challenge a god. He then gave the rest of his body for proper burial&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [https://topostext.org/work/206#165 165].&lt;/ref&gt; and nailed Marsyas' flayed skin to a nearby pine-tree as a lesson to the others. Marsyas' blood turned into the river Marsyas. But Apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done, he tore the strings of his lyre and threw it away. The lyre was later discovered by the Muses and Apollo's sons [[Linus of Thrace|Linus]] and [[Orpheus]]. The Muses fixed the middle string, Linus the string struck with the forefinger, and Orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it. They took it back to Apollo, but the god, who had decided to stay away from music for a while, laid away both the lyre and the pipes at Delphi and joined [[Cybele]] in her wanderings to as far as [[Hyperborea]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apostle Arne Horn, ''The Book of Eusebius'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contest with Cinyras====

Cinyras was a ruler of [[Cyprus]], who was a friend of [[Agamemnon]]. Cinyras promised to assist Agamemnon in the Trojan war, but did not keep his promise. Agamemnon cursed Cinyras. He invoked Apollo and asked the god to avenge the broken promise. Apollo then had a [[lyre]]-playing contest with [[Cinyras]], and defeated him. Either Cinyras committed suicide when he lost, or was killed by Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D11%3Acard%3D1 11.20&amp;ndash;23].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius on Iliad; cf. also scholia on the same passage&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollon Raon Versailles MV5921.jpg|thumb|Apollon Raon, [[Versailles]]]]

===Patron of sailors===
Apollo functions as the patron and protector of sailors, one of the duties he shares with [[Poseidon]]. In the myths, he is seen helping heroes who pray to him for safe journey.

When Apollo spotted a ship of Cretan sailors that was caught in a storm, he quickly assumed the shape of a dolphin and guided their ship safely to Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Hymn to Pythian Apollo''&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Argonauts]] faced a terrible storm, [[Jason]] prayed to his patron, Apollo, to help them. Apollo used his bow and golden arrow to shed light upon an island, where the Argonauts soon took shelter. This island was renamed "[[Anafi|Anaphe]]", which means "He revealed it".&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius of Rhodes, ''Argonautica''&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo helped the Greek hero [[Diomedes]], to escape from a great tempest during his journey homeward. As a token of gratitude, Diomedes built a temple in honor of Apollo under the epithet Epibaterius ("the embarker").&lt;ref&gt;John Potter, ''Archaeologia Graeca: Or, The Antiquities of Greece, Volume 1''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Trojan War, [[Odysseus]] came to the Trojan camp to return Chriseis, the daughter of Apollo's priest [[Chryses]], and brought many offerings to Apollo. Pleased with this, Apollo sent gentle breezes that helped Odysseus return safely to the Greek camp.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''the Ilaid'' 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arion]] was a poet who was kidnapped by some sailors for the rich prizes he possessed. Arion requested them to let him sing for the last time, to which the sailors consented. Arion began singing a song in praise of Apollo, seeking the god's help. Consequently, numerous dolphins surrounded the ship and when Arion jumped into the water, the dolphins carried him away safely.

===Wars===

====Titanomachy====
Once [[Hera]], out of spite, aroused the Titans to war against [[Zeus]] and take away his throne. Accordingly, when the Titans tried to climb [[Mount Olympus]], Zeus with the help of Apollo, [[Artemis]] and [[Athena]], defeated them and cast them into tartarus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [https://topostext.org/work/206#150 150].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trojan War====
Apollo played a pivotal role in the entire Trojan War. He sided with the Trojans, and sent a terrible plague to the Greek camp, which indirectly led to the conflict between [[Achilles]] and [[Agamemnon]]. He killed the Greek heroes [[Patroclus]], Achilles, and numerous Greek soldiers. He also helped many Trojan heroes, the most important one being [[Hector]]. After the end of the war, Apollo and Poseidon together cleaned the remains of the city and the camps.

====Telegony war====
A war broke out between the [[Brygoi]] and the Thesprotians, who had the support of [[Odysseus]]. The gods Athena and [[Ares]] came to the battlefield and took sides. Athena helped the hero Odysseus while Ares fought alongside of the Brygoi. When Odysseus lost, Athena and Ares came into a direct duel. To stop the battling gods and the terror created by their battle, Apollo intervened and stopped the duel between them.&lt;ref&gt;Eugammon of Cyrene, ''Telegony Fragment''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Sammons, ''Device and Composition in the Greek Epic Cycle''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indian war====
When Zeus suggested that [[Dionysus]] defeat the Indians in order to earn a place among the gods, Dionysus declared war against the Indians and travelled to [[India]] along with his army of [[Bacchantes]] and [[satyrs]]. Among the warriors was [[Aristaeus]], Apollo's son. Apollo armed his son with his own hands and gave him a bow and arrows and fitted a strong shield to his arm.&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'' 13&lt;/ref&gt; After Zeus urged Apollo to join the war, he went to the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'' 27&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing several of his [[nymphs]] and Aristaeus drowning in a river, he took them to safety and healed them.&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'' 24&lt;/ref&gt; He taught Aristaeus more useful healing arts and sent him back to help the army of Dionysus.

====Theban war====
During the war between the sons of [[Oedipus]], Apollo favored [[Amphiaraus]], a seer and one of the leaders in the war. Though saddened that the seer was fated to be doomed in the war, Apollo made Amphiaraus' last hours glorious by "lighting his shield and his helm with starry gleam". When [[Hypseus]] tried to kill the hero by a spear, Apollo directed the spear towards the charioteer of Amphiaraus instead. Then Apollo himself replaced the charioteer and took the reins in his hands. He deflected many spears and arrows away them. He also killed many of the enemy warriors like [[Melaneus (mythology)|Melaneus]], [[Antiphus]], Aetion, Polites and [[Lampus]]. At last when the moment of departure came, Apollo expressed his grief with tears in his eyes and bid farewell to Amphiaraus, who was soon engulfed by the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Statius, ''Thebaid'' 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slaying of giants===

Apollo killed the giants Python and Tityos, who had assaulted his mother Leto.

====Gigantomachy====
During the [[gigantomachy]], Apollo and [[Heracles]] blinded the giant [[Ephialtes (disambiguation)|Ephialtes]] by shooting him in his eyes, Apollo shooting his left and Heracles his right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D6%3Asection%3D2 1.6.2].&lt;/ref&gt; He also killed [[Porphyrion]], the king of giants, using his bow and arrows.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Pythian'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DP.%3Apoem%3D8 8.12–18].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aloadae====
The [[Aloadae]], namely Otis and Ephialtes, were twin giants who decided to wage war upon the gods. They attempted to storm Mt. Olympus by piling up mountains, and threatened to fill the sea with mountains and inundate dry land.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, s.v. Aloadae, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; They even dared to seek the hand of Hera and Artemis in marriage. Angered by this, Apollo killed them by shooting them with arrows.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D11%3Acard%3D271 11.305].&lt;/ref&gt; According to another tale, Apollo killed them by sending a deer between them; as they tried to kill it with their javelins, they accidentally stabbed each other and died.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [https://topostext.org/work/206#28 28].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phorbas====
[[Phorbas]] was a savage giant king of [[Phlegyas (Boeotia)|Phlegyas]] who was described as having swine like features. He wished to plunder Delphi for its wealth. He seized the roads to Delphi and started harassing the pilgrims. He captured the old people and children and sent them to his army to hold them for ransom. And he challenged the young and sturdy men to a match of boxing, only to cut their heads off when they would get defeated by him. He hung the chopped off heads to an oak tree. Finally, Apollo came to put an end to this cruelty. He entered a boxing contest with Phorbas and killed him with a single blow.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus the Elder]], ''[[Imagines (work by Philostratus)|Imagines]]'' [https://archive.org/details/imagines00philuoft/page/214/mode/2up?view=theater 2.19].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first [[Olympic games]], Apollo defeated [[Ares]] and became the victor in wrestling. He outran [[Hermes]] in the race and won first place.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Histories 5. 7. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo divides months into summer and winter.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Orphic Hymn]]'' 34 ''to Apollon'', 21 (Athanassakis and Wolkow, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTo3r8IHy0wC&amp;pg=PA30 pp. 30&amp;ndash;31]).&lt;/ref&gt; He rides on the back of a swan to the land of the [[Hyperborea]]ns during the winter months, and the absence of warmth in winters is due to his departure. During his absence, Delphi was under the care of [[Dionysus]], and no prophecies were given during winters.

==== Molpadia and Parthenos ====

Molpadia and Parthenos were the sisters of [[Rhoeo]], a former lover of Apollo. One day, they were put in charge of watching their father's ancestral wine jar but they fell asleep while performing this duty. While they were asleep, the wine jar was broken by the swines their family kept. When the sisters woke up and saw what had happened, they threw themselves off a cliff in fear of their father's wrath. Apollo, who was passing by, caught them and carried them to two different cities in Chersonesus, Molpadia to Castabus and Parthenos to Bubastus. He turned them into goddesses and they both received divine honors. Molpadia's name was changed to [[Hemithea (mythology)|Hemithea]] upon her deification.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, 5. 62. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prometheus ====

[[Prometheus]] was the titan who was punished by Zeus for stealing fire. He was bound to a rock, where each day an eagle was sent to eat Prometheus' liver, which would then grow back overnight to be eaten again the next day. Seeing his plight, Apollo pleaded Zeus to release the kind Titan, while Artemis and Leto stood behind him with tears in their eyes. Zeus, moved by Apollo's words and the tears of the goddesses, finally sent Heracles to free Prometheus.&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Flaccus, ''Argonautica'' 4. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Once, Aphrodite fell deeply in love with [[Adonis]], a young man of great beauty who was later accidentally killed by a boar. Heartbroken, Aphrodite wandered looking for the rock of Leukas. When she reached the sanctuary of Apollo in Argos, she confided in him her love and sorrow. Apollo then brought her to the rock of Leukas and asked her to throw herself from the top of the rock. She did so and was freed from her love. When she sought for the reason behind this, Apollo told her that Zeus, before taking another lover, would sit on this rock to free himself from his love to Hera.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;Ptolemy Hephaestion, ''New History Book'' 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tale relates that a man named Nireus, who fell in love with the cult statue of Athena, came to the rock and jumped in order relieve himself. After jumping, he fell into the net of a fisherman in which, when he was pulled out, he found a box filled with gold. He fought with the fisherman and took the gold, but Apollo appeared to him in the night in a dream and warned him not to appropriate gold which belonged to others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

It was an ancestral custom among the Leukadians to fling a criminal from this rock every year at the sacrifice performed in honor of Apollo for the sake of averting evil. However, a number of men would be stationed all around below rock to catch the criminal and take him out of the borders in order to exile him from the island.&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''On Animals'' 11. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; This was the same rock from which, according to a legend, Sappho took her suicidal leap.&lt;ref name="Strabo, Geography 10. 2. 8"/&gt;

===Female lovers===

Love affairs ascribed to Apollo are a late development in Greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;"The love-stories themselves were not told until later." [[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Gods of the Greeks'' 1951:140.&lt;/ref&gt; Their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the Renaissance, the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination.

{{Main|Apollo and Daphne}}

[[File:Apollo and Daphne (Bernini).jpg|thumb|340x340px|''[[Apollo and Daphne]]'' by [[Bernini]] in the [[Galleria Borghese]]|left]]
[[Daphne]] was a [[nymph]] who scorned Apollo's advances and ran away from him. When Apollo chased her in order to persuade her, she changed herself into a laurel tree. According to other versions, she cried for help during the chase, and [[Gaia]] helped her by taking her in and placing a laurel tree in her place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [https://topostext.org/work/206#203 203].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roman poet [[Ovid]], the chase was brought about by [[Cupid]], who hit Apollo with golden arrow of love and Daphne with leaden arrow of hatred.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0074%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D452 1.452-567]; Tripp, s.v. Daphne.&lt;/ref&gt; The myth explains the origin of the [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] and connection of Apollo with the laurel and its leaves, which his priestess employed at [[Delphi]]. The leaves became the symbol of victory and laurel wreaths were given to the victors of the [[Pythian games]].

[[File:Robert Sanderson - Apollo and the Muses.jpg|thumb|Apollo and the Muses, by Robert Sanderson]]
Apollo is said to have been the lover of all nine [[Muses]], and not being able to choose one of them, decided to remain unwed. He fathered the [[Corybantes]] by the Muse [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D3%3Asection%3D4 1.3.4].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orpheus]] by [[Calliope]], [[Linus (Thracian)|Linus of Thrace]] by Calliope or [[Urania]] and [[Hymenaios]] (Hymen) by one of the [[Muses]].

In the Great Eoiae that is attributed to Hesoid, Scylla is the daughter of Apollo and Hecate.&lt;ref&gt;Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, Arg. iv. 828&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyrene (mythology)|Cyrene]] was a Thessalian princess whom Apollo loved. In her honor, he built the city Cyrene and made her its ruler. She was later granted longevity by Apollo who turned her into a nymph. The couple had two sons, [[Aristaeus]], and [[Idmon]].

[[Evadne]] was a nymph daughter of Poseidon and a lover of Apollo. She bore him a son, [[Iamos]]. During the time of the childbirth, Apollo sent [[Eileithyia]], the goddess of childbirth to assist her.

[[Rhoeo]], a princess of the island of Naxos was loved by Apollo. Out of affection for her, Apollo turned her sisters into goddesses. On the island Delos she bore Apollo a son named [[Anius]]. Not wanting to have the child, she entrusted the infant to Apollo and left. Apollo raised and educated the child on his own.

Ourea, a daughter of [[Poseidon]], fell in love with Apollo when he and Poseidon were serving the Trojan king [[Laomedon]]. They both united on the day the walls of [[Troy]] were built. She bore to Apollo a son, whom Apollo named Ileus, after the city of his birth, Ilion ([[Troy]]). Ileus was very dear to Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Tzetzes]]' ''Exegesis in Iliadem'' 1.126 [= Hesiod ''Catalogue of Women'' fr. 83].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thero (mythology)|Thero]], daughter of [[Phylas]], a maiden as beautiful as the moonbeams, was loved by the radiant Apollo, and she loved him in return. By their union, she became mother of Chaeron, who was famed as "the tamer of horses". He later built the city [[Chaeronea]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyrie or Thyrie was the mother of [[Cycnus (son of Apollo)|Cycnus]]. Apollo turned both the mother and son into swans when they jumped into a lake and tried to kill themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'' [https://topostext.org/work/216#12 12]; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0074%3Abook%3D7%3Acard%3D350 7.350]; Smith 1873, [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DC%3Aentry+group%3D40%3Aentry%3Dcycnus-bio-1 s.v. Cycnus (1)].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hecuba]] was the wife of King [[Priam]] of [[Troy]], and Apollo had a son with her named [[Troilus]]. An [[oracle]] prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive. He was ambushed and killed by [[Achilleus]], and Apollo avenged his death by killing Achilles. After the sack of Troy, Hecuba was taken to Lycia by Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stesichorus]], Fr.108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coronis (lover of Apollo)|Coronis]] was daughter of [[Phlegyas]], King of the [[Lapiths]]. While pregnant with [[Asclepius]], Coronis fell in love with [[Ischys]], son of [[Elatus]] and slept with him. When Apollo found out about her infidelity through his prophetic powers or thanks to his [[Lycius (son of Clinis)|raven]] who informed him, he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis. Apollo rescued the baby by cutting open Koronis' belly and gave it to the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] to raise.

[[Dryope (daughter of Dryops)|Dryope]], the daughter of Dryops, was impregnated by Apollo in the form of a snake. She gave birth to a son named Amphissus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses,'' [https://topostext.org/work/216#32 32]; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0074%3Abook%3D9%3Acard%3D324 9.330].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Euripides]]' play ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'', Apollo fathered [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]] by [[Creusa (daughter of Erechtheus)|Creusa]], wife of [[Xuthus]]. He used his powers to conceal her pregnancy from her father. Later, when Creusa left Ion to die in the wild, Apollo asked [[Hermes]] to save the child and bring him to the oracle at [[Delphi]], where he was raised by a priestess.

Apollo loved and kidnapped an Oceanid nymph, [[Melia (consort of Apollo)|Melia]]. Her father [[Oceanus]] sent one of his sons, [[Caanthus]], to find her, but Caanthus could not take her back from Apollo, so he burned Apollo's sanctuary. In retaliation, Apollo shot and killed Caanthus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:9.10.5 9.10.5&amp;ndash;6].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male lovers===

[[File:Kiselev Death of Hyacinth.jpg|thumb|left|Death of [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]], by [[Alexander Kiselyov (painter)|Alexander Kiselyov]], 1850–1900]]

[[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]] (or Hyacinthus), a beautiful and athletic [[Sparta]]n prince, was one of Apollo's favourite lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D143 10.143 ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; The pair was practicing throwing the [[Discus throw|discus]] when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous [[Zephyrus]] and struck Hyacinthus in the head, killing him instantly. Apollo is said to be filled with grief. Out of Hyacinthus' blood, Apollo created a [[hyacinth (plant)|flower]] named after him as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection {{lang|grc|αἰαῖ}}, meaning ''alas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ai)ai{{=}}|αἰαῖ}}, {{LSJ|ai)/2|αἴ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was later resurrected and taken to heaven. The festival [[Hyacinthia]] was a national celebration of Sparta, which commemorated the death and rebirth of Hyacinthus.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1890, [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063:entry=hyacinthia-cn&amp;highlight=hyacinthus s.v. Hyacinthia].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another male lover was [[Cyparissus]], a descendant of [[Heracles]]. Apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a [[Pilum|javelin]] as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus was so saddened by its death that he asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo granted the request by turning him into the [[Cupressaceae|Cypress]] named after him, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0074%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D86 10.106-10.142]; Tripp, s.v. Cyparissus.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Granger-Apollo.jpg|thumb|200px|Apollo and [[Cyparissus]], by [[Jean-Pierre Granger]] (1779–1840)]]

[[Admetus]], the king of Pherae, was also Apollo's lover.&lt;ref&gt;[[Callimachus]], Hymn to Apollo, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Numa"&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Numa'', [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0052%3Achapter%3D4%3Asection%3D5 4.5].&lt;/ref&gt; During his exile, which lasted either for one year or nine years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keaveney|first=Arthur|date=1984-01-01|journal=Philologus|volume=128|issue=1–2|doi=10.1524/phil.1984.128.12.138|issn=2196-7008|title=A Note on Servius, Ad ''Aeneid'' 7, 637|pages=138–139|s2cid=164720549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo served Admetus as a herdsman. The romantic nature of their relationship was first described by [[Callimachus]] of Alexandria, who wrote that Apollo was "fired with love" for Admetus.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Plutarch lists Admetus as one of Apollo's lovers and says that Apollo served Admetus because he doted upon him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Amatorius'' 17&lt;/ref&gt; Latin poet [[Ovid]] in his [[Ars Amatoria]] said that even though he was a god, Apollo forsook his pride and stayed in as a servant for the sake of Admetus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' 2.239&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tibullus]] describes Apollo's love to the king as ''servitium amoris'' (slavery of love) and asserts that Apollo became his servant not by force but by choice. He would also make cheese and serve it to Admetus. His domestic actions caused embarrassment to his family.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tibullus]], ''Elegies'' 2.3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nicolas-Antoine Taunay - Apolo visitando Admeto.jpg|thumb|250px|Apollo visiting Admetus, by [[Nicolas-Antoine Taunay]], 19th century]]

{{blockquote| Oh how often his sister (Diana) blushed at meeting her brother as he carried a young calf through the fields!....often Latona lamented when she saw her son's disheveled locks which were admired even by Juno, his step-mother...&lt;ref&gt;Tibullus, ''Elegies'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;}}
When Admetus wanted to marry princess [[Alcestis]], Apollo provided a chariot pulled by a lion and a boar he had tamed. This satisfied Alcestis' father and he let Admetus marry his daughter. Further, Apollo saved the king from Artemis' wrath and also convinced the [[Moirai]] to postpone Admetus' death once.

[[Branchus]], a shepherd, one day came across Apollo in the woods. Captivated by the god's beauty, he kissed Apollo. Apollo requited his affections and wanting to reward him, bestowed prophetic skills on him. His descendants, the Branchides, were an influential clan of prophets.&lt;ref&gt;Pepin, Ronald E. (2008).

Other male lovers of Apollo include:

*[[Adonis]], who is said to have been the lover of both Apollo and Aphrodite. He behaved as a man with Aphrodite and as a woman with Apollo.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ptolemy Hephaestion, New History Book 4 (summary from Photius, Myriobiblon 190)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===

Apollo sired many children, from mortal women and nymphs as well as the goddesses. His children grew up to be physicians, musicians, poets, seers or archers. Many of his sons founded new cities and became kings. They were all usually very beautiful.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}

[[File:1590. Apollo Entrusting Chiron with the Education of Aescalapius - etching - Washington DC, NGA.jpg|thumb|Apollo Entrusting [[Chiron]] with the Education of Aescalapius]]

[[Asclepius]] is the most famous son of Apollo. His skills as a physician surpassed that of Apollo's. Zeus killed him for bringing back the dead, but upon Apollo's request, he was resurrected as a god. 
[[Aristaeus]] was placed under the care of Chiron after his birth. He became the god of beekeeping, cheese making, animal husbandry and more. He was ultimately given immortality for the benefits he bestowed upon the humanity. The [[Corybantes]] were spear-clashing, dancing demigods.

The sons of Apollo who participated in the Trojan War include the Trojan princes [[Hector]] and [[Troilus]], as well as [[Tenes]], the king of [[Tenedos]], all three of whom were killed by Achilles over the course of the war.

Apollo's children who became musicians and bards include [[Orpheus]], [[Linus of Thrace|Linus]], [[Ialemus]], [[Hymen (god)|Hymen]]aeus, [[Philammon]], [[Eumolpus]] and [[Eleuther]]. Apollo fathered 3 daughters, [[Apollonis]], [[Borysthenis]] and [[Cephisso]], who formed a group of minor Muses, the "Musa Apollonides". They were nicknamed Nete, Mese and Hypate after the highest, middle and lowest strings of his lyre.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}} [[Phemonoe]] was a seer and a poetess who was the inventor of Hexameter.

[[Apis (Greek mythology)|Apis]], [[Idmon]], [[Iamus]], [[Tenerus (son of Apollo)|Tenerus]], [[Mopsus]], [[Themisto (disambiguation)|Galeus]], Telmessus and others were gifted seers. [[Anius]], Pythaeus and [[Ismenus]] lived as high priests. Most of them were trained by Apollo himself.

[[Arabius (mythology)|Arabus]], [[Delphos (mythology)|Delphos]], [[Dryops (mythology)|Dryops]], [[Miletos]], [[Tenes]], [[Epidaurus (mythology)|Epidaurus]], Ceos, [[Lycorus|Lycoras]], [[Syrus]], Pisus, Marathus, Megarus, Patarus, [[Acraepheus]], Cicon, Chaeron and many other sons of Apollo, under the guidance of his words, founded eponymous cities.

He also had a son named Chrysorrhoas who was a mechanic artist.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Of the Names of Rivers and Mountains, and Of Such Things as are to be Found Therein''&lt;/ref&gt; His other daughters include [[Eurynome]], [[Chariclo]] wife of [[Chiron]], [[Eurydice]] the wife of Orpheus, [[Eriopis]], famous for her beautiful hair, [[Melite (heroine)|Melite]] the heroine, [[Pamphile]] the silk weaver, Parthenos, and by some accounts, Phoebe, Hilyra and [[Scylla]]. Apollo turned Parthenos into a constellation after her early death.

Additionally, Apollo fostered and educated [[Chiron]], the centaur who later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods, including Apollo's sons. Apollo also fostered [[Carnus]], the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]].

|[[Ptous]]&lt;ref&gt;Thus scholia on Paus. 9. 23. 6, with reference to [[Pindar]]. The relevant passage in Stephanus in fact reads: "Acraephia... was founded either by Athamas or by Acraepheus, son of Apollo. The mountain is named after Ptous, son of the aforesaid individual (τοῦ αὐτοῦ) and Euxippe". The version given in scholia on Pausanias has prompted several scholars to emend "Euxippe" to "Zeuxippe", and to assume that "τοῦ αὐτοῦ" refers to Apollo rather than Acraepheus. Such an interpretation, however, has been contested on the strength of the facts that Stephanus must have closely followed Herodianus, where the parents' names are unambiguously Acraepheus and Euxippe, and that the passage in scholia on Pausanias allows for an alternate understanding that doesn't necessarily make Apollo and Zeuxippe parents of Ptous. See ''[[Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft]]'', Band XXIII, Halbband 46, Psamathe-Pyramiden (1959), s. 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failed love attempts===

[[Marpessa (daughter of Evenus)|Marpessa]] was kidnapped by [[Idas]] but was loved by Apollo as well. [[Zeus]] made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D7%3Asection%3D8 1.7.8&amp;ndash;9]; cf. [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D9%3Acard%3D538 9.557&amp;ndash;560].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sinope (mythology)|Sinope]], a nymph, was approached by the amorous Apollo. She made him promise that he would grant to her whatever she would ask for, and then cleverly asked him to let her stay a virgin. Apollo kept his promise and went back.

[[Bolina]] was admired by Apollo but she refused him and jumped into the sea. To avoid her death, Apollo turned her into a nymph, saving her life.

[[Castalia]] was a [[nymph]] whom Apollo loved. She fled from him and dove into the [[castalian Spring|spring]] at Delphi, at the base of [[Mt. Parnassos]], which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Statius]], ''[[Thebaid (Latin poem)|Thebaid]]'' 1.696 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cassandra]], was a daughter of Hecuba and Priam. Apollo wished to court her. Cassandra promised to return his love on one condition - he should give her the power to see the future. Apollo fulfilled her wish, but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after. Angered that she broke her promise, Apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future, no one would ever believe her prophecies.

The [[Cumaean Sibyl|Sibyl of Cumae]] like Cassandra promised Apollo her love if he would give her a boon. The Sibyl took a handful of sand and asked Apollo to grant her years of life as many as the grains of sand she held in her hands. Apollo granted her wish, but Sibyl went back on her word. Although Sibyl did live an extended life as Apollo had promised, he did not give her agelessness along with it, so she shrivelled and shrank and only her voice remained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 14.129-154&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hestia]], the goddess of the hearth, rejected both Apollo's and Poseidon's marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried.

In one version of the prophet [[Tiresias]]'s origins, he was originally a woman who promised Apollo to sleep with him if he would give her music lessons. Apollo gave her her wish, but then she went back on her word and refused him. Apollo in anger turned her into a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Domitilla | last1 = Campanile | first2 = Filippo | last2 = Carlà-Uhink | first3 = Margherita | last3 = Facella | page =[https://books.google.com/books?id=39ENDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT57 57] | title = TransAntiquity: Cross-Dressing and Transgender Dynamics in the Ancient World | publisher = [[Routledge]] | date = February 23, 2017 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=39ENDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 9781138941205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female counterparts===

[[File:Gavin Hamilton - Apollo and Artemis, 1770.jpg|thumb|200px|Apollo and Artemis, by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]]|left]]

====Artemis====

[[File:Apollo Artemis Brygos Louvre G151.jpg|thumb|220px|Apollo (left) and [[Artemis]]. [[Brygos]] (potter signed), tondo of an Attic red-figure cup c. 470 BC, [[Musée du Louvre]].]]

Artemis as the sister of Apollo, is ''thea apollousa'', that is, she as a female divinity represented the same idea that Apollo did as a male divinity. In the pre-Hellenic period, their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife, and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described Artemis as the wife of Apollo.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}} However, this relationship was never sexual but spiritual,&lt;ref&gt;Eustath. ad Hom. p. 1197&lt;/ref&gt; which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the [[Hellenic period]].{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

Artemis, like her brother, is armed with a bow and arrows. She is the cause of sudden deaths of women. She also is the protector of the young, especially girls. Though she has nothing to do with oracles, music or poetry, she sometimes led the female chorus on Olympus while Apollo sang.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=lNV6-HsUppsC&amp;pg=PA268 s.v. Artemis, p. 268]&lt;/ref&gt; The laurel (''[[daphne]]'') was sacred to both. ''Artemis Daphnaia'' had her temple among the Lacedemonians, at a place called Hypsoi.&lt;ref&gt;G. Shipley, "The Extent of Spartan Territory in the Late Classical and Hellenistic Periods", ''The Annual of the British School at Athens'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Apollo Daphnephoros'' had a temple in [[Eretria]], a "place where the citizens are to take the oaths".&lt;ref&gt;Rufus B. Richardson, "A Temple in Eretria" ''The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts'', '''10'''.3 (July - September 1895:326–337); Paul Auberson, ''Eretria. Fouilles et Recherches I, Temple d'Apollon Daphnéphoros, Architecture'' (Bern, 1968). See also [[Plutarch]], ''Pythian Oracle'', 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In later times when Apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or [[Helios]], Artemis was naturally regarded as [[Selene]] or the moon.

====Hecate====

[[File:Jusepe de Ribera - Hecate, Procession to a Witches' Sabbath.jpg|thumb|Hecate's procession by the witches, by [[Jusepe de Ribera]]]]

[[Hecate]], the goddess of witchcraft and magic, is the chthonic counterpart of Apollo. They both are cousins, since their mothers - [[Leto]] and [[Asteria (Titaness)|Asteria]] - are sisters. One of Apollo's epithets, ''Hecatos'', is the masculine form of Hecate, and both the names mean "working from afar". While Apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven, Hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}} If Hecate is the "gate-keeper", Apollo ''Agyieus'' is the "door-keeper". Hecate is the goddess of crossroads and Apollo is the god and protector of streets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Carol M. Mooney, B.A., ''Hekate : Her Role And Character In Greek Literature From Before The Fifth Century B.C.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Houbraken, Arnold - Pallas Athene Visiting Apollo on the Parnassus - 1703.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|Pallas Athene Visiting Apollo on the Parnassus, by [[Arnold Houbraken]]]]

The oldest evidence found for Hecate's worship is at Apollo's temple in Miletos. There, Hecate was taken to be Apollo's sister counterpart in the absence of Artemis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Hecate's lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and contrasts and complements, at the same time, Apollo's solar nature.

====Athena====

As a deity of knowledge and great power, Apollo was seen being the male counterpart of [[Athena]]. Being Zeus' favorite children, they were given more powers and duties. Apollo and Athena often took up the role as protectors of cities, and were patrons of some of the important cities. Athena was the principle goddess of [[Athens]], Apollo was the principle god of [[Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://publicism.info/culture/apollo/7.html | title=APOLLO, THE YOUNG, AND THE CITY - KEY THEMES - Apollo - Fritz Graf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As patrons of arts, Apollo and Athena were companions of the [[Muses]], the former a much more frequent companion than the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dawkins, ''The Shakespeare Enigma''&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo was sometimes called the son of Athena and Hephaestus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' [https://archive.org/details/denaturadeorumac00ciceuoft/page/338/mode/2up?view=theater&amp;q=Apollo 3.22].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Trojan war, as Zeus' executive, Apollo is seen holding the [[aegis]] like Athena usually does.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D15%3Acard%3D281 15.308].&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo's decisions were usually approved by his sister Athena, and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;1.Homer, ''Iliad'', Euripides, ''Ion'', Aeschylus, ''Oresteia''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apollo in the ''Oresteia''===
In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'' trilogy, [[Clytemnestra]] kills her husband, King [[Agamemnon]] because he had sacrificed their daughter [[Iphigenia]] to proceed forward with the Trojan war. Apollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon's son, [[Orestes]], is to kill Clytemnestra and [[Aegisthus]], her lover. Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge, and consequently Orestes is pursued by the [[Erinyes]] or Furies (female personifications of [[revenge|vengeance]]).

Apollo and the Furies argue about whether the [[matricide]] was justified; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father, whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage. They invade his temple, and he drives them away. He says that the matter should be brought before Athena. Apollo promises to protect Orestes, as Orestes has become Apollo's [[Supplication|supplicant]]. Apollo advocates Orestes at the trial, and ultimately Athena rules in favor of Apollo.

===Roman Apollo===

The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=185}} As a quintessentially [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek god]], Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent, although later Roman poets often referred to him as '''Phoebus'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Koronis.html |title=Koronis |publisher=Theoi |access-date=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the [[Roman Kingdom|kings of Rome]] during the reign of [[Tarquinius Superbus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Liv.+1.56 1.56].&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE, Apollo's [[Temple of Apollo Sosianus|first temple]] at Rome was established in the Flaminian fields, replacing an older cult site there known as the "Apollinare".&lt;ref&gt;Livy [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0026:book=3:chapter=63 3.63.7], [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0145:book=4:chapter=25 4.25.3].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second Punic War]] in 212 BCE, the ''[[Ludi Apollinares]]'' ("Apollonian Games") were instituted in his honor, on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius.&lt;ref&gt;Livy [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0147:book=25:chapter=12 25.12].&lt;/ref&gt; In the time of [[Augustus]], who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J. H. W. G. Liebeschuetz |title=Continuity and Change in Roman Religion |year=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-814822-7 |pages=82–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=185}}

After the [[battle of Actium]], which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo, Augustus enlarged Apollo's temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted [[quinquennial]] games in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars#Life of Augustus|Augustus]]'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#18.2 18.2]; [[Cassius Dio]] [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/51*.html#1 51.1.1–3].&lt;/ref&gt; He also erected [[Temple of Apollo (Palatine)|a new temple]] to the god on the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine hill]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/53*.html#1.3 53.1.3].&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] formed the culmination of the [[Secular Games]], held in 17 BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' 5050, translated by {{cite book |last1=Beard |first1=Mary |author-link=Mary Beard (classicist) |last2=North |first2=John |last3=Price |first3=Simon |title=Religions of Rome: Volume 2: A Sourcebook |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-45015-7|page=5.7b }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
The chief Apollonian festival was the [[Pythian Games]] held every four years at Delphi and was one of the four great [[Panhellenic Games]]. Also of major importance was the [[Delia (festival)|Delia]] held every four years on Delos.
Athenian annual festivals included the [[Boedromia]], [[Metageitnia]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1890, [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0063%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DM%3Aentry+group%3D2%3Aentry%3Dmetageitnia-cn s.v. MACELLUM, MATRA'LIA, METAGEI'TNIA].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pyanepsia]], and [[Thargelia]].
Spartan annual festivals were the [[Carneia]] and the [[Hyacinthia]].
[[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] every nine years held the [[Daphnephoria]].

==Attributes and symbols==

Apollo's most common attributes were the bow and [[arrow]]. Other attributes of his included the [[kithara]] (an advanced version of the common [[lyre]]), the [[plectrum]] and the sword. Another common emblem was the [[sacrificial tripod]], representing his prophetic powers. The [[Pythian Games]] were held in Apollo's honor every four years at [[Delphi]]. The [[bay laurel]] plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the [[laurel wreath|crown of victory]] at these games.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=185}}

The [[palm tree]] was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in [[Delos]]. Animals sacred to Apollo included [[wolf|wolves]], dolphins, [[roe deer]], [[swan]]s, [[cicada]]s (symbolizing music and song), [[raven]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[Corvus (genus)|crow]]s (Apollo had hawks and crows as his messengers),&lt;ref name="Porphyry"/&gt; snakes (referencing Apollo's function as the god of prophecy), mice and [[griffin]]s, mythical eagle–lion hybrids of Eastern origin.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=185}}

[[Homer]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] wrote that Apollo had a hawk as his messenger.&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/3#15.493 Homer, ''Odyssey'', 15.493]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Porphyry"&gt;[http://cts.perseids.org/read/greekLit/tlg2034/tlg003/1st1K-grc1/3.5 Porphyry, ''De abstinentia'', 3.5]&lt;/ref&gt; In many myths Apollo is transformed into a hawk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/216#28 Antoninus Liberalis, ''Metamorphoses'', 28]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/141#6.103 Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'', 6.103]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/141#11.318 Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'', 11.318]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Claudius Aelianus]] wrote that in [[Egyptians|Ancient Egypt]] people believed that hawks were sacred to the god&lt;ref name="Aelian 10.14"/&gt; and that according to the ministers of Apollo in Egypt there were certain men called "hawk-keepers" (ἱερακοβοσκοί) who fed and tended the hawks belonging to the god.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0545.tlg001.perseus-grc1:7.9 Aelian, ''Characteristics of Animals'', 7.9]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius]] wrote that the second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of Apollo in Egypt and that the city's symbol is a man with a hawklike face ([[Horus]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/230#3.12.1 Eusebius, ''Preparation of the Gospels'', 3.12.1]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudius Aelianus]] wrote that Egyptians called Apollo [[Horus]] in their own language.&lt;ref name="Aelian 10.14"&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/560#10.14 Aelian, ''Characteristics of Animals'', 10.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apolocitaredo8.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Apollo Citharoedus]]'' ("Apollo with a kithara"), [[Musei Capitolini]], Rome]]

As god of colonization, Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, 750–550 BCE. According to Greek tradition, he helped [[Crete|Cretan]] or [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]]n colonists found the city of [[Troy]]. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts mention an Asia Minor god called ''Appaliunas'' or ''Apalunas'' in connection with the city of [[Wilusa]] attested in Hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek [[Troy|Ilion]] by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo's title of ''Lykegenes'' can simply be read as "born in Lycia", which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves (possibly a [[folk etymology]]).

In literary contexts, Apollo represents harmony, order, and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of [[Dionysus]], god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives [[Apollonian and Dionysian]]. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for [[Hyperborea]], he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus. This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the [[Borghese Vase]].

Apollo is often associated with the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|Golden Mean]]. This is the Greek [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of [[moderation]] and a [[virtue]] that opposes [[gluttony]].

In antiquity, Apollo was associated with the planet Mercury. The ancient Greeks believed that Mercury as observed during the morning was a different planet than the one during the evening, because each twilight Mercury would appear farther from the Sun as it set than it had the night before. The morning planet was called Apollo, and the one at evening Hermes/Mercury before they realised they were the same, thereupon the name 'Mercury/Hermes' was kept, and 'Apollo' was dropped.&lt;ref name=":merc"/&gt;

==Apollo in the arts==
[[File:7262 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - The Piraeus Apollo - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Piraeus Apollo]], archaic-style bronze, [[Archaeological Museum of Piraeus]]]]
Apollo is a common theme in Greek and Roman art and also in the art of the [[Renaissance]]. The earliest Greek word for a statue is "delight" ({{lang|grc|ἄγαλμα}}, ''agalma''), and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision. Greek art puts into Apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined. The sculptors derived this from observations on human beings, but they also embodied in concrete form, issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

The naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity. The muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for health, and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment. The statues of Apollo embody beauty, balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

===Archaic sculpture===
Numerous free-standing statues of male youths from [[Archaic Greece]] exist, and were once thought to be representations of Apollo, though later discoveries indicated that many represented mortals.&lt;ref&gt;Delphi, 467, 1524&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, V. I. Leonardos proposed the term ''[[kouros]]'' ("male youth") to refer to those from [[Keratea]]; this usage was later expanded by Henri Lechat in 1904 to cover all statues of this format.&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Leonardos(1895). ''Archaelogiki Ephimeris'', Col 75, n 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lechat (1904). ''La sculpture Attic avant Phidias'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo may be two figures from the [[Ionians|Ionic]] sanctuary on the island of [[Delos]]. Such statues were found across the Greek speaking world, the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of ''Apollo Ptoios'', [[Boeotia]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ducat (1971). ''Les Kouroi des Ptoion''.&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly more rare are the life-sized bronze statues. One of the few originals which survived into the present day—so rare that its discovery in 1959 was described as "a miracle" by Ernst Homann-Wedeking—is the masterpiece bronze, ''[[Piraeus Apollo]]''. It was found in [[Piraeus]], a [[port city]] close to Athens, and is believed to have come from north-eastern [[Peloponnesus]]. It is the only surviving large-scale Peloponnesian statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Homann-Wedeking|first=Ernst|url=https://archive.org/details/artofarchaicgree00homa|title=The Art of Archaic Greece|date=1968|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|pages=144–145|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical sculpture===

[[File:Apollon de Mantoue Louvre MA689.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Apollo of Mantua]], marble Roman copy after a 5th-century BCE Greek original attributed to [[Polykleitos]], Musée du Louvre]]
[[File:Runeberg ateneum apollon ja marsyas.jpg|thumb|180px|A marble sculpture of Apollo and [[Marsyas]] by [[Walter Runeberg]] at the arrivals hall of [[Ateneum]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]]]
The famous [[Apollo of Mantua]] and its variants are early forms of the Apollo Citharoedus statue type, in which the god holds the [[cithara]], a sophisticated seven-stringed variant of the lyre, in his left arm. While none of the Greek originals have survived, several Roman copies from approximately the late 1st or early 2nd century exist.

Other notable forms are the [[Apollo Citharoedus]] and the [[Apollo Barberini]].

===Hellenistic Greece-Rome===
Apollo as a handsome beardless young man, is often depicted with a cithara (as Apollo Citharoedus) or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree (the [[Apollo Lykeios]] and [[Apollo Sauroctonos]] types). The [[Apollo Belvedere]] is a [[marble]] sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of [[Classical Antiquity]] for Europeans, from the [[Renaissance]] through the 19th century. The marble is a [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] or Roman copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor [[Leochares]], made between 350 and 325 BCE.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

The life-size so-called "[[Adonis]]" found in 1780 on the site of a ''[[Roman villa|villa suburbana]]'' near the [[Via Labicana]] in the Roman suburb of Centocelle is identified as an Apollo by modern scholars. In the late 2nd century CE floor mosaic from [[El Djem]], Roman ''Thysdrus'', he is identifiable as [[Helios|Apollo Helios]] by his effulgent [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], though now even a god's divine [[nudity|nakedness]] is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later [[Roman Empire|Empire]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from [[Hadrumentum]], is in the museum at [[Sousse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |title=Mosaics in Tunisia: Apollo and the Muses |date=8 July 2008 |access-date=30 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708143541/http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |archive-date=8 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling [[Hairstyle|hair cut]] in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Bieber 1964, Yalouris 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed.

==Modern reception==
Apollo often appears in [[Modernity|modern]] and [[Greek mythology in popular culture|popular culture]] due to his status as the god of music, dance and poetry.

==== Dance and music ====
Apollo has featured in dance and music in modern culture. [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] composed a "Hymn of Apollo" (1820), and the god's instruction of the Muses formed the subject of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Apollon musagète]]'' (1927–1928). In 1978, the Canadian band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] released [[Hemispheres (Rush album)|an album]] with songs [[Cygnus X-1 Book II|"Apollo: Bringer of Wisdom"/"Dionysus: Bringer of Love"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cygnus X-1 Book Two: Hemispheres Lyrics {{!}} Rush.com|url=https://www.rush.com/songs/cygnus-x-1-book-two-hemispheres/|access-date=2021-04-24|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychology and philosophy ===
{{See also|Apollonian and Dionysian|Apollo archetype}}

In philosophical discussion of the arts, a distinction is sometimes made between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] impulses, where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2012-08-14 |title=Dionysus in Nietzsche and Greek Myth by Gwendolyn Toynton |url=http://www.primordialtraditions.net/prime/Library/DionysusinNietzscheandGreekMyth.aspx |access-date=2022-05-11 |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814164705/http://www.primordialtraditions.net/prime/Library/DionysusinNietzscheandGreekMyth.aspx |archive-date=14 August 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Carl Jung]]'s [[Apollo archetype]] represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional distance.&lt;ref&gt;Shinoda-Bolen, J., ''Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men's Lives and Loves'' p.130-160 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- SEE GREEK FORM OF NAME AND READ INTRODUCTION; DO NOT CHANGE 'GREEK'  TO 'ROMAN') --&gt;
In [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]], '''Pluto''' ({{lang-gr|Πλούτων}}, ''{{transliteration|el|Ploutōn}}'') was the ruler of the [[Greek underworld]]. The earlier name for the god was [[Hades]], which became more common as the name of the underworld itself. Pluto represents a more positive concept of the god who presides over the [[afterlife]]. ''Ploutōn'' was frequently [[conflation|conflated]] with [[Plutus|Ploûtos]], the Greek god of wealth, because mineral wealth was found underground, and because as a [[chthonic]] god Pluto ruled the deep earth that contained the seeds necessary for a bountiful harvest.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Hansen (classicist)|William Hansen]], ''Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Ploutōn'' came into widespread usage with the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], in which Pluto was venerated as both a stern ruler and a loving husband to [[Persephone]]. The couple received souls in the afterlife and are invoked together in religious inscriptions, being referred to as ''Plouton'' and as ''Kore'' respectively. Hades, by contrast, had few temples and religious practices associated with him, and he is portrayed as the dark and violent abductor of Persephone.

Pluto and [[Hades]] differ in character, but they are not distinct figures and share two dominant myths. In Greek [[cosmogony]], the god received the rule of the [[underworld]] in a three-way division of sovereignty over the world, with his brother [[Zeus]] ruling the sky and his other brother [[Poseidon]] sovereign over the sea. His central narrative in myth is of him abducting Persephone to be his wife and the queen of his realm.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Classical Mythology'',, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Plouton'' as the name of the ruler of the underworld first appears in [[ancient Greek literature|Greek literature]] of the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], in the works of the [[Theatre in ancient Greece|Athenian playwrights]] and of the philosopher [[Plato]], who is the major Greek source on its significance. Under the name Pluto, the god appears in other myths in a secondary role, mostly as the possessor of a [[quest]]-object, and especially in the descent of [[Orpheus]] or other [[Greek hero|heroes]] to the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Classical Mythology'', pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Plūtō'' ({{IPA-la|ˈpluːtoː|}}; [[genitive]] ''Plūtōnis'') is the [[Romanization|Latinized]] form of the Greek ''Plouton''. Pluto's [[interpretatio graeca|Roman equivalent]] is [[Dis Pater]], whose name is most often taken to mean "Rich Father" and is perhaps a direct translation of ''Plouton.'' Pluto was also identified with the obscure Roman [[Orcus]], like Hades the name of both a god of the underworld and the underworld as a place. ''Pluto'' (''Pluton'' in French and German, ''Plutone'' in Italian) becomes the most common name for the [[classical tradition|classical]] ruler of the underworld in subsequent [[Western culture|Western literature and other art forms]].

The name ''Plouton'' does not appear in [[ancient Greek literature|Greek literature]] of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Richard Farnell]], ''[[The Cults of the Greek States]]'' (Clarendon Press, 1907), vol. 3, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', the six children of [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] are [[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Poseidon]], [[Hades]], [[Demeter]], and [[Hestia]]. The male children divide the world into three realms. Hades takes Persephone by force from her mother [[Demeter]], with the consent of Zeus. ''Ploutos'', "Wealth," appears in the ''Theogony'' as the child of Demeter and [[Iasion]]: "fine Plutus, who goes upon the whole earth and the broad back of the sea, and whoever meets him and comes into his hands, that man he makes rich, and he bestows much wealth upon him." The union of Demeter and Iasion, described also in the ''[[Odyssey]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 5.125–128: ''And so it was when Demeter of the lovely hair, yielding / to her desire, lay down with Iasion and loved him / in a thrice-turned field'' (translation of [[Richmond Lattimore]]).&lt;/ref&gt; took place in a [[fallow]] field that had been ploughed three times, in what seems to be a reference to a [[hieros gamos|ritual copulation]] or [[sympathetic magic]] to ensure the earth's fertility.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Theogony'' 969–74; [[Apostolos Athanassakis|Apostolos N. Athanassakis]], ''Hesiod. Theogony, Works and Days, Shield'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1983, 2004), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; "The resemblance of the name ''Ploutos'' to ''Plouton'' ...," it has been noted, "cannot be accidental. Plouton is lord of the dead, but as Persephone's husband he has serious claims to the powers of fertility."&lt;ref&gt;Athanassakis, ''Hesiod'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Demeter's son Plutus merges in the narrative tradition with her son-in-law Pluto, redefining the implacable chariot-driver Hades whose horses trample the flowering earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emily Vermeule]], ''Aspects of Death in Early Greek Art and Poetry'' (University of California Press, 1979), pp. 37, 219; [[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], "The Origin of the ''Ludi Saeculares''," in ''Studies in Roman Literature, Culture and Religion'' (Brill, 1956), p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

That the underworld god was associated early on with success in agricultural activity is already evident in Hesiod's ''[[Works and Days]]'', line 465–469: "Pray to Zeus of the Earth and to pure Demeter to make Demeter's holy grain sound and heavy, when first you begin ploughing, when you hold in your hand the end of the plough-tail and bring down your stick on the backs of the oxen as they draw on the pole-bar by the yoke-straps."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hesiod|title=Works and Days|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg002.perseus-eng1:448-478|website=Perseus Digital Library|access-date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plouton and Ploutos ==
[[File:Dionysos Ploutos BM F68.jpg|thumb|Ploutos with the [[Cornucopia|horn of abundance]], in the company of [[Dionysos]] (4th century BC)]]
''Plouton'' was one of several [[euphemism|euphemistic]] names for Hades, described in the ''[[Iliad]]'' as the god most hateful to mortals.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Classical Mythology'', pp. 162 and 182, citing [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' 9.158–159. Euphemism is a characteristic way of speaking of divine figures associated with the dead and the underworld; Joseph William Hewitt, "The Propitiation of Zeus," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 19 (1908), p. 66, considers euphemism a form of [[propitiation]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] says that people prefer the name ''Plouton'', "giver of wealth," because the name of [[Hades]] is fear-provoking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' 403a; Glenn R. Morrow, ''Plato's Cretan City: A Historical Interpretation of the Laws'' (Princeton University Press, 1993), pp. 452–453.&lt;/ref&gt; The name was understood as referring to "the boundless riches of the earth, both the crops on its surface—he was originally a god of the land—and the mines hidden within it."&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Navarro Antolin, ''Lygdamus: Corpus Tibullianum III.1–6, Lygdami Elegiarum Liber'' (Brill, 1996), pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; What is sometimes taken as "confusion" of the two gods ''Plouton'' and ''Ploutos'' ("Wealth") held or acquired a theological significance in antiquity. As a lord of abundance or riches, Pluto expresses the aspect of the underworld god that was positive, symbolized in art by the "horn of plenty" ([[cornucopia]]),&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte R. Long, ''The Twelve Gods of Greece and Rome'' (Brill, 1987), p. 179; Phyllis Fray Bober, "Cernunnos: Origin and Transformation of a Celtic Divinity," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 55 (1951), p. 28, examples in Greek and Roman art in note 98; Hewitt, "The Propitiation of Zeus," p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; by means of which ''Plouton'' is distinguished from the gloomier Hades.&lt;ref&gt;Tsagalis, ''Inscribing Sorrow'', pp. 101–102; Morrow, ''Plato's Cretan City'', pp. 452–453; John J. Hermann, Jr., "Demeter-Isis or the Egyptian Demeter? A Graeco-Roman Sculpture from an Egyptian Workshop in Boston" in ''Jahrbuch des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts'' 114 (1999), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman poet [[Ennius]] (''ca.'' 239–169 BC), the leading figure in the [[Hellenization]] of [[Latin literature]], considered Pluto a Greek god to be explained in terms of the Roman equivalents Dis Pater and Orcus.&lt;ref&gt;''Pluto Latine est Dis pater, alii Orcum vocant'' ("In Latin, Pluto is Dis Pater; others call him Orcus"): [[Ennius]], ''Euhemerus'' frg. 7 in the edition of Vahlen = ''Var.'' 78 = E.H. Warmington, ''Remains of Old Latin'' (Heinemann, 1940), vol. 1, p. 421. The [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan poet]] [[Horace]] retains the Greek [[accusative]] form of the noun (''Plutona'' instead of Latin ''Plutonem'') at ''Carmen'' 2.14.7, as noted by John Conington, ''P. Vergili Maronis Opera'' (London, 1883), vol. 3, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether Pluto had a literary presence in Rome before Ennius. Some scholars think that rituals and beliefs pertaining to Pluto entered Roman culture with the establishment of the [[Saecular Games]] in 249 BC, and that ''Dis pater'' was only a translation of ''Plouton''.&lt;ref&gt;H.D. Jocelyn, ''The Tragedies of Ennius'' (Cambridge University Press, 1967), p. 331, with reference to [[Kurt Latte]], ''Römische Religionsgeschichte'' (C.H. Beck, 1967, 1992), p. 246ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1st century BC, [[Cicero]] identifies Pluto with Dis, explaining that "The earth in all its power and plenty is sacred to Father Dis, a name which is the same as ''Dives'', 'The Wealthy One,' as is the Greek ''Plouton''. This is because everything is born of the earth and returns to it again."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De natura deorum'' 2.66, translation of John MacDonald Ross (Penguin Books, 1972): ''Terrena autem vis omnis atque natura Diti patri dedicata est, qui dives, ut apud Graecos Πλούτων quia et recidunt omnia in terras et oriuntur e terris''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial era]], the Greek geographer [[Strabo]] (1st century AD) makes a distinction between Pluto and Hades. In writing of the mineral wealth of ancient [[Iberia]] ([[Hispania|Roman Spain]]), he says that among the [[Turdetani]], it is "Pluto, and not Hades, who inhabits the region down below."&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/3B*.html#9 3.2.9], citing [[Poseidonius]] as his source, who in turn cites [[Demetrius of Phalerum]] on the [[silver mine]]s of [[Attica]], where "the people dig as strenuously as if they expected to bring up Pluto himself" ([[Loeb Classical Library]] translation, in the [[LacusCurtius]] edition). The 16th-century mythographer [[Natale Conti]] describes Pluto's ''[[imperium]]'' as "[[Hispania#The Hispaniae|the Spains]] and all the places bordering the setting sun" (''Mythologiae'' 2.9, edition of 1651, p. 173; cf. Strabo 3.12).&lt;/ref&gt; In the discourse ''On Mourning'' by the Greek author [[Lucian]] (2nd century AD), Pluto's "wealth" is the dead he rules over in the [[Chaos (cosmogony)|abyss ''(chasma)'']]; the name ''Hades'' is reserved for the underworld itself.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''On Mourning'' (see [https://books.google.com/books?id=kmlJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Lucian+(of+Samosata.)%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hwEiTaXqB4_enQfNquShDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Greek text]); Peter Bolt, ''Jesus' Defeat of Death: Persuading Mark's Early Readers'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003) discusses this passage (pp. 126–127) and Greco-Roman concepts of the underworld as a context for [[Christian eschatology]] ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other identifications ===
In Greek religious practice, Pluto is sometimes seen as the "chthonic Zeus" (''Zeus Chthonios''&lt;ref&gt;Noel Robertson, ''Religion and Reconciliation in Greek Cities: The Sacred Laws of Selinus and Cyrene'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 102, citing passages from the ''Orphic Hymns'', throughout which ''Plouton'' is the ruler of the underworld, and Hades is the name of the place itself.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Zeus Catachthonios''&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, "The Propitiation of Zeus," p. 74, asserts that "Zeus Catachthonius seems certainly to be Pluto." Other deities to whom the title ''Katachthonios'' was affixed include Demeter, Persephone, and the Furies; Eugene Lane, "The Epithets of [[Men (god)|Men]]," ''Corpus monumentorum religionis dei Menis: Interpretation and Testimonia'' (Brill, 1976), vol. 3, p. 77, citing the entry on ''Katachthonioi'' in Roscher, ''Lexikon'' II, i, col. 998ff.&lt;/ref&gt;), or at least as having functions or significance equivalent to those of Zeus but pertaining to the earth or underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Zeus Chthonius and Pluto are seen as having "the same significance" in the ''[[Orphic Hymns]]'' and in the ''Dionysiaca'' of Nonnus (6.156ff.), by Hewitt, "The Propitiation of Zeus," p. 74, note 7. Overlapping functions are also suggested when [[Hesiod]] advises farmers to pray to "Zeus Chthonius and to holy Demeter that they may cause the holy corn of Demeter to teem in full perfection." This form of Zeus receives the black [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|victims]] typically offered to underworld deities.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] and [[Hellenistic religion]], Pluto was [[interpretatio graeca|identified with]] a number of other deities, including [[Summanus]], the Roman god of nocturnal thunder;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martianus Capella]], ''De Nuptiis'' 2.161.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Februus]], the Roman god from whose [[Februa|purification rites]] the [[Roman calendar|month of February]] takes its name and an Etruscans god of the underworld&lt;ref&gt;Capella, ''De nuptiis'' 2.149; [[Isidore of Seville]], ''Etymologies'' 5.33.4; [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], note to [[Vergil]]'s ''[[Georgics]]'' 1.43 (Vergil refrains from naming the god); [[John Lydus]], ''De mensibus'' 4.25.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[syncretism|syncretic]] god [[Serapis]], regarded as Pluto's [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian equivalent]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''De Iside'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/B.html 27] (361e): "In fact, men assert that Pluto is none other than Serapis and that Persephone is [[Isis]], even as [[Archemachus of Euboea]] has said, and also [[Heracleides Ponticus]] who holds the oracle in [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]] to be an oracle of Pluto" ([[Loeb Classical Library]] translation of 1936, [[LacusCurtius]] edition). Also spelled Sarapis. See Jaime Alvar, ''Romanising Oriental Gods: Myth, Salvation, and Ethics in the Cults of Cybele, Isis, and Mithras'', translated by Richard Gordon (Brill, 2008), pp. 53 [https://books.google.com/books?id=FH841IBf7mwC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=pluto&amp;lr=&amp;cd=11#v=onepage&amp;q=pluto&amp;f=false online] and 58; Hermann, "Demeter-Isis or the Egyptian Demeter?", p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mot (Semitic god)|Semitic god Muth]] (Μούθ). Muth was described by [[Philo of Byblos]] as the equivalent of both [[Thanatos]] (Death [[personification|personified]]) and Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''Praeparatio Evangelica'' [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pearse/morefathers/files/eusebius_pe_01_book1.htm 1.10.34], attributing this view to the semi-legendary Phoenician author [[Sanchuniathon]] via [[Philo of Byblos]]. In addition to asserting that Muth was equivalent to both [[Thanatos]] (Death [[personification|personified]]) and Pluto, Philo said he was the son of [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]. See entry on "Mot," ''[[Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible]]'', edited by [[Karel van der Toorn]], Bob Becking and [[Pieter Willem van der Horst]] (William B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999, 2nd ed.), p. 598, and ''Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide'', edited by Sarah Iles Johnston (Harvard University Press, 2004), p. 479. Philo's cosmogony as summarized by Eusebius bears some similarities to that of Hesiod and the Orphics; see [[Sanchuniathon#The history of the gods|Sanchuniathon's history of the gods]] and [[#Theogonies and cosmology|"Theogonies and cosmology" below.]] Philo said that these were reinterpretations of "Phoenician" beliefs by the Greeks.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greeks did not regard Pluto as "death" per se.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Classical Mythology'', p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-known myth involving Pluto or Hades is the abduction of Persephone, also known as Kore ("the Maiden"). The earliest literary versions of the myth are a brief mention in Hesiod's ''Theogony'' and the extended narrative of the ''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Demeter]];'' in both these works, the ruler of the underworld is named as Hades ("the Hidden One"). Hades is an unsympathetic figure, and Persephone's unwillingness is emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Rayor, ''The Homeric Hymns'' (University of California Press, 2004), pp. 107–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Increased usage of the name ''Plouton'' in religious inscriptions and literary texts reflects the influence of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], which treated Pluto and Persephone as a divine couple who received initiates in the afterlife; as such, Pluto was disassociated from the "violent abductor" of Kore.&lt;ref&gt;Christos Tsagalis, ''Inscribing Sorrow: Fourth-century Attic Funerary Epigrams'' (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2008), pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Two early works that give the abductor god's name as Pluto are the Greek [[mythography]] traditionally known as the [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|''Library'' of "Apollodorus"]] (1st century BC)&lt;ref&gt;Sources used to prepare this article uniformly refer to the ''Bibliotheca'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus as the ''Library'' of Apollodorus. Recent scholarship prefers to view the authorship of this work as anonymous; see [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the Latin ''Fables'' of [[Hyginus]] (''ca.'' 64 BC–AD 17).&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 146. The [[late antiquity|late-antique]] mythographer [[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius|Fulgentius]] also names the ruler of the underworld as Pluto, a practice continued by medieval mythographers.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential version of the abduction myth is that of [[Ovid]] (d. 17 or 18 AD), who tells the story in both the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (Book 5) and the ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'' (Book 4).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew D. Radford, ''The Lost Girls: Demeter-Persephone and the Literary Imagination, 1850–1930'' (Editions Rodopi, 2007), p. 24. For an extensive comparison of Ovid's two treatments of the myth, with reference to versions such as the ''Homeric Hymn to Demeter'', see Stephen Hinds, ''The Metamorphosis of Persephone: Ovid and the Self-Conscious Muse'' (Cambridge University Press, 1987), [https://books.google.com/books?id=o2o4ZiyIjmAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false limited preview online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Another major retelling, also in Latin, is the long unfinished poem ''De raptu Proserpinae'' ("On the Abduction of Proserpina") by [[Claudian]] (d. 404 AD). Ovid uses the name ''Dis'', not ''Pluto'' in these two passages,&lt;ref&gt;In Book 6 of the ''[[Aeneid]]'' (the [[catabasis]] of [[Aeneas]]), [[Vergil]] also names the ruler of the underworld more often as ''Dis'' than ''Pluto''.&lt;/ref&gt; and Claudian uses ''Pluto'' only once; translators and [[commentary (philology)|editors]], however, sometimes supply the more familiar "Pluto" when other epithets appear in the [[source text]].&lt;ref&gt;See also, for instance, J.J.L. Smolenaars, ''Statius. Thebaid VII: A Commentary'' (Brill, 1994), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gpDQnPv0HvIC&amp;dq=pluto+intitle%3AStatius+intitle%3AThebaid+intitle%3AVII&amp;q=pluto#v=snippet&amp;q=pluto&amp;f=false passim]'', or John G. Fitch, ''Seneca's 'Hercules Furens' ''(Cornell University Press, 1987), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=m4X_7m7ama4C&amp;dq=pluto+thanatos&amp;q=pluto+OR+plutonem+OR+plutone+OR+plutoni+OR+plutonis#v=snippet&amp;q=pluto%20OR%20plutonem%20OR%20plutone%20OR%20plutoni%20OR%20plutonis&amp;f=false passim]'', where the ruler of the underworld is referred to as "Pluto" in the English commentary, but as "Dis" or with other epithets in the Latin text.&lt;/ref&gt; The abduction myth was a popular subject for [[ancient Greek art|Greek]] and [[Roman art]], and recurs throughout Western art and literature, where the name "Pluto" becomes common (see [[#In Western art and literature|Pluto in Western art and literature]] below). Narrative details from Ovid and Claudian influence these later versions in which the abductor is named as Pluto, especially the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Cupid]] in manipulating Pluto with love and desire.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, ''The Lost Girls'', p. 22 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], and certainly by the time of [[Natale Conti]]'s influential ''Mythologiae'' (1567), the traditions pertaining to the various rulers of the classical underworld coalesced into a [[classical mythology|single mythology]] that made few if any distinctions among Hades, Pluto, Dis, and Orcus.

=== Offspring ===
Unlike his freely procreating brothers Zeus and Poseidon, Pluto is [[wikt:monogamous|monogamous]], and is rarely said to have children.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natale Conti]] observes (''Mythologiae'' 2.9, edition of 1651, p. 174) that before the abduction, Pluto was the only childless bachelor among the gods ''(solus omnium deorum coelibem et filiis carentem vitam traduceret)''. The [[nymph]] [[Minthe|Minthē]] was the concubine (''pallakis'', [[Strabo]] 8.3.14) of the ruler of the underworld under the name of Hades, but no ancient source records Pluto in this role; Conti, however, describes Minthē ''(Menthe)'' as the ''pellex'' of Pluto.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic texts]],&lt;ref&gt;Orphic fragments 197 and 360 (edition of Kern) and ''[[Orphic Hymns|Orphic Hymn]]'' 70, as cited by Helene P. Foley, ''Hymn to Demeter'' (Princeton University Press, 1994), p. 110, note 97.&lt;/ref&gt; the chthonic nymph [[Melinoe]] is the daughter of Persephone by Zeus disguised as Pluto,&lt;ref&gt;''Orphic Hymn'' 71.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Erinyes|Eumenides]] ("The Kindly Ones") are the offspring of Persephone and ''Zeus Chthonios'', often identified as Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Religion and Reconciliation in Greek Cities'', p. 102. Robertson holds that in the Orphic tradition, the Eumenides are distinguished from the Furies (Greek [[Erinyes]]). Vergil [[conflation|conflates]] the Eumenides and the [[Furies]], and elsewhere says that Night ''([[Nox (mythology)|Nox]])'' is their mother. [[Proclus]], in his [[commentary (philology)|commentary]] on the ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' of [[Plato]], provides passages from the Orphic ''Rhapsodies'' that give two different genealogies of the Eumenides, one making them the offspring of Persephone and Pluto (or Hades) and the other reporting a prophecy that they were to be born to Persephone and [[Apollo]] (Robertson, ''Religion and Reconciliation'', p. 101).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan poet]] [[Vergil]] says that Pluto is the father of the [[Furies]],&lt;ref&gt;When she had spoken these words, fearsome, she sought the earth: and summoned Allecto, the grief-bringer, from the house of the Fatal Furies, from the infernal shadows: in whose mind are sad wars, angers and deceits, and guilty crimes. A monster, hated by her own father Pluto, hateful to her Tartarean sisters: she assumes so many forms, her features are so savage, she sports so many black vipers. Juno roused her with these words, saying: 'Grant me a favour of my own, virgin daughter of Night, this service, so that my honour and glory are not weakened, and give way, and the people of Aeneas cannot woo Latinus with intermarriage, or fill the bounds of Italy(Aeneid 7.323 – Verg. A. 7.334 ). http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:phi,0690,003:7:337&lt;/ref&gt; but the mother is the goddess Nox ([[Nyx]]),&lt;ref&gt;Men speak of twin plagues, named the Dread Ones, whom Night bore untimely, in one birth with Tartarean Megaera, wreathing them equally in snaky coils, and adding wings swift as the wind.)." ( Aeneid 12. 845 – 12. 848 ff )&lt;/ref&gt; not his wife Persephone.The lack of a clear distinction between Pluto and "chthonic Zeus" confuses the question of whether in some traditions, now obscure, Persephone bore children to her husband. In the late 4th century AD, Claudian's epic on the abduction motivates Pluto with a desire for children. The poem is unfinished, however, and anything Claudian may have known of these traditions is lost.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, ''Hymn to Demeter'', p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Justin Martyr]] (2nd century AD) alludes to children of Pluto, but neither names nor enumerates them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin Martyr]], ''Apology'' [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iii.v.html 2.5]; see discussion of the context by David Dawson, ''Allegorical Readers and Cultural Revision in Ancient Alexandria'' (University of California Press, 1992), pp. 193–194.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] (5th century AD) mentions a "son of Pluto."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]], lexicon entry on Ἰσοδαίτης (''Isodaitês''), 778 in the 1867 edition of Schmidt.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 14th-century mythography, [[Boccaccio]] records a tradition in which Pluto was the father of the divine personification Veneratio ("Reverence"), noting that she had no mother because [[Proserpina]] (the Latin name of Persephone) was sterile.&lt;ref&gt;David Scott Wilson-Okamura, ''Virgil in the Renaissance'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 169, citing Boccaccio, ''[[Genealogia deorum gentilium]]'' 8.6; see also the Italian translation of 1644, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uQyMh91Ap2MC&amp;dq=pluto+OR+plutone+OR+pluton+inauthor%3ABoccaccio&amp;q=Veneratione#v=snippet&amp;q=Veneratione&amp;f=false p. 130.] Boccaccio cites Servius as his source, adding that [[Theodontius]] names the daughter of Pluto as Reverentia and says she was married to [[Honos]] ("Honor"). [[Macaria|Makaria]], "Blessedness," was a daughter of Hades, according to the [[Suda]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' (1590s), [[Edmund Spenser]] invents a daughter for Pluto whom he calls Lucifera.&lt;ref&gt;"Of griesly Pluto she the daughter was": [[Edmund Spenser]], ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', I.iv.11.1, as noted by G.W. Kitchin, ''Book I of The Faery Queene'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1879, 9th ed.), p. 180. In the 15th-century allegory ''[[The Assembly of Gods]]'' (lines 601–602), the figure of [[Vice]] personified is the bastard son of Pluto.&lt;/ref&gt; The character's name was taken from the 16th-century mythography of Natale Conti, who used it as the Latin translation of Greek ''phosphor'', "light-bearer," a regular epithet of [[Hecate]].&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Hamilton, ''The Spenser Encyclopedia'' (University of Toronto Press, 1990, 1997), p. 351, noting that Hecate is called a "phosphor", bringer of light, by [[Euripides]], ''Helen'' 569. The title ''Phosphoros'' is a common one for Hecate; Sarah Iles Johnston, ''Restless Dead: Encounters between the Living and the Dead in Ancient Greece'' (University of California Press, 1999), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Spenser incorporated aspects of the mysteries into ''The Faerie Queene''.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Brooks-Davies, entry on "Mysteries" in ''The Spenser Encyclopedia'', pp. 486–487.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pluto and Orpheus ===
[[File:Jan Brueghel (I) - Orpheus in the Underworld - WGA03564.jpg|thumb|300px|''Orpheus before Pluto and Proserpina'' (1605), by [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]].]]
[[Orpheus]] was regarded as a founder and prophet of the mysteries called "[[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]]," "[[Dionysian Mysteries|Dionysiac]]," or "[[Bacchanalia|Bacchic]]." Mythologized for his ability to entrance even animals and trees with his music, he was also credited in antiquity with the authorship of the lyrics that have survived as the ''[[Orphic Hymns]]'', among them a [[#Orphic Hymn to Pluto|hymn to Pluto]]. Orpheus's voice and lyre-playing represented a medium of revelation or higher knowledge for the mystery cults.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Calame, "The Authority of Orpheus, Poet and Bard: Between Tradition and Written Practice," in ''Allusion, Authority, and Truth: Critical Perspectives on Greek Poetic and Rhetorical Praxis'' (De Gruyter, 2010), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his central myth, Orpheus [[descent to the underworld|visits the underworld]] in the hope of retrieving his bride, [[Eurydice]], relying on the power of his music to charm the king and queen of Hades. Greek narratives of Orpheus's descent and performance typically name the ruler of the underworld as ''Plouton'', as for instance in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''.&lt;ref&gt;As accurately reflected by the translation of Michael Simpson, ''Gods and Heroes of the Greeks: The Library of Apollodorus'' (University of Massachusetts Press, 1976), pp. 13–15. Apollodorus consistently names the ruler of the underworld ''Plouton'' throughout, including the myths of his birth, tripartite division of sovereignty over the world, and the abduction.&lt;/ref&gt; The myth demonstrates the importance of Pluto "the Rich" as the possessor of a quest-object. Orpheus performing before Pluto and Persephone was a common subject of ancient and later Western literature and art, and one of the most significant mythological themes of the [[classical tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Miles, ''Classical Mythology in English Literature: A Critical Anthology'' (Routledge, 1999), p. 54ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The demonstration of Orpheus's power depends on the normal obduracy of Pluto; the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan poet]] [[Horace]] describes him as incapable of tears.&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]], ''Carmen'' 2.14.6–7, ''inlacrimabilem Plutona'' (Greek accusative instead of Latin ''Plutonem'').&lt;/ref&gt; Claudian, however, portrays the steely god as succumbing to Orpheus's song so that "with iron cloak he wipes his tears" ''(ferrugineo lacrimas deterget amictu)'', an image renewed by [[John Milton|Milton]] in ''[[Il Penseroso]]'' (106–107): "Such [[Music notes|notes]] ... / Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek."&lt;ref&gt;A.S.P. Woodhouse ''et al.'', ''A Variorum Commentary on the Poems of John Milton'' (Columbia University Press, 1972), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek writer [[Lucian]] (''ca.'' 125–after 180 AD) suggests that Pluto's love for his wife gave the ruler of the underworld a special sympathy or insight into lovers parted by death.&lt;ref&gt;In the dialogue ''Amatorius'' (Ἐρωτικός) [https://archive.org/details/ploutarchoutouc01dbgoog/page/n194 &lt;!-- pg=931 quote="soli amori plutonem". --&gt; 20], [[Plutarch]] says that the only god Hades listens to is [[Eros]]; the 17th-century classicist [[Daniel Clasen]], translating the ''Moralia'' into Latin, gives the god's name as Pluto, and in his mythographical work ''Theologia gentilis'' 2.4.6 includes this quality in his chapter on Pluto; see ''Thesaurus graecarum antiquitatum'' (Leiden, 1699), vol. 7, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of Lucian's ''Dialogues of the Dead'', Pluto questions [[Protesilaus]], the first Greek hero killed in the [[Trojan War]], who wishes to return to the world of the living. "You are then in love with life?", Pluto asks. "Such lovers we have here in plenty; but they love an object, which none of them can obtain." Protesilaus explains, like an Orpheus in reverse, that he has left behind a young bride whose memory even the [[Lethe]]'s waters of forgetting have not erased from him. Pluto assures him that death will reunite them someday, but Protesilaus argues that Pluto himself should understand love and its impatience, and reminds the king of his grant to Orpheus and to [[Alcestis]], who took her husband's place in death and then was permitted at the insistence of [[Heracles]] to return to him. When Persephone intercedes for the dead warrior, Pluto grants the request at once, though allowing only one day for the reunion.&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Dialogues of the Dead'' 23 (English translation from the 1820 edition of [[William Tooke]]; Jan Kott, ''The Eating of the Gods'' (Northwestern University Press, 1987), pp. 95–97. Lucian's dialogue has sometimes been referenced as a model for the premature loss of love between an active man carried suddenly into death and his young wife; see for instance Alfred Woltmann, ''[[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]] and His Times'' (London, 1872), p. 280, and [[Addison Peale Russell|A.P. Russell]], ''In a Club Corner: The Monologue of a Man Who Might Have Been Sociable'' (Houghton, Mifflin, 1890), pp. 78–79. The dialogue has also been seen as a [[burlesque]] of [[wikt:domesticity|domesticity]]; Betrand A. Goldgar, ''Henry Fielding: Miscellanies'' (Wesleyan University Press, 1993), vol. 2, p. xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mysteries and cult ==
[[File:Eleusinian hydria Antikensammlung Berlin 1984.46.jpg|thumb|[[Hydria]] (''ca.'' 340 BC) depicting figures from the Eleusinian Mysteries]]
As Pluto gained importance as an embodiment of agricultural wealth within the Eleusinian Mysteries, from the 5th century BC onward the name Hades was increasingly reserved for the underworld as a place.&lt;ref&gt;Tsagalis, ''Inscribing Sorrow'', p. 102. The shift may have begun as early as the 6th century. The earliest evidence of the assimilation of Hades and Ploutos/Plouton is a [[Phiale (libation vessel)|phiale]] by the [[Douris (vase painter)|Douris]] painter, dating to ''ca.'' 490 BC, according to Jan N. Bremmer, "W. Brede Kristensen and the Religions of Greece and Rome," in ''Man, Meaning, and Mystery: Hundred Years of History of Religions in Norway. The Heritage of W. Brede Kristensen'' (Brill, 2000), pp. 125–126. A point of varying emphasis is whether the idea of Plouton as a god of wealth was a later development, or an inherent part of his nature, owing to the underground storage of grain in the ''[[pithos|pithoi]]'' that were also used for burial. For a summary of these issues, see Cora Angier Sowa, ''Traditional Themes and the Homeric Hymns'' (Bolchazy-Carducci, 1984, 2005), p. 356, note 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Hades nor Pluto was one of the traditional [[Twelve Olympians]], and Hades seems to have received limited cult,&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, ''Plato's Cretan City'', p. 452; Long, ''The Twelve Gods'', p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps only at [[Elis (city)|Elis]], where the temple was opened once a year.&lt;ref name="Farnell"&gt;Farnell, ''The Cults of the Greek States'', p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; During the time of [[Plato]], the Athenians periodically honored the god called ''Plouton'' with the "strewing of a couch" ''([[lectisternium|tên klinên strôsai]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Long, ''The Twelve Gods'', p. 179. See [[lectisternium]] for the "strewing of couches" in ancient Rome. Two inscriptions from [[Attica]] record the names of individuals who participated in the ritual at different times: ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae|IG]]'' [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130823122309/http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/main II&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1933 and 1934], as cited by Robert Develin, ''Athenian Officials, 684–321 B.C.'' (Cambridge University Press, 1989, 2003), p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Eleusis]], ''Plouton'' had his own priestess.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas F. Jones, ''The Associations of Classical Athens: The Response to Democracy'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 125, citing ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae|IG]]'' II&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1363, dating ''ca.'' 330–270; Karl Kerényi, ''Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter'' (Princeton University Press, 1967), pp. 110–111.&lt;/ref&gt; Pluto was worshipped with Persephone as a divine couple at [[Knidos]], [[Ephesos]], [[Mytilene]], and [[Sparta]] as well as at Eleusis, where they were known simply as God ''([[wikt:θεός|Theos]])'' and Goddess ''(Thea)''.&lt;ref&gt;Tsagalis, ''Inscribing Sorrow'', pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ritual texts of the [[mystery religions]] preserved by the so-called [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] or [[Dionysian Mysteries|Bacchic]] [[Totenpass|gold tablets]], from the late 5th century BC onward&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Graf and Sarah Iles Johnston, ''Ritual Texts and the Afterlife'' (Routledge, 2007), first page (not numbered).&lt;/ref&gt; the name ''Hades'' appears more frequently than ''Plouton'', but in reference to the underground place:&lt;ref&gt;The recurring phrase "house of Hades" (῾Αΐδαο δόμος) can be read ambiguously as either the divine being or the place, or both. In the numbering of Graf and Johnston, ''Ritual Texts and the Afterlife'', "house of Hades" appears in Tablet 1, line 2 ([[Hipponion]], Calabria, [[Magna Graecia]], ''ca''. 400 BC), which refers again to Hades as a place ("what you are seeking in the darkness of murky Hades", line 9), with the king of the underworld (ὑποχθονίοι βασιλεϊ, ''hypochthonioi basilei'') alluded to in line 13; Tablet 2, line 1 (Petelia, present-day [[Strongoli]], Magna Graecia, 4th century BC); and Tablet 25 ([[Pharsalos]], [[Thessaly]], 350–300 BC). ''Hades'' is also discernible on the "carelessly inscribed" Tablet 38 from a Hellenistic-era grave in [[Hagios Athanasios]], near [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonike]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Plouton'' is the ruler who presides over it in a harmonious partnership&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Clinton, ''Myth and Cult: The Iconography of the Eleusinian Mysteries'' (Stockholm, 1992), p. 111, observing that this presentation in art contrasts with the earliest literary sources.&lt;/ref&gt; with Persephone.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Casadio and Patricia A. Johnston, "Introduction", ''Mystic Cults in Magna Graecia'' (University of Texas Press, 2009), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 4th century BC, the name ''Plouton'' appears in Greek metrical inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Tsagalis, ''Inscribing Sorrow'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Two fragmentary tablets greet Pluto and Persephone jointly,&lt;ref&gt;Tablets 15 ([[Eleutherae|Eleuthera]] 6, 2nd/1st century BC) and 17 ([[Rethymnon]] 1, from the early [[Roman Empire]], 25–40 AD), from [[Crete]], in the numbering of Graf and Johnston.&lt;/ref&gt; and the divine couple appear as welcoming figures in a metrical [[epitaph]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I know that even below the earth, if there is indeed a reward for the worthy ones,&lt;br /&gt;the first and foremost honors, nurse,&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes read as "father," as in the translation given by Alberto Bernabé and Ana Isabel Jiménez San Cristóbal, ''Instructions for the Netherworld: The Orphic Gold Tablets'' (Brill, 2008), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; shall be yours, next to Persephone and Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;Παρὰ Φερσεφόνει &lt;!--sic--&gt;Πλούτωνί τε: Tsagalis, ''Inscribing Sorrow'', pp. 100–101. Tsagalis discusses this inscription in light of the ''Homeric Hymn to Demeter'' and the [[Thesmophoria]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] identifies Pluto with [[Eubuleus|Eubouleus]],&lt;ref&gt;The entry in Hesychius reads: Εὐβουλεύς (sch. Nic. Al. 14) · ὁ Πλούτων. παρὰ δὲ τοῖς πολλοῖς ὁ Ζεὺς ἐν Κυρήνη (''Eubouleus: ho Ploutôn. para de toîs polloîs ho Zeus en [[Cyrene, Libya|Kyrene]]''), 643 (Schmidt).&lt;/ref&gt; but other ancient sources distinguish between these two underworld deities. In the Mysteries Eubouleus plays the role of a torchbearer, possibly a guide for the initiate's return.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Clinton, "The Mysteries of Demeter and Kore," in ''A Companion to Greek Religion'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), pp. 347–353.&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of [[Lewis Richard Farnell]], Eubouleus was originally a title referring to the "good counsel" the ruler of the underworld was able to give and which was sought at Pluto's [[#Sanctuaries of Pluto|dream oracles]]; by the 2nd century BC, however, he had acquired a separate identity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Richard Farnell]], ''The Cults of the Greek States'', vol. 3, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orphic Hymn to Pluto ===
The ''Orphic Hymn to Pluto'' addresses the god as "strong-spirited" and the "All-Receiver" who commands death and is the master of mortals. His titles are given as ''Zeus Chthonios'' and ''Euboulos'' ("Good Counsel").&lt;ref&gt;''Euboulos'' may be a cult title here and not the name of the god Eubuleus; elsewhere it is an epithet of the sea god [[Nereus]], perfect in his knowledge of truth and justice, and in his own Orphic hymn the guardian of the "roots" of the sea. See [[Pindar]], ''Pythian Ode'' 3.93; Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 233–236; ''Orphic Hymn'' 23; Athanassakis, ''Hesiod'', p. 52; Pierre Bonnechere, "Trophonius of Lebadea: Mystery Aspects of an Oracular Cult in Boeotia," in ''Greek Mysteries: The Archaeology and Ritual of Ancient Greek Secret Cults'' (Routledge, 2003, 2005), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; In the hymn's [[topography]], Pluto's dwelling is in [[Tartarus]], simultaneously a "meadow" and "thick-shaded and dark," where the [[Acheron]] encircles "the roots of the earth." ''Hades'' is again the name of the place, here described as "windless," and its gates, through which Pluto carried "pure Demeter's daughter" as his bride, are located in an [[Attica|Attic]] cave within the district of [[Eleusis]]. The route from Persephone's meadow to Hades crosses the sea. The hymn concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You alone were born to judge deeds obscure and conspicuous.&lt;br /&gt;Holiest and illustrious ruler of all, frenzied god,&lt;br /&gt;You delight in the worshiper's respect and reverence.&lt;br /&gt;Come with favor and joy to the initiates. I summon you.&lt;ref&gt;The translations of the ''Orphic Hymn to Pluto'' are from Apostolos N. Athanassakis, ''The Orphic Hymns'' (Scholars Press, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The hymn is one of several examples of Greco-Roman prayer that express a desire for the presence of a deity, and has been compared to a similar [[epiclesis]] in the ''[[Acts of Thomas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Act of Thomas'' 50, as cited and discussed by Susan E. Myers, ''Spirit Epicleses in the Acts of Thomas'' (Mohr Siebeck, 2010), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magic invocations ===
The names of both Hades and Pluto appear also in the [[Greek Magical Papyri]] and [[curse tablet]]s, with Hades typically referring to the underworld as a place, and Pluto regularly invoked as the partner of Persephone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Dieter Betz]], ''The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation'' (University of Chicago Press, 1986, 1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=K0hCj5u3HNQC&amp;dq=hades+intitle%3Agreek+intitle%3Amagical+intitle%3APapyri&amp;q=hades#v=snippet&amp;q=hades&amp;f=false passim]; John G. Gager, ''Curse Tablets and Binding Spells from the Ancient World'' (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 12 (examples invoking Pluto pp. 99, 135, 143–144, 207–209) and ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rmhw2eVJnS0C&amp;dq=pluto+OR+pluton+OR+plouton+OR+plutonius+intitle%3Acurse+inauthor%3AGager&amp;q=hades#v=snippet&amp;q=hades&amp;f=false passim]'' on Hades.&lt;/ref&gt; Five Latin curse tablets from Rome, dating to the mid-1st century BC, promise Persephone and Pluto an offering of "[[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]], [[Common fig#Cultural aspects|figs]], and a black [[Cultural references to pigs#In religion|pig]]" if the curse is fulfilled by the desired deadline. The pig was a characteristic [[animal sacrifice]] to chthonic deities, whose [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|victims]] were almost always black or dark in color.&lt;ref&gt;Bolt, ''Jesus' Defeat of Death'', p. 152; John Scheid, "Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors", in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

A set of curse tablets written in [[Doric Greek]] and found in a tomb addresses a Pasianax, "Lord to All,"&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Ogden, ''Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 212, with English translation of the curse.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes taken as a title of Pluto,&lt;ref&gt;Gager, ''Curse Tablets'', p. 131, with translations of both tablets, and note 35.&lt;/ref&gt; but more recently thought to be a magical name for the corpse.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Collins, ''Magic in the Ancient Greek World'' (Blackwell, 2008), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pasianax'' is found elsewhere as an epithet of Zeus, or in the tablets may invoke a ''[[daimon]]'' like [[Abrasax]].&lt;ref&gt;Esther Eidinow, "Why the Athenians Began to Curse," in ''Debating the Athenian Cultural Revolution: Art, Literature, Philosophy and Politics 430–380 BC'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 50; Ogden, ''Magic, Withcraft, and Ghosts'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sanctuaries of Pluto ===
{{Main|Ploutonion}}
A sanctuary dedicated to Pluto was called a [[ploutonion]] (Latin ''plutonium''). The complex at [[Eleusis]] for the mysteries had a ploutonion regarded as the birthplace of the divine child Ploutos, in another instance of conflation or close association of the two gods.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Dietrich, "The Religious Prehistory of Demeter's Eleusinian Mysteries," in ''La soteriologia dei culti orientali nell' Impero Romano'' (Brill, 1982), p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inscriptiones Graecae|Greek inscriptions]] record an altar of Pluto, which was to be "plastered", that is, resurfaced for a new round of sacrifices at Eleusis.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Religion and Reconciliation'', p. 163 [https://books.google.com/books?id=5pyER-1-8VcC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=%22altar+of+pluto%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-rIgTd_LH4SHnAfYvLyVDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22altar%20of%20pluto%22&amp;f=false online], citing ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae|IG]]'' 1&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;356.155 and ''IG'' 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1672.140; see also ''The Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore: Topography and Architecture'' (American School of Classical Studies, 1997), p. 76, note 31.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the known ploutonia was in the [[sacred grove]] between [[Tralleis]] and [[Nysa (Caria)|Nysa]], where a temple of Pluto and Persephone was located. Visitors sought healing and [[incubation (ritual)|dream oracles]].&lt;ref&gt;Strabo [https://books.google.com/books?id=lfMrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=ploutonion+OR+plutonion+OR+plutonium+inauthor:Strabo&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=ploutonion%20OR%20plutonion%20OR%20plutonium%20inauthor%3AStrabo&amp;f=false 14.1.44]; "Summaries of Periodicals," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 7 (1891), p. 209; Hewitt, "The Propitiation of Zeus," p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The ploutonion at [[Hierapolis]], [[Phrygia]], was connected to the rites of [[Cybele]], but during the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial era]] was subsumed by the cult of [[Apollo]], as confirmed by archaeological investigations during the 1960s. It too was a dream oracle.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick E. Brenk, "Jerusalem-Hierapolis. The Revolt under Antiochos IV Epiphanes in the Light of Evidence for Hierapolis of Phrygia, Babylon, and Other Cities," in ''Relighting the Souls: Studies in Plutarch, in Greek Literature, Religion, and Philosophy, and in the New Testament Background'' (Franz Steiner, 1998), pp.  382–384, citing [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], ''Life of Isidoros'' 131 on the dream.&lt;/ref&gt; The sites often seem to have been chosen because the presence of naturally occurring [[wikt:mephitic air|mephitic vapors]] was thought to indicate an opening to the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Sourvinou-Inwood, "Reconstructing Change: Ideology and the Eleusinian Mysteries," in ''Inventing Ancient Culture: Historicism, Periodization and the Ancient World'' (Routledge, 1997), p. 137; [[Georg Luck]], ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2006, 2nd ed.), p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, [[Avernus]] was considered an entrance to the underworld that produced toxic vapors, but Strabo seems not to think that it was a ploutonion.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo C244–6, as cited by Daniel Ogden, ''Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Sourcebook'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), pp. 190 –191.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconography and attributes ==
[[File:Persephone Hades BM Vase E82.jpg|thumb|Hades and Persephone: tondo of an Attic red-figured [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]], ca. 440–430&amp;nbsp;BC]]

=== In Eleusinian scenes ===
Kevin Clinton attempted to distinguish the iconography of Hades, Plouton, Ploutos, and the Eleusinian ''Theos'' in 5th-century [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase painting]] that depicts scenes from or relating to the mysteries. In Clinton's schema, Plouton is a mature man, sometimes even white-haired; Hades is also usually bearded and mature, but his darkness is emphasized in literary descriptions, represented in art by dark hair. Plouton's most common attribute is a [[sceptre]], but he also often holds a full or overflowing cornucopia; Hades sometimes holds a horn, but it is depicted with no contents and should be understood as a [[drinking horn]]. Unlike Plouton, Hades never holds agrarian attributes such as stalks of grain. His chest is usually bare or only partly covered, whereas Plouton is fully robed (exceptions, however, are admitted by the author). Plouton stands, often in the company of both Demeter and Kore, or sometimes one of the goddesses, but Hades almost always sits or reclines, usually with Persephone facing him.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Clinton, ''Myth and Cult: The Iconography of the Eleusinian Mysteries'' (Stockholm, 1992), pp. 105. As Clinton notes (p. 107), the ''[[Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae]]'' does not distinguish between Hades and Plouton, and combines evidence for either in a single entry. The only vase to label the Eleusinian ''Theos'' with an inscription is a red-figured footed ''[[dinos]]'' in the collections of the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]], attributed to the [[Syleus Painter]]. The main scene is the departure of [[Triptolemos]], with Demeter on the left and Persephone as ''Pherephata'' ([Φε]ρ[ε]φάτα) on the right. ''Theos'' wears a [[himation]] over a spangled tunic with decorated hem (Clinton, p. 106).&lt;/ref&gt; "Confusion and disagreement" about the interpretation of these images remain.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine M. Keesling, "Endoios's Painting from the Themistoklean Wall: A Reconstruction," ''Hesperia'' 68.4 (1999), p. 544, note 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The keys of Pluto ===

Attributes of Pluto mentioned in the ''Orphic Hymn to Pluto'' are his [[scepter]], keys, throne, and horses. In the hymn, the keys are connected to his capacity for giving wealth to humanity, specifically the agricultural wealth of "the year's fruits."

[[File:Agostino Carracci 01.jpg|thumb|''Pluto'' (1592) by [[Agostino Carracci]], probably influenced by the description in [[Vincenzo Cartari]]'s mythography,&lt;ref&gt;Clare Robertson ''et al.'', ''Drawings by the Carracci from British Collections'' (Ashmolean Museum, 1996), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; with the god holding his scepter and key, [[Cerberus]] at his side]]
[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] explains the significance of Pluto's key in describing a wondrously carved cedar chest at the Temple of [[Hera]] in Elis. Numerous deities are depicted, with one panel grouping Dionysus, Persephone, the [[nymph]]s and Pluto. Pluto holds a key because "they say that what is called Hades has been locked up by Pluto, and that nobody will return back again therefrom."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 5.20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natale Conti]] cites Pausanias in noting that keys are an attribute of Pluto as the scepter is of [[Jove]] (Greek Zeus) and the [[trident]] of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] (Poseidon).&lt;ref&gt;Natale Conti, ''Mythologiae'' 2.9, edition of 1651, pp. 173–174.&lt;/ref&gt;

A golden key ''(chrusea klês)'' was laid on the tongue of initiates by priests at Eleusis&lt;ref&gt;[[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' 1051 ("Rites they to none betray, / Ere on his lips is laid / Secrecy's golden key / By their own acolytes, / Priestly [[Eumolpidae]]," in the 1912 translation of F. Storr), as cited by [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], introduction to ''Mythology and Monuments of Ancient Athens'', a translation of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] by Margaret de G. Verrall (London, 1890), pp. liv–lv. It is unclear whether a literal key is meant, or a [[Charon's obol#'Ghost' coins and crosses|golden ''lamella'']] ([[Totenpass]]).&lt;/ref&gt; and was a symbol of the revelation they were obligated to keep secret.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Turcan, ''Les religions de l'Asie dans la vallée du Rhône'' (Brill, 1972), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; A key is among the attributes of other infernal deities such as [[Hecate]], [[Anubis]], and Persephone, and those who act as guardians or timekeepers, such as [[Janus]] and [[Aeon|Aion]].&lt;ref&gt;Turcan, ''Les religions de l'Asie'', pp. 23–26. Both Persephone (as Persephassa and "Kore out of Tartaros") and Anubis are key-holders throughout the ''[[Greek Magical Papyri]]''. [[Jesus]] Christ, as the conqueror of death and Hades, holds keys in the [[Book of Revelation]] 1:18; see Walter A. Elwell and Philip W. Comfort, ''Tyndale Bible Dictionary'' (Tyndale, 2001), p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aeacus]] ''(Aiakos)'', one of the three mortal kings who became [[Divine judgment#Greco-Roman beliefs|judges in the afterlife]], is also a ''kleidouchos'' (κλειδοῦχος), "holder of the keys," and a priestly doorkeeper in the court of Pluto and Persephone.&lt;ref&gt;For extensive notes on Aiakos, see Radcliffe Guest Edmonds, ''Myths of the Underworld Journey: Plato, Aristophanes, and the 'Orphic' Gold Tablets'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 148, note 116. As a possessor of keys, he appears in Apollodorus 3.12.6, ''[[Greek Magical Papyri|PGM]]'' IV.1264, and inscriptions.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vegetation and color ===
According to the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Lucius Annaeus Cornutus|Cornutus]] (1st century AD), Pluto wore a wreath of ''phasganion'', more often called ''xiphion'',&lt;ref&gt;Ancient sources on ''phasganion'', ''xiphion'' and ''gladiolus'', generally called "corn-flag" by [[History of botany|historical botanists]], include [[Theophrastus]], ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]'' 7.12.3; [[Dioscorides]], [[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|''De Materia Medica'']] ''E'' 2.101; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 21.107–115; [[Pseudo-Apuleius]], ''Herbarius'' 79, as cited by Andrew Dalby, ''Food in the Ancient World from A to Z'' (Routledge, 2003), p. 105, characterizing Pliny's entry on the plant as "confused." The correspondence of ancient plant names to modern species is always uncertain. Both the Greek ''xiphion'' and the Latin word ''gladiolus'' ("little sword") come from a word meaning "sword."&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally identified as a type of [[gladiolus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nouveau dictionnaire d'histoire naturelle'' (Paris, 1819), pp. 315–316; Julius Billerbeck, ''Flora classica'' (Leipzig, 1824), p. 13; "L'origine dei maccheroni," ''Archivo per lo studio delle tradizioni popolari'' 17 (1898), vol. 36, p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dioscorides]] recorded medical uses for the plant. For extracting [[stinger|stings]] and [[thorn (botany)|thorns]], ''xiphion'' was mixed with wine and [[frankincense]] to make a [[cataplasm]]. The plant was also used as an [[aphrodisiac]]&lt;ref&gt;Francis Adams, ''The Seven Books of [[Paulus Aegineta]]'' (London, 1847), p. 270; Dalby, ''Food in the Ancient World'', p. 105; ''Nouveau dictionnaire d'histoire naturelle'', p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Birth control#Ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt and Rome|contraceptive]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John M. Riddle]], ''Contraception and Abortion from the Ancient World to the Renaissance'' (Harvard University Press, 1992), p. 42; ''Nouveau dictionnaire d'histoire naturelle'', p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; It grew in humid places. In an obscure passage, Cornutus seems to connect Pluto's wearing of ''phasganion'' to an etymology for [[Avernus]], which he derives from the word for "air," perhaps through some association with the color ''glaukos'', "bluish grey," "greenish" or "sea-colored," which might describe the plant's leaves. Because the color could describe the sky, Cornutus regularly gives it divine connotations.&lt;ref&gt;P.G. Maxwell-Stuart, ''Studies in Greek Colour Terminology: ΓΛΑΥΚΟΣ'' (Brill, 1981), vol. 1, pp. 40, 42, citing Cornutus, ''Theologiae Graecae Compendium'' 9, 20, 35. The word γλαυκότης ''(glaukotēs)'', however, is a [[textual criticism|textual crux]] in the passage pertaining to Pluto.&lt;/ref&gt; Pluto's twin sister was named [[#Euhemerism and Latinization|Glauca]].

Ambiguity of color is characteristic of Pluto. Although both he and his realm are regularly described as dark, black, or gloomy, the god himself is sometimes seen as pale or having a pallor. [[Martianus Capella]] (5th century) describes him as both "growing pale in shadow, a fugitive from light" and actively "shedding darkness in the gloom of [[Tartarus|Tartarean]] night," crowned with a wreath made of [[ebony]] as suitable for the kingdom he governs.&lt;ref&gt;''Lucifuga inumbratione pallescens'' and ''Tartareae noctis obscuritate furvescens'', [[Martianus Capella]], ''De nuptiis'' 1.79–80; Danuta Shanzer, ''A Philosophical and Literary Commentary on Martianus Capella's'' De Nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'' Book 1'' (University of California Press, 1986), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The horses of Pluto are usually black, but Ovid describes them as "sky-colored" (''caeruleus'', from ''[[Caelus|caelum]]'', "sky"), which might be blue, greenish-blue, or dark blue.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'' 4.446, as cited John G. Fitch, ''Seneca's ''Hercules furens'': A Critical Text with Introduction and Commentary'' (Cornell University Press, 1987), p. 166, note to Seneca's identical description of the horses of the Sun (line 132). Ovid describes the horses as black ''(ater)'' in his version of the abduction myth in the ''Metamorphoses'', 5.310. On the color ''caeruleus,'' see also Hendrik Wagenvoort, "Caerimonia," in ''Studies,'' pp. 98–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spring in London (7116603849).jpg|thumb|The [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]], frequently linked to the myth of Persephone, who was snatched into the Underworld by the god Hades while picking the flowers]]
The [[Renaissance]] mythographer [[Natale Conti]] says wreaths of [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]], [[Adiantum|maidenhair fern ''(adianthus)'']]&lt;!--adianthus is the form used by Conti, not adiantum--&gt;, and [[cupressus sempervirens|cypress]] were given to Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;Natale Conti, ''Mythologiae'' 2.9. Conti's sources on this point are unclear, and he thoroughly conflates traditions pertaining to the various classical rulers of the underworld.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Homeric Hymn to Demeter'', [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Earth) produced the narcissus at Zeus's request as a snare for Persephone; when she grasps it, a chasm opens up and the "Host to Many" (Hades) seizes her.&lt;ref&gt;''Homeric Hymn to Demeter'', lines 7–9, as cited by Radford, ''Lost Girls'', p. 145; Clayton Zimmerman, ''The Pastoral Narcissus: A Study of the First Idyll of Theocritus'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1994), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Narcissus wreaths were used in early times to crown Demeter and Persephone, as well as the Furies ([[Erinyes|Eumenides]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sophocles, ''Oedipus at Colonus'' 681, and [[scholion]], on Demeter and Persephone (the two "Great Goddesses"); [[Euphorion of Chalcis|Euphorion]], fragment 94, on the Eumenides; Zimmerman, ''The Pastoral Narcissus'', p. 2; Jan Coenradd Kamerbeek, ''The Plays of Sophocles, Commentaries: The Oedipus Colonus'' (Brill, 1984), vol. 7, p. 106, noting that garlands of flowers were expressly forbidden at the [[Thesmophoria]]; James C. Hogan, ''A Commentary on the Plays of Sophocles'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1991), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The flower was associated with narcotic drugginess (''narkê'', "torpor"),&lt;ref&gt;"Death and Greek Myths," in ''Greek and Egyptian Mythologies'', edited by Yves Bonnefoy (University of Chicago Press, 1991, 1992), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; [[fascinus|erotic fascination]],&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, ''The Pastoral Narcissus'', p. 2; Carlin A. Barton, ''The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster'' (Princeton University Press, 1993), p. 92. The [[phallus]] as a magic charm was the remedy for ''[[invidia]]'' or the evil eye, a self-induced form of which was the ruin of [[Narcissus (mythology)|the mythological figure Narcissus]].&lt;/ref&gt; and imminent death;&lt;ref&gt;On the difficulty of identifying precisely which flower the ancients meant by "narcissus," see [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb|R.C. Jebb]], ''Sophocles: The Plays and Fragments'' (Cambridge University Press, 1900, 3rd edition), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; to dream of crowning oneself with narcissus was a bad sign.&lt;ref&gt;[[Artemidorus]], ''[[Oneirocritica]]'' 1.77, as noted by Jebb, ''Sophocles'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Narcissus (mythology)|myth of Narcissus]], the flower is created when a beautiful, self-absorbed youth rejects sexuality and is condemned to perpetual self-love along the [[Styx]].&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 3.505; Zimmerman, ''The Pastoral Narcissus'', p. 48. The Styx here is a pool.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conti's inclusion of ''adianthus'' (''[[Adiantum]]'' in modern nomenclature) is less straightforward. The name, meaning "unmoistened" (Greek ''adianton''), was taken in antiquity to refer to the fern's ability to repel water. The plant, which grew in wet places, was also called ''[[Adiantum capillus-veneris|capillus veneris]]'', "hair of Venus," divinely dry when she emerged from the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus, ''Historia plantarum'' 7.13–14; [[Nicander]], ''[[Theriaca (poem)|Theriaca]]'' 846; [[Rabelais]], ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' 4.24; Adams, ''The Seven Books of Paulus Aegineta'', pp. 22–23; Richard Hunter, ''Theocritus: A Selection'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 277, noting that "the association of lush vegetation ... with female 'otherness' and sexuality has a long history."&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of medicine|Historian of medicine]] [[John M. Riddle]] has suggested that the ''adianthus'' was one of the ferns Dioscorides called ''[[asplenium|asplenon]]'' and prescribed as a contraceptive ''(atokios)''.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle, ''Contraception and Abortion'', pp. 31, 82, 180 (note 5).&lt;/ref&gt; The associations of Proserpine (Persephone) and the maidenhair are alluded to by [[Samuel Beckett]] in a 1946 poem, in which the [[self]] is a [[Allegory of the Cave|Platonic cave]] with ''[[:fr:capillaire|capillaires]]'',&lt;!-- this link is a dab page on wikipédia.fr; please do not change, as the ambiguity of meaning is deliberate and an accurate representation of the intentions of the source text--&gt; in French both "maidenhair fern" and "[[blood vessel]]s".&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Beckett]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=DFUc5K_J6JQC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=%22Jusque+dans+la+caverne+ciel+et+sol%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KLdQzIShWu&amp;sig=4kirRjpJ3aQy8iId2ARRFb78v90&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gi-FTa_GKanE0QHppr3KBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jusque%20dans%20la%20caverne%20ciel%20et%20sol%22&amp;f=false "Jusque dans la caverne ciel et sol"], the last of twelve poems in the cycle ''Poèmes 38–39'' (1946); C.J. Ackerley and S.E. Gontarski, ''The Grove Companion to Samuel Beckett'' (Grove Press, 2004), pp. 293, 443, 599.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cypress (Greek ''cyparissus'', Latin ''cupressus'') has traditional associations with mourning.&lt;ref&gt;Bernabé and Jiménez San Cristóbal, ''Instructions for the Netherworld'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient [[Attica]], households in mourning were garlanded with cypress,&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 3.680.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was used to fumigate the air during [[cremation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isidore of Seville]], ''[[Etymologiae]]'' 17.7.34.&lt;/ref&gt; In the myth of [[Cyparissus]], a youth was transformed into a cypress, consumed by grief over the accidental death of a pet [[Red Deer|stag]].&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 10.106ff.; Servius, note to Vergil's ''[[Georgics]]'' 1.20.&lt;/ref&gt; A "white cypress" is part of the topography of the underworld that recurs in the [[Totenpass|Orphic gold tablets]] as a kind of beacon near the entrance, perhaps to be compared with the [[Tree of Life]] in various world mythologies. The description of the cypress as "white" (Greek ''leukē''), since the botanical tree is dark, is symbolic, evoking the white garments worn by initiates or the clothing of a corpse, or the pallor of the dead. In Orphic funeral rites, it was forbidden to make coffins of cypress.&lt;ref&gt;Bernabé and Jiménez San Cristóbal, ''Instructions for the Netherworld'', pp. 25–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of the mystery religions favors Pluton/Hades as a loving and faithful partner to Persephone, but one ancient myth that preserves a lover for him parallels the abduction and also has a vegetative aspect.&lt;ref&gt;The nymph [[Minthe|Minthē]], a rival for the attentions of ''Hades'' (not named as Pluto), was transformed by Persephone into the mint plant, a major ingredient in the ritual drink of the mysteries ([[Strabo]] 8.3.14).&lt;/ref&gt; A Roman source says that Pluto fell in love with [[Leuce (mythology)|Leuca]] (Greek ''Leukē'', "White"), the most beautiful of the nymphs, and abducted her to live with him in his realm. After the long span of her life came to its end, he memorialized their love by creating a white tree in the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]]. The tree was the [[Populus alba|white poplar]] (Greek ''leukē''), the leaves of which are white on one side and dark on the other, representing the duality of upper and underworld.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], note to [[Vergil]]'s ''[[Eclogues|Eclogue]]'' 7.61. Persephone is not mentioned.&lt;/ref&gt; A wreath of white poplar leaves was fashioned by Heracles to mark his [[descent to the underworld|ascent from the underworld]], an ''[[aition]]'' for why it was worn by initiates&lt;ref&gt;Bernabé and Jiménez San Cristóbal, ''Instructions for the Netherworld'', pp. 93 and 124–125, citing [[Harpocration]].&lt;/ref&gt; and by champion athletes participating in [[Funeral games (antiquity)|funeral games]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Calvert, ''P. Vergili Maronis. Aeneidos Liber V'' (Cambridge University Press, 1879), p. 48. This was a particular custom of the [[Rhodians]]; the heroine [[Tlepolemus#Polyxo|Polyxo]] awarded white poplar wreaths to child athletes at the games she presented in honor of her husband; Pierre Grimal, ''The Dictionary of Classical Mythology'' (Blackwell, 1986, 1996), p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other plants associated with Pluto, white poplar was regarded as a contraceptive in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle, ''Contraception and Abortion'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The relation of this tree to the white cypress of the mysteries is debated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Bernard Cook]], ''Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion'' (Cambridge University Press, 1925), pp. 420–422; Bernabé and Jiménez San Cristóbal, ''Instructions for the Netherworld'', pp. 25–26; W.K.C. Guthrie, ''Orpheus and Greek Religion'' (Princeton University Press, 1952, 1993), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The helmet of invisibility ===
The ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus uses the name ''Plouton'' instead of ''Hades'' in relating the tripartite division of sovereignty, the abduction of Persephone, and the visit of Orpheus to the underworld. This version of the theogony for the most part follows Hesiod (see [[#Hesiod's Theogony|above]]), but adds that the three brothers were each given a gift by the [[Cyclopes]] to use in [[Titanomachy|their battle against]] the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]]: Zeus thunder and lightning; Poseidon a [[trident]]; and Pluto a helmet ''(kyneê)''.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 1.1–2, 1911 [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition, translation and notes by [[J.G. Frazer]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The helmet Pluto receives is presumably the magical [[Cap of invisibility|Cap of Invisibility]] ''(aidos kyneê)'', but the ''Bibliotheca'' is the only ancient source that explicitly says it belonged to Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Classical Mythology'', p. 182. Apparent references to the "helmet of Pluto" in other authors, such as [[Irenaeus]] ([https://books.google.com/books?id=fyUMAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=offspring+pluto+OR+pluton+OR+plouton+OR+plutonius&amp;q=%22helmet+of+Pluto%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22helmet%20of%20Pluto%22&amp;f=false ''Against Heresies'']), are misleading; "Pluto" is substituted by the English translator for "Hades."&lt;/ref&gt; The verbal play of ''aidos'', "invisible," and ''Hades'' is thought to account for this attribution of the helmet to the ruler of the underworld, since no ancient narratives record his use or possession of it. Later authors such as [[Rabelais]] (16th century) do attribute the helmet to Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rabelais]], ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' Book 5, Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erasmus]] calls it the "helmet of Orcus"&lt;ref&gt;[[Erasmus]], ''[[Adagia]]'' 2.10.74 ''(Orci galea)''.&lt;/ref&gt; and gives it as a [[figure of speech]] referring to those who conceal their true nature by a cunning device. [[Francis Bacon]] notes the proverbial usage: "the helmet of Pluto, which maketh the politic man go invisible, is secrecy in the counsel, and [[wikt:celerity|celerity]] in the execution."&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon]], ''Essays Civil and Moral'' 21, "Of Delays."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bident ===
[[File:Hendrick Goltzius 003.jpg|thumb|upright|''Pluto'' (1588–89) with bident, [[chiaroscuro]] [[woodcut]] from a series on gods and goddesses by [[Hendrik Goltzius]]]]
No ancient image of the ruler of the underworld can be said with certainty to show him with a [[bident]],&lt;ref&gt;A.L. Millin, "Mythologie," in ''Magasin Encyclopédique'' (Paris, 1808), p. 283; G.T. Villenave, ''Les métamorphoses d'Ovide'' (Paris, 1806), p. 307; [[Arthur Bernard Cook]], ''Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion'' (Oxford University Press, 1924), vol. 2, p. 798 ff.; John G. Fitch, ''Seneca's ''Hercules Furens'': A Critical Text With Introduction and Commentary'' (Cornell University Press, 1987), p.&lt;/ref&gt; though the ornamented tip of his scepter may have been misunderstood at times as a bident.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, ''Zeus'', vol. 2, p. 801.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Roman world, the bident (from ''bi-'', "two" + ''dent-'', "teeth") was an agricultural implement. It may also represent one of the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#manubia|three types of lightning]] wielded by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the Roman counterpart of Zeus, and the Etruscan [[Tinia]]. The later notion that the ruler of the underworld wielded a trident or bident can perhaps be traced to a line in [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s ''[[Hercules (Seneca)|Hercules Furens]]'' ("Hercules Enraged"), in which Father Dis, the Roman counterpart of Pluto, uses a three-pronged spear to drive off [[Hercules in ancient Rome|Hercules]] as he attempts to invade Pylos. Seneca calls Dis the "Infernal Jove"&lt;ref&gt;''Inferni Iovis'' ([[genitive]] case), ''Hercules Furens'' line 47, in the prologue spoken by [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]].&lt;/ref&gt; or the "dire Jove"&lt;ref&gt;''Diro Iovi'', line 608 of ''Hercules Furens''; compare Vergil, ''[[Aeneid]]'' 4.638, ''Iove Stygio'', the "Jove of the [[Styx]]". Fitch, ''Seneca's Hercules Furens'', p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; (the Jove who gives dire or ill omens, ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dirae|dirae]])'', just as in the Greek tradition, ''Plouton'' is sometimes identified as a "chthonic Zeus." That the trident and bident might be somewhat interchangeable is suggested by a Byzantine [[scholiast]], who mentions Poseidon being armed with a bident.&lt;ref&gt;Codex Augustanus, note to [[Euripides]]' ''[[Phoenician Women]]'', line 188, as cited by Cook, ''Zeus'', vol. 2, p. 806, note 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, classical underworld figures began to be depicted with a pitchfork.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, ''Zeus'', vol. 2, p. 803.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Early Christian]] writers had identified the classical underworld with Hell, and its denizens as demons or devils.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Solmsen]], "The Powers of Darkness in Prudentius' ''Contra Symmachum'': A Study of His Poetic Imagination," ''Vigiliae Christianae'' 19.4 (1965), pp. 238, 240–248 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Renaissance, the bident became a conventional attribute of Pluto. In an influential ceiling mural depicting the [[Cupid and Psyche#The Wedding of Cupid and Psyche|wedding of Cupid and Psyche]], painted by [[Raphael]]'s workshop for the [[Villa Farnesina]] in 1517, Pluto is shown holding the bident, with [[Cerberus]] at his side, while Neptune holds the trident.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Stemp, ''The Secret Language of the Renaissance: Decoding the Hidden Symbolism of Italian Art'' (Duncan Baird, 2006), p. 114; Clare Robertson et al., ''Drawings by the Carracci from British Collections'' (Ashmolean Museum, 1996), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps influenced by this work, [[Agostino Carracci]] originally depicted Pluto with a bident in a preparatory drawing for [[#Euhemerism and Latinization|his painting ''Pluto'']] (1592), in which the god ended up holding his characteristic key.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson et al., ''Drawings by the Carracci from British Collections'', pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[#Orphic and philosophical systems|Giove, Nettuno e Plutone]]'' (ca. 1597), a ceiling mural based on [[alchemy|alchemical]] allegory, it is Neptune who holds the bident.&lt;ref name="Gilbert-p124-125"&gt;Creighton Gilbert, ''Caravaggio and His Two Cardinals'' (Penn State University Press, 1995), pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Greek literature and philosophy ==
[[File:Locri Pinax Of Persephone And Hades.jpg|left|thumb|Persephone and Pluto&lt;ref&gt;Identified as Pluto by Bernabé and Jiménez San Cristóbal, ''Instructions for the Netherworld'', p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; or Hades&lt;ref&gt;Identified as Hades by Hansen, ''Classical Mythology'', p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; on a [[pinax]] from [[Locri]]]]
The name ''Plouton'' is first used in [[ancient Greek literature|Greek literature]] by [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Athenian playwrights]].&lt;ref name="Farnell" /&gt; In [[Aristophanes]]' [[Old Comedy|comedy]] ''[[The Frogs]]'' (''Batrachoi'', 405 BC), in which "the Eleusinian colouring is in fact so pervasive,"&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Bowie, ''Aristophanes: Myth, Ritual and Comedy'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993, 1996), p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; the ruler of the underworld is one of the characters, under the name of ''Plouton''. The play depicts a mock [[descent to the underworld]] by the god [[Dionysus]] to bring back one of the dead [[Greek tragedy|tragic playwrights]] in the hope of restoring [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Athenian theater]] to its former glory. Pluto is a silent presence onstage for about 600 lines presiding over a contest among the tragedians, then announces that the winner has the privilege of returning to the [[Upper World (Greek)|upper world]].&lt;ref&gt;As summarized by [[Benjamin Bickley Rogers]], ''The Comedies of Aristophanes'' (London, 1902), pp. xvii and 214 (note to line 1414).&lt;/ref&gt; The play also draws on beliefs and imagery from Orphic and Dionysiac cult, and rituals pertaining to Ploutos (Plutus, "wealth").&lt;ref&gt;Bowie, ''Aristophanes'', pp. 231–233, 269–271.&lt;/ref&gt; In a fragment from another play by Aristophanes, a character "is comically singing of the excellent aspects of being dead", asking in reference to the tripartition of sovereignty over the world:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
And where do you think Pluto gets his name [i.e. "rich"],
if not because he took the best portion?
:::...
How much better are things below than what Zeus possesses!&lt;ref&gt;Bernabé and Jiménez San Cristóbal, ''Instructions for the Netherworld'', pp. 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Plato, the god of the underworld was "an agent in [the] beneficent cycle of death and rebirth" meriting worship under the name of ''Plouton'', a giver of spiritual wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, ''Plato's Cretan City'', pp. 452–453.&lt;/ref&gt; In the dialogue ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', Plato has [[Socrates]] explain the etymology of ''Plouton'', saying that Pluto gives wealth (''ploutos''), and his name means "giver of wealth, which comes out of the earth beneath". Because the name Hades is taken to mean "the invisible", people fear what they cannot see; although they are in error about the nature of this deity's power, Socrates says, "the office and name of the God really correspond":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He is the perfect and accomplished [[Sophist]], and the great benefactor of the inhabitants of the other world; and even to us who are upon earth he sends from below exceeding blessings. For he has much more than he wants down there; wherefore he is called Pluto (or the rich). Note also, that he will have nothing to do with men while they are in the body, but only when the soul is liberated from the desires and evils of the body. Now there is a great deal of philosophy and reflection in that; for in their liberated state he can bind them with the desire of virtue, but while they are flustered and maddened by the body, not even father [[Cronus|Cronos]] himself would suffice to keep them with him in his own far-famed chains.&lt;ref&gt;Translation by Benjamin Jowett, ''The Dialogues of Plato'' (London, 1873), vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Since "the union of body and soul is not better than the loosing,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''Laws'' 828d, translation from Long, ''The Twelve Gods'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; death is not an evil. [[Walter Burkert]] thus sees Pluto as a "god of dissolution."&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Greek Religion'' (Harvard University Press, 1985, originally published 1977 in German), pp. 231, 336. See also ''[[Homo Necans]]'' (University of California Press, 1983, originally published 1972 in German), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the titles of Pluto was ''Isodaitēs'', "divider into equal portions," a title that connects him to the fate goddesses the [[Moirai]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]], entry on Ἰσοδαίτης, 778 in the 1867 edition of Schmidt, as translated and discussed by Richard Seaford, ''Money and the Early Greek Mind: Homer, Philosophy, Tragedy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 51. Hesychius notes that Isodaites may alternatively refer to a son of Pluto as well as Pluto himself.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Isodaitēs'' was also a cult title for Dionysus and [[Helios]].&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Versnel, ''Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion: Transition and Reversal in Myth and Ritual'' (Brill, 1993, 1994), p. 119, especially note 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ordering his ideal city, Plato proposed a calendar in which Pluto was honored as a benefactor in the twelfth month, implicitly ranking him as one of the twelve principal deities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''Laws'' 828 B-D; Morrow, ''Plato's Cretan City'' p. 452; Long, ''The Twelve Gods'', p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Attic calendar]], the twelfth month, more or less equivalent to June, was [[Skirophorion]]; the name may be connected to the rape of Persephone.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, ''Plato's Cretan City'', p. 453; Long, ''The Twelve Gods'', p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theogonies and cosmology ==
=== Euhemerism and Latinization ===
In the theogony of [[Euhemerus]] (4th century BC), the gods were treated as mortal rulers whose deeds were immortalized by tradition. Ennius translated Euhemerus into Latin about a hundred years later, and a passage from his version was in turn preserved by the [[early Christian]] writer [[Lactantius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lactantius]], ''Divine Institutes'' 1.14; Brian P. Copenhaver, ''Polydore Vergil: On Discovery'' (Harvard University Press, 2002), p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt; Here the union of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] (the Roman equivalent of [[Cronus]]) and [[Ops]], an [[ancient peoples of Italy|Italic]] goddess of abundance, produces [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (Greek Zeus), [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] (Hera), Neptune, Pluto, and [[Glauce|Glauca]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then Saturn took Ops to wife. [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]], the elder brother, demanded the kingship for himself. [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] their mother, with their sisters [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] [Demeter] and [[Ops]], persuaded Saturn not to give way to his brother in the matter. Titan was less good-looking than Saturn; for that reason, and also because he could see his mother and sisters working to have it so, he conceded the kingship to Saturn, and came to terms with him: if Saturn had a male child born to him, it would not be reared. This was done to secure reversion of the kingship to Titan's children. They then killed the first son that was born to Saturn. Next came twin children, Jupiter and Juno. Juno was given to Saturn to see while Jupiter was secretly removed and given to Vesta to be brought up without Saturn's knowledge. In the same way without Saturn knowing, Ops bore [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and hid him away. In her third labor Ops bore another set of twins, Pluto and Glauce. (Pluto in Latin is Dis pater;&lt;ref&gt;This parenthetical remark is part of the original text. Several [[manuscript]]s of Lactantius read ''Diespiter'', which is usually a title of Jupiter, but ''Dis pater'' is regarded as the more likely reading. See Katherine Nell MacFarlane, "Isidore of Seville on the Pagan Gods (''Origines'' VIII. 11)," ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' 70 (1980), p. 20, citing [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' vol. VI, col. 190. The relation of the title ''Dis Pater'' to ''Diespiter'' in Latin is debated.&lt;/ref&gt; some call him Orcus.) Saturn was shown his daughter Glauce but his son Pluto was hidden and removed. Glauce then died young. That is the pedigree, as written, of Jupiter and his brothers; that is how it has been passed down to us in holy scripture.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this theogony, which Ennius introduced into Latin literature, Saturn, "Titan,"&lt;ref&gt;"Titan" usually refers to a class or race of deities, but sometimes means [[Helios]] or other divine personifications of the Sun.&lt;/ref&gt; Vesta, Ceres, and Ops are siblings; Glauca is the twin of Pluto and dies mysteriously young. There are several mythological figures named Glauca; the sister of Pluto may be the Glauca who in Cicero's account of the three aspects of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] conceived the third with the equally mysterious Upis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''De natura deorum'' 3.58: "Likewise, there are multiple Dianas. The first is said to have been born as a winged [[Cupid]], with Jove and [[Proserpina]] [as parents]. The second, whom we regard as the daughter of the third Jove and [[Latona]], is better known. A tradition holds that Upis is the father and Glauca the mother of the third [Diana]" ''(Dianae item plures: prima Iovis et Proserpinae, quae pinnatum Cupidinem genuisse dicitur; secunda notior, quam Iove tertio et Latona natam accepimus; tertiae pater Upis traditur, Glauce mater: eam saepe Graeci Upim paterno nomine appellant)''; Copenhaver, ''Polydore Vergil: On Discovery'', p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the genealogy for Pluto that [[Boccaccio]] used in his ''[[Genealogia Deorum Gentilium]]'' and in his lectures explicating the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of [[Dante]].&lt;ref&gt;''Boccaccio's Expositions on Dante's Comedy'', translated by Michael Papio (University of Toronto Press, 2009), pp. 332–333, 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book 3 of the [[Sibylline Oracles]], dating mostly to the 2nd century AD, [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] gives birth to Pluto as she passes by [[Dodona]], "where the watery paths of the River Europus flowed, and the water ran into the sea, merged with the [[Pineios (Peloponnese)|Peneius]]. This is also called the [[Styx|Stygian river]]."&lt;ref&gt;Rieuwerd Buitenwerf, ''Book III of the Sibylline Oracles and Its Social Setting'' (Brill, 2003), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orphic and philosophical systems ===
The Orphic theogonies are notoriously varied,&lt;ref&gt;Gábor Betegh, ''The Derveni Papyrus: Cosmology, Theology and Interpretations'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 151, has noted that "one cannot establish a linear descent between the different versions"; though efforts to do so have been made, "we cannot find a single [[mytheme]] which would occur invariably in all the accounts and could thus create the core of all Orphic theogonies."&lt;/ref&gt; and Orphic cosmology influenced the varying [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] theogonies of [[late antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;J. van Amersfoort, "Traces of an Alexandrian Orphic Theogony in the Pseudo-Clementines," in ''Studies in Gnosticism and Hellenistic Religions, Presented to [[Gilles Quispel]] on the Occasion of His 65th Birthday'' (Brill, 1981), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clementine literature]] (4th century AD) preserves a theogony with explicit Orphic influence that also draws on [[Hesiod]], yielding a distinctive role for Pluto. When the primordial elements came together by orderly cyclonic force, they produced a generative sphere, the "egg" from which the primeval Orphic entity [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]] is born and the world is formed. The release of Phanes and his ascent to the heavenly top of the [[world egg|world-egg]] causes the matter left in the sphere to settle in relation to weight, creating the tripartite world of the traditional theogonies:&lt;ref&gt;Van Amersfoort, "Traces of an Alexandrian Orphic Theogony," pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Its lower part, the heaviest element, sinks downwards, and is called Pluto because of its gravity, weight, and great quantity (''plêthos'') of matter. After the separation of this heavy element in the middle part of the egg the waters flow together, which they call Poseidon. The purest and noblest element, the fire, is called Zeus, because its nature is glowing (ζέουσα, ''zeousa''). It flies right up into the air, and draws up the spirit, now called [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], that was left in the underlying moisture. And when this spirit has reached the summit of the [[Aether (classical element)|ether]], it is devoured by Zeus, who in his turn begets the intelligence (σύνεσις, ''[[Synesis|sunesis]]''), also called [[Athena|Pallas]]. And by this artistic intelligence the etherial artificer creates the whole world. This world is surrounded by the air, which extends from Zeus, the very hot ether, to the earth; this air is called [[Hera]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Amersfoort, "Traces of an Alexandrian Orphic Theogony," pp. 17–18. Betegh, ''The Derveni Papyrus'', p. 151, summarizes this version as follows: "The story starts with Chaos; then comes the egg; the bottom part of the egg submerges and becomes Pluton, and Kronos – not a separate god but identified with [[Chronos]] – swallows this heavy matter. The middle part, covering the first sediment, becomes Poseidon. The upper part of the egg, being purer and lighter, fiery in nature, goes upward and is called Zeus, and so forth."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This cosmogony interprets Hesiod allegorically, and so the heaviest element is identified not as the Earth, but as the netherworld of Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;Van Amersfoort, "Traces of an Alexandrian Orphic Theogony," p. 23; Betegh, ''The Derveni Papyrus'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; (In modern [[geochemistry]], [[Plutonium#Discovery|plutonium]] is the heaviest [[primordial element]].) Supposed etymologies are used to make sense of the relation of physical process to divine name; ''Plouton'' is here connected to ''plêthos'' (abundance).&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Bernard Cook]], ''Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion'' (Cambridge University Press, 1925), p. 746.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Stoicism|Stoic system]], Pluto represented the lower region of the [[Air (classical element)|air]], where according to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (1st century AD) the soul underwent a kind of [[purgatory]] before ascending to the ether.&lt;ref&gt;Cornutus 5; Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 5.66 (on Dis); Seneca, ''Consolatio ad Marciam'' 25; all as cited by Joseph B. Mayor, ''De natura deorum libri tres'' (Cambridge University Press, 1883), vol. 2, p. 175, note to 2.26.66.&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca's contemporary Cornutus made use of the traditional etymology of Pluto's name for Stoic theology. The Stoics believed that the form of a word contained the original truth of its meaning, which over time could become corrupted or obscured.&lt;ref&gt;R.M. van den Berg, ''Proclus' Commentary on the'' Cratylus'' in Context: Ancient Theories of Language and Naming'' (Brill, 2008), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Plouton'' derived from ''ploutein'', "to be wealthy," Cornutus said, because "all things are corruptible and therefore are 'ultimately consigned to him as his property.'"&lt;ref&gt;David Dawson, ''Allegorical Readers and Cultural Revision in Ancient Alexandria'' (University of California Press, 1992), p. 33, citing ''Epidrome'' 5.5.7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] traditions, Pluto was allegorized as the region where souls are purified, located between the moon (as represented by Persephone) and the sun.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''The Face of the Moon'', [[LacusCurtius]] edition of the [[Loeb Classical Library]] translation [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/The_Face_in_the_Moon*/D.html online], as discussed by Leonard L. Thompson, "ISmyrna&lt;!--sic--&gt; 753: Gods and the One God," in ''Reading Religions in the Ancient World: Essays Presented to Robert McQueen Grant on His 90th Birthday'' (Brill, 2007), p. 113, with reference also to [[Iamblichus]]. See also Van den Berg, ''Proclus' Commentary'', p. 49, with reference to Plutarch, ''On the ''E'' at Delphi''.&lt;/ref&gt; Neoplatonists sometimes interpreted the Eleusinian Mysteries as a ''fabula'' of celestial phenomena:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Authors tell the fable that Ceres was Proserpina's mother, and that Proserpina while playing one day was kidnapped by Pluto. Her mother searched for her with lighted torches; and it was decreed by Jupiter that the mother should have her daughter for fifteen days in the month, but Pluto for the rest, the other fifteen. This is nothing but that the name Ceres is used to mean the earth, called Ceres on analogy with ''crees'' ('you may create'), for all things are created from her. By Proserpina is meant the moon, and her name is on analogy with ''prope serpens'' ('creeping near'), for she is moved nearer to the earth than the other planets. She is called earth's daughter, because [[Earth (classical element)|her substance has more of earth]] in it than of the other [[classical elements|elements]]. By Pluto is meant the shadow that sometimes obstructs the moon.&lt;ref&gt;This interpretation is attributed to the Greek Neoplatonist [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]] (2nd century AD), by the French [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[William of Conches]], as cited and translated by [[Peter Dronke]], ''Fabula: Explorations into the Uses of Myth in Medieval Platonism'' (Brill, 1985), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Plouton Helios ====
[[File:Caravaggio Jupiter Neptune Pluto vertical.jpg|thumb|left|''Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto'', ceiling mural (''ca.'' 1597) by [[Caravaggio]] (see description under [[#Fine art|Fine art below)]]]]
A dedicatory inscription from [[Smyrna]] describes a 1st–2nd century sanctuary to "God Himself" as the most exalted of a group of six deities, including clothed statues of ''Plouton Helios'' and ''Koure Selene'', "Pluto the Sun" and "Kore the Moon."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, "ISmyrna 753," p. 101ff. The other deities are ''Helios Apollon'', who is paired with [[Artemis]] (p. 106); Zeus, who is subordinated to "God Himself"; and [[Men (god)|Mēn]], an Anatolian moon deity sometimes identified with [[Attis]], who had a table before him for ceremonial dining (pp. 106, 109).&lt;/ref&gt; The status of Pluto and Kore as a divine couple is marked by what the text describes as a "linen embroidered bridal curtain."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, "ISmyrna 753," pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt; The two are placed as bride and groom within an enclosed temple, separately from the other deities cultivated at the sanctuary.

''Plouton Helios'' is mentioned in other literary sources in connection with ''Koure Selene'' and ''Helios Apollon''; the sun on its nighttime course was sometimes envisioned as traveling through the underworld on its return to the east. [[Apuleius]] describes a rite in which the sun appears at midnight to the initiate at the gates of Proserpina; it has been suggested that this midnight sun could be ''Plouton Helios''.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, "ISmyrna 753," p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smyrna inscription also records the presence of ''Helios Apollon'' at the sanctuary. As two forms of Helios, Apollo and Pluto pose a dichotomy:
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto;"
! Helios Apollon !! Plouton Helios
|-
| One || Many
|-
| clarity || invisibility
|-
| bright || dark
|-
| memory || oblivion&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, "ISmyrna 753," pp. 110–111, 114, with reference to the teachings of [[Ammonius of Athens|Ammonius]] as recorded by [[Plutarch]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/misctracts/plutarchE.html ''The E at Delphi''.] The relevant passage (21) is: "This appears from the names, in themselves opposite and contradictory. He is called Apollo, another is called Pluto; he is Delius (apparent), the other Aidoneus (invisible); he is Phoebus (bright), the other Skotios (full of darkness); by his side are the [[Muses]], and [[Mnemosyne|Memory]], with the other are Oblivion and Silence; he is Theorius and Phanæus, the other is 'King of dim Night and ineffectual Sleep'." See also Frederick E. Brenk, "Plutarch's Middle Platonic God," ''Gott und die Götter bei Plutarch'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2005), pp. 37–43, on Plutarch's etymological plays that produce these antitheses.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
It has been argued that the sanctuary was in the keeping of a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sodalitas|sodality or "brotherhood"]]. The relation of Orphic beliefs to the mystic strand of Pythagoreanism, or of these to [[Platonism]] and [[Neoplatonism]], is complex and much debated.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, "ISmyrna 753," ''passim'', conclusion presented on p. 119. Thompson bases his argument on the particular collocation of deities at the sanctuary, and explicating theological details in the inscription through comparative material. See also [[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Plutonius ====
[[File:Serapis.JPG|thumb|left|Serapis with moon and sun on oil lamp]]
In the [[Hellenistic era]], the title or epithet ''Plutonius'' is sometimes affixed to the names of other deities. In the [[Hermetica|Hermetic Corpus]],&lt;ref&gt;In the Latin dialogue ''Asclepius'' sometimes attributed to [[Apuleius]]; see B.L. Hijmans, "Apuleius, Philosophus Platonicus," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.36.1 (1987), p. 441, ''et passim'' on the question of authorship.&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter Plutonius "rules over earth and sea, and it is he who nourishes mortal things that have soul and bear fruit."&lt;ref&gt;[[File:Bardo Baal Thinissut.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Baal-Hammon]] ]]''Terrae vero et mari dominatur Iupiter Plutonius, et hic nutritor est animantium mortalium et fructiferarum'' (''Asclepius'' 27), noted by G.F. Hildebrand, ''L. Apuleii Opera Omnia'' (Leipzig, 1842), p. 314, as equivalent to the Pluto described by [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], ''Argonautica'' 1.780, where, however, the god is called Dis and not Pluto. Translation from Brian P. Copenhaver, ''Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius'' (Cambridge University Press, 1992, 2002), p. 83; see also note to the passage p. 245. Influence from [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]], particularly the figure of [[Baal-Hammon]], may explain this particular syncretism; [[Jean-Pierre Mahé]], ''Le fragment du "Discours parfait" dans la Bibliothèque de Nag Hammadi'', ''Colloque International sur les textes de Nag hammadi (Québec, 22–25 août 1978)'' (Éditions Peeters, 1981), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[History of Alexandria#Ptolemaic era|Ptolemaic Alexandria]], at the site of a dream oracle, [[Serapis]] was identified with Aion Plutonius.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander romance|Pseudo-Callisthenes]], I.30–33, as cited by Jarl Fossum, "The Myth of the Eternal Rebirth: Critical Notes on G.W. Bowersock, ''Hellenism in Late Antiquity''," ''Vigiliae Christianae'' 53.3 (1999), p. 309, note 15. On the oracle and for the passage in which Aion Plutonius is named, see Irad Malkin, ''Religion and Colonization in Ancient Greece'' (Brill, 1987), p. 107, especially note 87.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gilles Quispel]] conjectured that this figure results from the integration of the Orphic Phanes into [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithraic religion]] at Alexandria, and that he "assures the eternity of the city," where the birth of [[Aion (deity)|Aion]] was celebrated at the sanctuary of Kore on 6 January.&lt;ref&gt;"On this day and at this hour the Virgin gave birth to Aion": [[Gilles Quispel]], "Hermann Hesse and Gnosis," in ''Gnostica, Judaica, Catholica: Collected Essays'' (Brill, 2008), p. 258, noting that this date coincided with [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] and was a new year's celebration.&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin, ''Plutonius'' can be an [[adjective]] that simply means "of or pertaining to Pluto."&lt;ref&gt;As at [[Horace]], ''Carmen'' 1.4.17, where the ''domus ... Plutonia'' renders in Latin the Greek phrase "house of Hades."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neoplatonic demiurge ====
The Neoplatonist [[Proclus]] (5th century AD) considered Pluto the third [[demiurge]], a [[Sublunary sphere|sublunar]] demiurge who was also identified variously with Poseidon or [[Hephaestus]]. This idea is present in [[Renaissance Neoplatonism]], as for instance in the cosmology of [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–99),&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Demiurge," ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; who translated Orphic texts into Latin for his own use.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Orpheus," ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 665. It was even said that the soul of Orpheus had been reborn into Ficino.&lt;/ref&gt; Ficino saw the sublunar demiurge as "a [[daimon|daemonic]] 'many-headed' [[sophist]], a [[magus]], an enchanter, a fashioner of images and reflections, a [[Shapeshifting|shape-changer]] of himself and of others, a poet in a way [[being|of being and of not-being]], a royal Pluto." This demiurgic figure identified with Pluto is also "'a purifier of souls' who presides over the magic of love and generation and who uses a fantastic counter-art to mock, but also ... to supplement, the divine [[Jacopo Mazzoni#Theory|icastic or truly imitative art]] of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] translunar Demiurge."&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Demiurge," in ''The Classical Tradition'' p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianization ===
[[Christian literature|Christian writers]] of [[late antiquity]] sought to discredit the competing gods of Roman and Hellenistic religions, often adopting the euhemerizing approach in regarding them not as divinities, but as people glorified through stories and cultic practices and thus not true deities worthy of worship. The infernal gods, however, retained their potency, becoming identified with the [[Devil]] and treated as [[demon]]ic forces by [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologists]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Solmsen]], "The Powers of Darkness in [[Prudentius]]' ''Contra [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachum]]'': A Study of His Poetic Imagination," ''Vigiliae Christianae'' 19 (1965) 237–257; Margaret English Frazer, "Hades Stabbed by the Cross of Christ," ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'' 9 (1974) 153–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

One source of Christian revulsion toward the chthonic gods was the arena. Attendants in divine costume, among them a "Pluto" who escorted corpses out, were part of the ceremonies of the [[gladiator]]ial games.&lt;ref&gt;K.M. Coleman, "Fatal Charades: Roman Executions Staged as Mythological Enactments," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 80 (1990), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]] calls the mallet-wielding figure usually identified as the [[Etruscan religion|Etruscan]] [[Charun]] the "brother of Jove,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Ad nationes'' 1.10. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] regularly calls the Roman ruler of the underworld ''Pluto'' in ''[[City of God (book)|De civitate Dei]]''; see 2.15, where Pluto and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] are described as the brothers of Jove; 4.10, in noting their three-way division of sovereignty over the earth and with Proserpina as Pluto's spouse ''(coniunx)''; 4.11, in deriding the allegorizing of divinity in physical cosmogony; and 6.7, in denouncing the mysteries ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacra|sacra]])'' as obscene.&lt;/ref&gt; that is, Hades/Pluto/Dis, an indication that the distinctions among these denizens of the underworld were becoming blurred in a Christian context.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Harmon, "The Religious Significance of Games in the Roman Age," in ''The Archaeology of the Olympics: The Olympics and Other Festivals in Antiquity'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 1988), p. 242; Paul-Marie Duval, "Sucellus, the God with a Hammer," in ''American, African, and Old European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1993), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prudentius]], in his poetic polemic against the religious traditionalist [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]], describes the arena as a place where savage vows were fulfilled on an altar to Pluto ''(solvit ad [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ara|aram]] / Plutonis fera [[votum|vota]])'', where fallen gladiators were [[human sacrifice]]s to Dis and [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] received their souls as [[Charon's obol|his payment]], to the delight of the underworld Jove ''(Iovis infernalis)''.&lt;ref&gt;Prudentius, ''Contra Symmachum'' 1.379–398; Donald G. Kyle, ''Spectacles of Death in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 1998, 2001), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval mythography ===
Medieval mythographies, written in Latin, continue the conflation of Greek and Roman deities begun by the ancient Romans themselves. Perhaps because the name Pluto was used in both traditions, it appears widely in these Latin sources for the classical ruler of the underworld, who is also seen as the double, ally, or adjunct to the figure in [[Christian mythology]] known variously as the [[Christian teaching about the Devil|Devil]], [[Satan]], or [[Lucifer]]. The classical underworld deities became casually interchangeable with Satan as an embodiment of [[Hell]].&lt;ref&gt;Solmsen, "The Powers of Darkness," pp. 237–257; Frazer, "Hades Stabbed by the Cross of Christ", pp. 153–161.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the 9th century, [[Abbo Cernuus]], the only witness whose account of the [[Siege of Paris (885–886)|Siege of Paris]] survives, called the invading [[Vikings]] the "spawn of Pluto."&lt;ref&gt;''Dic igitur, praepulchra polis, quod Danea munus / Libavit tibimet soboles Plutonis amica'', ''Bella Parisiacae urbis'' 1.21, as noted by Nirmal Dass, "Temporary Otherness and Homiletic History in the Late Carolingian Age: A Reading of the ''Bella Parisiacae urbis'' of Abbo of Stain-Germain-des-Prés," in ''Difference and Identity in Francia and Medieval France'' (Ashgate Publishing, 2010), p. 106. In his earlier edition, translation, and commentary of the work, Dass gives "Speak, most wondrous of cities, of the gift the Danes brought for you, / Those friends of Pluto", in ''Viking Attacks on Paris: The 'Bella Parisiacae Urbis' of Abbo of Saint-Germain-des-Prés'' (Peeters, 2007), pp. 28–29, but ''{{lang|la|soboles}}'' (classical Latin ''{{lang|la|suboles}}'') means "progeny, offspring," modified by ''{{lang|la|amica}}'', "dear, beloved."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Little Book on Images of the Gods'', Pluto is described as
&lt;blockquote&gt;
an intimidating personage sitting on a throne of sulphur, holding the scepter of his realm in his right hand, and with his left strangling a soul. Under his feet three-headed Cerberus held a position, and beside him he had three [[Harpies]]. From his golden throne of sulphur flowed four rivers, which were called, as is known, [[Lethe]], [[Cocytus]], [[Phlegethon]] and [[Acheron]], tributaries of the [[Styx|Stygian swamp]].&lt;ref&gt;''De deorum imaginibus libellus'', chapter 6, "De Plutone": ''homo terribilis in solio sulphureo sedens, sceptrum regni in manu tenens dextra: sinistra, animam constringes, cui tricipitem Cerberum sub pedibus collocabant, &amp; iuxta se tres Harpyias habebat. De throno aurê eius sulphureo quatuor flumina manabunt, quae scilicet Lethum, Cocytû, Phlegethontem, &amp; Acherontem appellabant, &amp; Stygem paludem iuxta flumina assignabant''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This work derives from that of the [[Vatican Mythographer|Third Vatican Mythographer]], possibly one Albricus or Alberic, who presents often extensive allegories and devotes his longest chapter, including an [[excursus]] on the nature of the soul, to Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;The questions of authorship involving the ''De deorum imaginibus libellus''  and the ''Liber Ymaginum deorum'' ("Book of Images of the Gods") are vexed; Ronald E. Pepin, ''The Vatican Mythographers'' (Fordham University Press, 2008), pp. 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval and Renaissance literature ===

In [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (written 1308–1321), Pluto presides over the [[Inferno (Dante)#Fourth Circle (Greed)|fourth circle of Hell]], to which the greedy are condemned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dante]], ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', Canto VII.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian form of the name is ''Pluto'', taken by some [[commentary (philology)|commentators]]&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Peter Bondanella]] in his note to the translation of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], ''The Inferno: Dante Alighieri'' (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics, 2003), pp. 202–203. Dante may simply be preserving the longstanding conflation of Greek ''Plouton'' and ''Ploutos''; see [[Allen Mandelbaum]], note to his translation of ''The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri: Inferno'' (Bantam Dell, 2004, originally published 1980), p. 357. In modern Italian, the name of the classical ruler of the underworld is ''Plutone''.&lt;/ref&gt; to refer specifically to Plutus as the god of wealth who would preside over the torment of those who hoarded or squandered it in life.&lt;ref&gt;The tormented souls wail ''"Perché tieni? e "Perché burli?"'' ("'Why do you hoard?' 'Why do you squander?'"): ''Inferno'', Canto VII, line 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Dante's Pluto is greeted as "the great enemy"&lt;ref&gt;''Il gran nemico'', ''Inferno'', Canto VI, line 115.&lt;/ref&gt; and utters the famously impenetrable line ''[[Papé Satàn, papé Satàn aleppe]]''. Much of this Canto is devoted to the power of [[Fortuna]] to give and take away. Entrance into the fourth circle has marked a downward turn in the poet's journey, and the next landmark after he and his guide cross from the circle is the [[Styx|Stygian]] swamp, through which they pass on their way to the [[Dis (Divine Comedy)|city of Dis]] (Italian ''Dite''). Dante's clear distinction between Pluto and Dis suggests that he had Plutus in mind in naming the former. The city of Dis is the "citadel of Lower Hell" where the walls are garrisoned by [[fallen angel]]s and [[Furies]].&lt;ref&gt;Bondanella, ''The Inferno'' p. 206; Mandelbaum, ''Inferno'' p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Pluto is treated likewise as a purely Satanic figure by the 16th-century Italian poet [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]] throughout his epic ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Nash, ''Jerusalem Delivered: An English Prose Version'' (Wayne State University Press, 1987), pp. xi and 475.&lt;/ref&gt; in which "great Dis, great Pluto" is invoked in the company of "all ye devils that lie in deepest hell."&lt;ref&gt;Tasso, ''Jerusalem Delivered'', Canto 13.7, translated by Edward Fairfax (1907).&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by Ovid and Claudian, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (1343–1400)&lt;ref&gt;In ''The House of Fame'' (lines 1510–1511), Chaucer explicitly acknowledges his debt to Claudian "That bar up al the fame of helle, / Of Pluto, and of Proserpyne," as noted by Radford, ''The Lost Girls'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; developed the myth of Pluto and [[Proserpina]] (the Latin name of Persephone) in [[English literature]]. Like earlier medieval writers, Chaucer identifies Pluto's realm with [[Hell]] as a place of condemnation and torment,&lt;ref&gt;In ''Troilus and Criseyde'' (lines 590–503), as noted by Rosalyn Rossignol, ''Critical Companion to Chaucer: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work'' (Facts on File, 2006), p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt; and describes it as "derk and lowe" ("dark and low").&lt;ref&gt;Chaucer, "The Knight's Tale" 2082 and 2299.&lt;/ref&gt; But Pluto's major appearance in the works of Chaucer comes as a character in "[[The Merchant's Tale]]," where Pluto is identified as the "Kyng of Fayerye" ([[Fairy]] King).&lt;ref&gt;Rossignol, ''Critical Companion'' pp. 432, 540.&lt;/ref&gt; As in the anonymous [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] ''[[Sir Orfeo]]'' (''ca.'' 1300), Pluto and Proserpina rule over a fantastical world that melds classical myth and [[Álfheimr|fairyland]].&lt;ref&gt;John M. Fyler, "Pagan Survivals," in ''A Companion to Chaucer'' (Blackwell, 2000, 2002), p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaucer has the couple engage in a comic [[wikt:battle of the sexes|battle of the sexes]] that undermines the [[Christian symbolism|Christian imagery]] in the tale, which is Chaucer's most sexually explicit.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Lerer, "The Canterbury Tales," in ''The Yale Companion to Chaucer'' (Yale University Press, 2006), p. 270. Pluto and Proserpina in ''The Merchant's Tale'' have been seen as Shakespeare's model for [[Titania (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Titania]] and [[Oberon]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', a view at least as old as Chaucer's editor [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] (see [https://books.google.com/books?id=vM0_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA97 1798 edition]) and reiterated by [[Walter William Skeat]] in his edition of ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' ([https://archive.org/details/completeworksge08chaugoog &lt;!-- quote=pluto oberon. --&gt; 1894 edition]).&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish poet [[William Dunbar]] ''ca.'' 1503 also described Pluto as a folkloric supernatural being, "the elrich [[incubus]] / in cloke of grene" ("the [[wikt:eldritch|eldritch]] incubus in cloak of green"), who appears among the [[courtier]]s of [[Cupid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Dunbar]], ''The Goldyn Targe'' (1503), lines 126–7, as cited by Ian Simpson Ross, ''William Dunbar'' (Brill, 1981), p. 252. Compare also [[Arthur Golding]]'s "elves of hell" to translate Ovid's ''Avernales ... nymphas'', "[[nymph]]s of [[Avernus]]" (''Metamorphoses'' 5.670, in his account of the abduction).&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Pluto'' for the classical ruler of the underworld was further established in English literature by [[Arthur Golding]], whose translation of Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' (1565) was of great influence on [[William Shakespeare]],&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's references to Pluto are conventional. Pluto is associated with Hell in the "Roman" plays ''[[Coriolanus]]'' (I.iv, "Pluto and Hell!" as an exclamation) and ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' (IV.iii, "Pluto's region," and "Pluto sends you word, / If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall"), as also in ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'' (II.iv): "I'll see her damn'd first; – to Pluto's damned lake, by this hand, to th' infernal deep, with [[Erebus]] and tortures vile also." Pluto's gates are a [[metaphor]] for strength in ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' (V.ii), where Pluto is also sworn by (III.iv and V.ii). The performance of Orpheus is referenced in ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'' (line 553): "And moody Pluto winks while Orpheus plays." Shakespeare also uses the name of Roman Dis, as in Perdita's catalogue of flowers in ''[[A Winter's Tale]]'' (IV.iii): "O Proserpina, / For the flowers now, that, frighted, thou lett'st fall / From Dis's waggon!"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Marlowe]],&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' (III.ii, 1616 [[quarto]]), [[Mephistopheles]] invokes "Pluto's blue fire" in casting a spell of invisibility on the protagonist. In his translation of [[Lucan]]'s epic, Marlowe uses ''Pluto'' for ''Dis'' (''First Book of Lucan'', lines 449, where "Pluto" refers to the [[druid]]ic god [[Julius Caesar]] [[interpretatio romana|identified with]] Dis, and 576), but uses both names in the mythological narrative ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edmund Spenser]].&lt;ref&gt;Spenser plays on the conflation of Pluto and Plutus: "but a little stride ... did the house of Richesse from hell-mouth divide" and "Here Sleep, there Richesse, and Hel-gate them both betwext" (24.5), as noted by Thomas E. Maresca, entry on "Hell", ''The Spencer Encyclopedia'', p. 352. See [[#Offspring|Offspring of Pluto (above)]] on the daughter Spenser invents for Pluto. His favored epithet for Pluto is ''griesly'', an [[archaism]] for "[[wikt:grisly|grisly]]" (''FG'' I.iv.11.1, II.vii.24.1, IV.iii.13.2, VI.xii.35.6, applied to Proserpina at I.i.37.4; Pluto named also at ''FG'' I.v.14.8, II.viii.24.1, VI.xii.35.6, VII.vii.5.9, and ''[[The Shepheardes Calender]]'' "October" 29).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert DeMaria Jr. and Robert D. Brown, ''Classical Literature and Its Reception: An Anthology'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 453. Both ''Dis'' and ''Pluto'' appear in the works of Shakespeare and Marlowe, but ''Pluto'' with greater frequency; Spenser prefers the name Pluto.&lt;/ref&gt; Golding translates Ovid's ''Dis'' as Pluto,&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Golding]], ''Ovid's Metamorphoses'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tdWe6KGKVOEC&amp;dq=pluto+intitle%3Ametamorphoses+inauthor%3Agolding&amp;q=pluto#v=snippet&amp;q=pluto&amp;f=false passim]'', with a few instances of [https://books.google.com/books?id=tdWe6KGKVOEC&amp;dq=golding+metamorphoses+marlowe+influence+OR+influenced&amp;q=Dis#v=snippet&amp;q=Dis&amp;f=false Dis]; Radford, ''The Lost Girls'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; a practice that prevails among English translators, despite [[John Milton]]'s use of the Latin ''Dis'' in ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, at ''Paradise Lost'' 4.270, as cited by Radford, ''The Lost Girls'', p. 25, where Proserpine is described as a flower fairer than those she was gathering and "by gloomy Dis / was gathered."&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian perception of the classical underworld as Hell influenced Golding's translation practices; for instance, Ovid's ''tenebrosa sede tyrannus / exierat'' ("the [[tyrant]] ''[Dis]'' had gone out of his shadowy realm") becomes "the prince of fiends forsook his darksome hole".&lt;ref&gt;''Ovid's Metamorphosis Translated by Arthur Golding'', edited by Madeleine Forey, (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), p. 164. Pluto rules over Hell throughout Spenser's ''Faerie Queene,'' as noted by Maresca, ''The Spenser Encyclopedia'', p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pluto's court as a literary setting could bring together a motley assortment of characters. In [[Huon de Méry]]'s 13th-century poem "The Tournament of the [[Antichrist]]", Pluto rules over a congregation of "classical gods and demigods, biblical devils, and evil Christians."&lt;ref&gt;John Block Friedman, ''Orpheus in the Middle Ages'' (Syracuse University Press, 2000), p. 238; ''Li Tournoiemenz Anticrit'' ''(Le tornoiement de l'Antéchrist)'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=o8QZAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Huon+de+Mery%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jchiTb77IpTBtgfhs5TYCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=pluton%20OR%20pluto&amp;f=false text.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th-century [[dream allegory]] ''[[The Assembly of Gods]]'', the deities and personifications are "apparelled as medieval nobility"&lt;ref&gt;Theresa Lynn Tinkle, ''Medieval Venuses and Cupids: Sexuality, Hermeneutics, and English Poetry'' (Stanford University Press, 1996), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; basking in the "magnyfycence" of their "lord Pluto," who is clad in a "smoky net" and reeking of sulphur.&lt;ref&gt;''The Assembly of Gods'', lines 82, 51, 311, 314, in the edition of Oscar Lovell Triggs (London, 1896).&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the [[Renaissance]], images and ideas from [[classical antiquity]] entered [[popular culture]] through the [[Renaissance technology#Printing press|new medium of print]] and through [[masque|pageants]] and other public performances at festivals. The [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Fête-Dieu]] at [[Aix-en-Provence]] in 1462 featured characters costumed as a number of classical deities, including Pluto,&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Popular Culture," ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 766.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pluto was the subject of one of seven pageants presented as part of the 1521 [[Midsummer Eve]] festival in [[Tudor London|London]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Lindenbaum, "Ceremony and Oligarchy: The London Midsummer Watch," in ''City and Spectacle in Medieval Europe'', (University of Minnesota Press, 1994), p. 171; Maria Hayward, ''Rich Apparel: Clothing and the Law in Henry VIII's England'' (Ashgate, 2009), p. 290. The court of Pluto continued to inspire public pageantry into the late 19th century, when floats such as the "blazing 'Palace of Pluto'" were part of the [[New Orleans Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras parades in New Orleans]]; Henri Schindler, ''Mardi Gras Treasures: Costume Designs of the Golden Age'' (Pelican, 2002), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 15th century, no mythological theme was brought to the stage more often than Orpheus's descent, with the court of Pluto inspiring fantastical [[stagecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;Nino Pirrotta, ''Music and Theatre from [[Poliziano]] to Monteverdi'' (Cambridge University Press, 1992, originally published in Italian 1969), ''passim'', especially p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonardo da Vinci]] designed a set with a rotating mountain that opened up to reveal Pluto emerging from the underworld; the drawing survives and was the basis for a modern recreation.&lt;ref&gt;Pirrotta, ''Music and Theatre from [[Poliziano]] to Monteverdi'', with [https://books.google.com/books?id=rDTeG7IG8jIC&amp;pg=PA274-IA6&amp;dq=Pluto+%22rotating+stage+and+the+interior+of+Hades%22+-fabula&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QlVxTYy9NJLegQeLpMg7&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pluto%20%22rotating%20stage%20and%20the%20interior%20of%20Hades%22%20-fabula&amp;f=false Leonardo's drawing] (n.p.); Carlo Pedretti, ''Leonardo: The Machines'' (Giunti, 1999), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opera and ballet ===
The tragic descent of the hero-musician Orpheus to the underworld to retrieve his bride, and his performance at the court of Pluto and Proserpina, offered compelling material for [[libretto|librettists]] and composers of opera (see [[List of Orphean operas]]) and [[History of ballet|ballet]]. Pluto also appears in works based on other classical myths of the underworld. As a singing role, Pluto is almost always written for a [[bass (voice type)|bass voice]], with the low [[vocal range]] representing the depths and weight of the underworld, as in [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]] and [[Ottavio Rinuccini|Rinuccini]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607) and ''[[Il ballo delle ingrate]]'' (1608). In their ''[[ballo]]'', a form of ballet with vocal numbers, Cupid invokes Pluto from the underworld to lay claim to "ungrateful" women who were immune to love. Pluto's part is considered particularly virtuosic,&lt;ref&gt;Mark Ringer, ''Opera's First Master: The Musical Dramas of Claudio Monteverdi'' (Amadeus Press, 2006), pp. 34, 75, 103–104; Tim Carter, ''Monteverdi's Musical Theatre'' (Yale University Press, 2002), p. 95; [[Enid Welsford]], ''The Court Masque'' (Cambridge University Press, 1927), pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; and a reviewer at the première described the character, who appeared as if from a blazing Inferno, as "formidable and awesome in sight, with garments as given him by poets, but burdened with gold and jewels."&lt;ref&gt;Tim Carter, ''Monteverdi's Musical Theatre'' p. 81, quoting Follino, ''Compendio delle sontuose feste'' (1608), and p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean Raoux – Orpheus and Eurydice.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean Raoux]]'s ''Orpheus and Eurydice'' (1718–20), with Pluto and Proserpina releasing the couple]]
The role of Pluto is written for a bass in [[Jacopo Peri|Peri]]'s ''[[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]]'' (1600);&lt;ref&gt;George J. Buelow, ''A History of Baroque Music'' (Indiana University Press, 2004), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giulio Caccini|Caccini]]'s ''[[Euridice (Caccini)|Euridice]]'' (1602); [[Luigi Rossi|Rossi]]'s ''[[Orfeo (Rossi)|Orfeo]]'' (1647); [[Antonio Cesti|Cesti]]'s ''[[Il pomo d'oro]]'' (1668);&lt;ref&gt;Kristiaan Aercke, ''Gods of Play: Baroque Festive Performances as Rhetorical Discourse'' (SUNY Press, 1994), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonio Sartorio|Sartoris]]'s ''[[Orfeo (Sartorio)|Orfeo]]'' (1672); [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]'s ''[[Alceste (Lully)|Alceste]]'', a ''[[tragédie en musique]]'' (1674);&lt;ref&gt;Piero Gelli and Filippo Poletti, ''Dizionario dell'opera 2008'' (Baldini Castoldi Dalai, 2005, 2007), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier|Charpentier]]'s [[chamber opera]] ''[[La descente d'Orphée aux enfers]]'' (1686);&lt;ref&gt;Charpentier's Pluto is a [[bass-baritone]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]]'s ''[[Orpheus (Telemann)|Orpheus]]'' (1726); and [[Jean-Philippe Rameau|Rameau]]'s ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]]'' (1733).&lt;ref&gt;Gelli and Poletti, ''Dizionario dell'opera 2008'', p. 625.&lt;/ref&gt; Pluto was a [[baritone]] in [[Proserpine (Lully)|Lully's ''Proserpine'']] (1680), which includes a duo dramatizing the conflict between the royal underworld couple that is notable for its early use of musical characterization.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Anthony, ''French Baroque Music from Beaujoyeulx to Rameau'' (Amadeus Press, 1997), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous of the Orpheus operas is [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s satiric ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]'' (1858),&lt;ref&gt;Pluto does not have a singing role in [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'s ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' (1762).&lt;/ref&gt; in which a [[tenor]] sings the role of ''Pluton'', disguised in the giddily convoluted plotting as Aristée ([[Aristaeus]]), a farmer.

Scenes set in Pluto's realm were [[orchestration|orchestrated]] with [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] that became conventionally "hellish", established in Monteverdi's ''L'Orfeo'' as two [[cornet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, a [[bassoon]], and a [[Regal (musical instrument)|régale]].&lt;ref&gt;Aercke, ''Gods of Play'', p. 250; Ringer, ''Opera's First Master'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pluto has also been featured as a role in ballet. In Lully's "Ballet of Seven Planets'" interlude from [[Francesco Cavalli|Cavalli]]'s opera ''[[Ercole amante]]'' ("[[Hercules]] in Love"), [[Louis XIV]] himself danced as Pluto and other characters; it was a spectacular flop.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Trout, ''City on the Seine: Paris in the Time of Richelieu and Louis XIV'' (St. Martin's Press, 1996), pp. 189–190; Buelow, ''A History of Baroque Music'', p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Pluto appeared in [[Jean-Georges Noverre|Noverre]]'s lost ''La descente d'Orphée aux Enfers'' (1760s). [[Gaétan Vestris]] danced the role of the god in [[Florian Johann Deller|Florian Deller]]'s ''Orefeo ed Euridice'' (1763).&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Heartz, ''Music in European Capitals: The Galant Style, 1720–1780'' (W.W. Norton, 2003), pp. 488–492.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Persephone'' choreographed by [[Robert Joffrey]] (1952) was based on [[André Gide]]'s line "king of winters, the infernal Pluto."&lt;ref&gt;Sasha Anawalt, ''The Joffrey Ballet: Robert Joffrey and the Making of an American Dance Company'' (University of Chicago Press, 1996), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fine art ===
[[File:Dürer - Die Entführung auf dem Einhorn - Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum.png|thumb|[[Albrecht Dürer]], ''Abduction of Proserpine on a Unicorn'' (1516)]]
[[File:Rembrandt - The Rape of Proserpine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Rembrandt's ''Abduction of Proserpina'' (''ca.'' 1631)]]
The abduction of Proserpina by Pluto was the scene from the myth most often depicted by [[fine art|artists]], who usually follow Ovid's version. The influential emblem book ''[[Iconologia]]'' of Cesare Ripa (1593, second edition 1603) presents the allegorical figure of Rape with a shield on which the abduction is painted.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Kiefer, ''Shakespeare's Visual Theatre: Staging the Personified Characters'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Isaacsz. van Swanenburg]], the first teacher of [[Rembrandt]], echoed Ovid in showing Pluto as the target of [[Cupid]]'s arrow while [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] watches her plan carried out (location of painting unknown). The [[:File:Ovid Met 5 395ff – Rubens – Pluto taking Proserpina.jpg|treatment of the scene]] by [[Rubens]] is similar. Rembrandt incorporates Claudian's more passionate [[characterization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Golahney, "Rembrandt's Abduction of Proserpina," in ''The Age of Rembrandt: Studies in Seventeenth-Century Dutch Painting'' (Penn State University Press, 1988), p. 30; Eric Jan Sluijter, ''Rembrandt and the Female Nude'' (Amsterdam University Press, 2006), pp. 109–111.&lt;/ref&gt; The performance of Orpheus in the court of Pluto and Proserpina was also a popular subject.

Major artists who produced works depicting Pluto include:
* [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]], ''Abduction of Proserpine on a Unicorn'' (1516), [[etching]]. Dürer's first English biographer called this work "a wild, weird conception" that "produces a most uncomfortable, shuddering impression on the beholder."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Margaret Heaton]], ''The History of the Life of Albrecht Dürer of Nürnberg'' (London, 1870), p. 187; Walter L. Strauss, ''The Complete Engravings, Etchings, and Drypoints of Albrecht Dürer'' (Dover, 1973), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The source or significance of the [[unicorn]] as the form of transport is unclear; Dürer's preparatory drawing showed a conventional horse. Pluto seems to be presented in a manner that recalls the [[Wild Hunt#Leader of the Wild Hunt|leader of the Wild Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, ''The Complete Engravings'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Caravaggio]], ''Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto'' (Italian ''Giove, Nettuno e Plutone'', ''ca.'' 1597), a [[mural|ceiling mural]] (pictured under [[#Orphic and philosophical systems|Theogonies and cosmology above]]) intended for viewing from below, hence the unusual perspective. Caravaggio created the work for a room adjacent to the [[alchemy|alchemical]] [[Distillation#History|distillery]] of [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Francesco Maria Del Monte]], his most important [[patronage|patron]]. The three gods hover around a translucent globe that represents the world: Jupiter with his eagle, Neptune holding a bident, and Pluto accompanied by a bluish-gray horse and a [[Cerberus]] who resembles a three-headed [[Border Collie|border collie]] more than a [[hellhound]]. In addition to personifying the [[classical elements]] [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], and [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], the three figures represent "an allegory of the [[applied science]] of alchemy".&lt;ref name="Gilbert-p124-125" /&gt;
* [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], [[:File:Jan Brueghel (I) - Orpheus in the Underworld - WGA03564.jpg|''Orpheus before Pluto and Proserpina'']] (1604), painting.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Orpheus," ''The Classical Tradition'' p. 665.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], ''Pluto and Proserpina'' (1621–22), also known as ''[[The Rape of Proserpina]]'', sculpture with a Cerberus looking in three different directions.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Sculpture," ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 870.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rembrandt]], ''Abduction of Proserpina'' (''ca.'' 1631), painting influenced by Rubens (via the [[engraving]] of his student [[Pieter Soutman]]).&lt;ref&gt;Golahny, "Rembrandt's Abduction of Proserpina," p. 30ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Rembrandt's leonine Pluto draws on Claudian's description of the god as like a ravening lion.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Golahny, ''Rembrandt's Reading: The Artist's Bookshelf of Ancient Poetry and History'' (Amsterdam University Press, 2003), pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern literature ===
After the Renaissance, literary interest in the abduction myth waned until the revival of classical myth among the [[Romanticism|Romantics]]. The work of mythographers such as [[J.G. Frazer]] and [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] helped inspire the recasting of myths in modern terms by [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] writers. In ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' (1891), [[Thomas Hardy]] portrays Alec d'Urberville as "a grotesque parody of Pluto/Dis" exemplifying the late-[[Victorian morality|Victorian culture]] of [[patriarchy|male domination]], in which women were consigned to "an endless breaking ... on the wheel of biological reproduction."&lt;ref&gt;Radford, ''The Lost Girls'', pp. 85, 98, 114, citing Chelser, ''Women and Madness'', pp. 240, 266.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar figure is found in ''[[The Lost Girl]]'' (1920) by [[D.H. Lawrence]], where the character Ciccio&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps a play on the Italian verb ''chioccia'' used by Dante to describe Pluto's manner of speaking in ''Inferno'', Canto VII, line 2.&lt;/ref&gt; acts as Pluto to Alvina's Persephone, "the deathly-lost bride ... paradoxically obliterated and vitalised at the same time by contact with Pluto/Dis" in "a prelude to the grand design of rebirth." The darkness of Pluto is both a source of regeneration, and of "merciless annihilation."&lt;ref&gt;Radford, ''The Lost Girls'', pp. 247, 252, 254, ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence takes up the theme elsewhere in his work; in ''The First Lady Chatterley'' (1926, an early version of ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]''), Connie Chatterley sees herself as a Persephone and declares "she'd rather be married to Pluto than Plato," casting her earthy gamekeeper lover as the former and her philosophy-spouting husband as the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, ''The Lost Girls'', p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rick Riordan]]'s [[young adult literature|young adult]] fantasy series ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'', the character [[Hazel Levesque]] is the daughter of Pluto, god of riches. She is one of seven characters with a parent from classical mythology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rick Riordan]], ''The Son of Neptune'' (Disney-Hyperion Books, 2011), p. 111 (vol. 2 of ''The Heroes of Olympus'' series).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific terms ==
Scientific terms derived from the name of Pluto include:

* [[Pluto]], the planetoid, with related terms [[plutoid]] and [[plutino]];
* [[plutonium]], the heaviest [[Primordial element#Naturally occurring nuclides that are not primordial|naturally occurring element]], named after the planetoid;
* [[pluton]], a geologic term of
* [[plutonism]], a geologic theory.

[[File:(Roman) Temple of Antenociticus (3) - geograph.org.uk - 837888.jpg|thumb|right|Temple of Antenociticus]]
In [[Romano-British]] worship, the local god '''Antenociticus''', also recorded as "Anociticus" at the same temple site in Benwell, was possibly worshipped as source of inspiration and intercession in military affairs.

==Centres of worship==
===Condercum===
Antenociticus appears at only one site in [[Great Britain|Britain]], the fort of [[Condercum]], on [[Hadrian's Wall]], where three altars to the god were found within the ruins of a small temple. This god is not mentioned on any known Roman altar stones from the continent, and is therefore thought to be a native British deity. The fact that the god is revered at [[Benwell]] (1327 [et Num Aug], 1328, 1329 [c.AD175-7]) by a legionary [[Legatus|legate]], the [[Military tribune|tribune]] of an auxiliary infantry cohort and the [[Prefect#Military prefects|prefect]] of an auxiliary cavalry ala, lends credence to this assumption, and perhaps proves that the god was not transferred here as the [[patron deity]] of an [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/benwell-roman-temple-hadrians-wall/history/ |title=HISTORY OF BENWELL ROMAN TEMPLE: THE TEMPLE AND ITS DEDICATIONS |author1=[[Paul Bidwell]] |accessdate=10 November 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sandstone head of the statue of Antenociticus was discovered in 1862 at the temple in Benwell. A [[torc]] can be seen around the neck, and the hair on the head curls forward so as to resemble two horns. Parts of the lower leg and forearm of the statue were also found, indicating that a life-sized statue of the god once stood in the temple.

The small temple of Antenociticus stands in the [[vicus]] (civilian settlement) outside Benwell (Condercum) Fort, one of 13 permanent forts added to the line of Hadrian's Wall during its construction. The temple was built in about AD 178-80, probably to mark the promotion of the Roman cavalry prefect who dedicated one of three altars in the temple to Antenociticus. It is thought Antenociticus was possibly worshipped as a source of inspiration and intercession in military matters. Antenociticus is not mentioned at any other Romano-British site or on any inscriptions from the Continent, hence his identification as a local deity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=18241 ''Archaeologists unearth carved head of Roman god in ancient rubbish dump''], Durham University Press Release.&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of Antenociticus and the temple altars, formerly displayed at the [[Museum of Antiquities]] at [[Newcastle University]], can now be seen at the [[Great North Museum]] in the same city of Newcastle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/latest/watch-listen/west-end-stories-west-end-stories-the-roman-god-of-benwell-antenociticus.html West End Stories: West End Stories: The Roman God of Benwell - Antenociticus]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Andrew Parkin from the Great North Museum talks about the Roman God of Benwell, Antenociticus.

Archaeologists have speculated that a similar sandstone head, unearthed at [[Binchester Roman Fort]] near [[Bishop Auckland]] in 2013, may also be of Antenociticus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130704095057.htm ''Archaeologists Unearth Carved Head of Roman God in Ancient Rubbish Dump''], Science Daily, July 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/04/stone-head-roman-geordie-god Archaeologists find ancient stone head which could be Roman Geordie god: Discovery at Roman fort near Bishop Auckland, County Durham, thought to be a local war god from 1,800 years ago] Published online Wednesday 3 July 2013 19.01 EDT by Guardian News and Media Limited.

      <text bytes="11556" xml:space="preserve">'''Crepitus''' is an alleged [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god of [[flatulence]].  It is unlikely that Crepitus was ever actually worshipped. The only ancient source for the claim that such a god was ever worshipped comes from [[Christianity|Christian]] [[satire]]. The name ''Crepitus'' standing alone would be an inadequate and unlikely name for such a god in [[Latin]].{{further explanation needed|date=April 2014}} The god appears, however, in a number of important works of [[French literature]].

[[File:Ostia-Toilets.JPG|thumb|Roman public [[toilet]]s from [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]]]]

==Sources of the legend==
The origin of the myth is somewhat obscure, as it is possible that the existence of this god is an invention by a satirist. No ancient polytheistic source appears for this deity.

The earliest mention of a god of flatulence is as an [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]], not a [[Roman mythology|Roman]] deity.  This comes from the hostile pen of the author of the ''[[Clementine literature|Recognitions]]'' dubiously attributed to [[Pope Clement I]], in which it is reported that:

:''alii ... crepitus ventris pro numinibus habendos esse docuerunt.''
::"others (among the Egyptians) teach that intestinal noise (Latin: ''crepitus ventris'') ought to be regarded as a god."&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Clement, ''[http://www.compassionatespirit.com/Recognitions/Introductory-Notice.htm Recognitiones] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040821005145/http://www.compassionatespirit.com/Recognitions/Introductory-Notice.htm |date=August 21, 2004 }}'' 5.20.  English version available in ''The Ante-Nicene Fathers'', Rev. Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, editors, Vol. VIII.  (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Wm. B Eerdmans Publishing Company) [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf08.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unlikely that Clement I was the author of the extant ''Recognitiones''; these are extant chiefly in a Latin translation, presumably out of the original Greek, made by [[Tyrannius Rufinus]] in the late fourth or early fifth century.  The passage of Pseudo-Clement stands within a Western Christian tradition of satire against the variety of minor deities worshipped by classical pagans; similar passages exist in ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' by Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]], and [[Tertullian]]'s ''Ad Nationes''.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.viii.ii.xi.html Ad Nationes]'' 2.11; Augustine, ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.IV.34.html?highlight=rumina#highlight The City of God]'' 4.34&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]], in ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'', mentions a god ''Crepitus Ventris'' among a variety of other deities allegedly worshipped in [[classical antiquity]]:

:[[Lilius Giraldus]] repeats many of her ceremonies: all affections of the mind were heretofore accounted gods, love, and sorrow, virtue, honour, liberty, contumely, impudency, had their temples, tempests, seasons, ''Crepitus Ventris, dea Vacuna, dea Cloacina'', there was a goddess of idleness, a goddess of the draught, or jakes, Prema, Premunda, Priapus, bawdy gods, and gods for all offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.psyplexus.com/burton/21.htm |title=Robert Burton, ''The Anatomy of Melancholy'', sect. 2, book 1, memb. 3 |access-date=2007-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113135146/http://www.psyplexus.com/burton/21.htm |archive-date=2006-11-13 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton cites a work called ''Syntagma de Diis'' ("A Compendium of the Gods") by [[Giglio Gregorio Giraldi|Lilius Giraldus]] as his source for the existence of such a god; by this reference, Burton probably meant Giraldus' ''Historia de diis gentium'' ("History of the Pagan Gods"); but because Burton wrote in what he called an "extemporean" style, ''quicquid in buccam venit'' ("whatever came into his head"),&lt;ref&gt;Robert Burton, ''The Anatomy of Melancholy'', Preface, "Democritus Junior to the Reader"&lt;/ref&gt; Burton's quotations and references are not always reliable.&lt;ref&gt;"A Note on the Text" by William H. Gass to ''The Anatomy of Melancholy (New York Review Books Classics)'' (New York Review of Books, 1991), {{ISBN|0-940322-66-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of Burton's mixed [[Latin]] and English style, this passage may not say that there was a god ''named'' "Crepitus Ventris", (Latin for "intestinal noise"), but only that there was a god of intestinal noise.  The Latin word ''crepitus'', moreover, did not exclusively mean the sound generated by intestinal gas; it referred to squeaks, groans, knocks, and any nondescript noise in general.  In ''The City of God'', Augustine elsewhere refers to ''crepitus cymbalorum'', the clang of [[cymbal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''The City of God'' 7.24, referring to the use of cymbals in the cult of [[Cybele]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Medical jargon gives the name ''[[crepitus]]'' to the creaking or popping noises made by the joints.  The [[Latin profanity#Pēdere: fart|Latin word for "to fart"]] is ''pēdere''.&lt;ref&gt;The Latin noun ''crepitus'' is in the fourth [[Latin declension]], and its [[genitive case]] would also be ''crepitūs''.  See generally ''The Classic Latin Dictionary'' (Follett, Chicago, 1961) sub. tit. ''crepitus''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voltaire]], in a passage of his ''[[Philosophical Dictionary]]'' devoted to changing conceptions of [[deity]], alludes to a number of real or alleged Roman deities of a less exalted status:

:''La déesse des tétons, dea Rumilia; la déesse de l’action du mariage, dea Pertunda; le dieu de la chaise percée, deus Stercutius; le dieu Pet, deus Crepitus, ne sont pas assurément bien vénérables. . .  Il est sûr que deus Crepitus, le dieu Pet, ne donnait pas la même idée que'' deus divum et hominum sator, ''la source des dieux et des hommes.''
::"The goddess of breasts, ''dea Rumilia''; the goddess of the marital act, ''dea Pertunda''; the god of the toilet, ''deus Stercutius''; the god Fart, ''deus Crepitus'', were surely not quite objects of reverence. . . It is certain that ''deus Crepitus'', the god Fart, did not give the same sort of idea as ''deus divum et hominum sator'', the creator of gods and men."
:: &amp;mdash; "Polytheism", entry in the ''Philosophical Dictionary'' of Voltaire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voltaire-integral.com/Html/20/polytheisme.htm "Polytheism", entry in the ''Philosophical Dictionary'' of Voltaire.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through these passages, the noun ''Crepitus'' moves from a [[common noun]] to a [[proper noun]].  Previous authorities had only claimed that the ancient polytheists, whether Egyptian or Roman, worshipped a god of intestinal noises.  Perhaps in Burton's mention, and certainly in Voltaire, ''Crepitus'' is the name of a god of flatulence.

==In Baudelaire==
Baudelaire criticised both the need of religion and the mediocrity of [[Modern paganism|neopagan]] artists in the essay "[[The Pagan School]]" ("L'École païenne"):
:''Pastiche ! pastiche ! Vous avez sans doute perdu votre âme quelque part, dans quelque mauvais endroit, pour que vous couriez ainsi à travers le passé comme des corps vides pour en ramasser une de rencontre dans les détritus anciens ? Qu'attendez-vous du ciel ou de la sottise du public ? Une fortune suffisante pour élever dans vos mansardes des autels à Priape et à Bacchus ? Les plus logiques d'entre vous seront les plus cyniques. Ils en élèveront au dieu Crepitus.''
::"Pastiche! pastiche! You must have all surely lost your soul somewhere, in some bad place, to be thus running now through the past as emptied carcasses, trying to pick one up from the ancient detritus on stumbling on it by haphazard. Have you not? What are you expecting of the heavens or the folly of the public? Could it be a fortune swollen enough to raise altars to Priapus and Bacchus upon your mansard roofs? The most sane amongst you shall be those most cynical: they shall raise it in honour of the god Crepitus."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/bib_lisieux/ecolpaie.htm Full text (French Original)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216171358/http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/bib_lisieux/ecolpaie.htm |date=2006-12-16 }} Translation for Wikipedia by Roberto Salazar.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Flaubert==
Relying on Voltaire's account, [[Gustave Flaubert]] put a memorable speech into the mouth of the alleged deity Crepitus in ''[[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (Flaubert)|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]]'':
:'''CREPITUS:''' ''Moi aussi l'on m'honora jadis. On me faisait des libations. Je fus un Dieu!''
:''L'Athénien me saluait comme un présage de fortune, tandis que le Romain dévot me maudissait les poings levés et que le pontife d'Égypte, s'abstenant de fèves, tremblait à ma voix et pâlissait à mon odeur.''
:''Quand le vinaigre militaire coulait sur les barbes non rasées, qu'on se régalait de glands, de pois et d'oignons crus et que le bouc en morceaux cuisait dans le beurre rance des pasteurs, sans souci du voisin, personne alors ne se gênait. Les nourritures solides faisaient les digestions retentissantes. Au soleil de la campagne, les hommes se soulageaient avec lenteur.''
:''J'ai eu mes jours d'orgueil. Le bon Aristophane me promena sur la scène, et l'empereur Claudius Drusus me fit asseoir à sa table. Dans les laticlaves des patriciens j'ai circulé majestueusement! Les vases d'or, comme des tympanons, résonnaient sous moi;--et quand plein de murènes, de truffes et de pâtés, l'intestin du maître se dégageait avec fracas, l'univers attentif apprenait que César avait dîné!''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10982/10982-8.txt ''La Tentation de St. Antoine''], Project Gutenberg etext (French).&lt;/ref&gt;

::"I once was honoured.  Libations were made to me.  I was a God!
::"The Athenian once hailed me as a favourable omen, while the pious Roman cursed me with raised fists, and the pontiff of Egypt, abstinent from beans, trembled at my voice and paled at my odour. . .
::"When the army vinegar ran down unshaven beards, when men helped themselves to acorns, peas, and raw onions, and cooked chopped up goat meat in shepherds' rank butter &amp;mdash; never mind your neighbour &amp;mdash; no one was embarrassed by me.  Solid foods made for sound digestions.  In the sun of the countryside, men took their ease at their leisure. . .
::"I had my glory days.  Jolly Aristophanes placed me on the stage, and the emperor Claudius Drusus had me sitting at his table.  I made the rounds majestically in the ''[[laticlave]]s'' of patricians!  The golden vessels resounded under me like kettledrums &amp;mdash; and when stuffed with lamprey, truffles, and pâtés, the intestine of the Master noisily emptied itself, an attentive universe learned that Caesar had dined!"&lt;ref&gt;Translation for Wikipedia by Steve Gustafson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A modern invention==
While Flaubert learned from his friend [[Fréderic Baudry]], who in turn had consulted [[Alfred Maury]], that "poor little Deus Crepitus does not exist; it's a modern invention," he liked his text so much that he left him in.&lt;ref&gt;''The Temptation of St. Anthony'', translated and with introduction and notes by Kitty Mrosovsky (Penguin Classics, 1980) {{ISBN|0-14-044410-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is unlikely that the god Crepitus ever existed, the scene from [[Aristophanes]] is genuine; in ''[[The Clouds]]'' Athenians compare [[thunder]] to the sound of celestial flatulence.

'''Turmasgade''' is a little known god, known from about 10 inscriptions from the [[Roman Empire]]. The name 'Turmasgade' is [[Aramaic]] and means "mountain of worship" or "mountain of sanctuary". ''Tur'' means "mountain"; ''msgd'' - "worship" or "sanctuary". This may indicate that Turmasgade was a holy mountain, but also a deity. In some inscriptions he is identified with [[Zeus]], but in other there is no evidence of such identification. It has been suggested that the god from the originates from the [[Kingdom of Commagene]].&lt;ref name=Yale&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=A. H. M. |title=M. I. Rostovtzeff, A. R.

{{Special characters}}

In [[ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology|myth]], the '''Anemoi''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἄνεμοι}}, "Winds") were wind gods who were each ascribed a [[cardinal direction]] from which their respective winds came (see [[Classical compass winds]]), and were each associated with various [[season]]s and [[weather]] conditions. They were the progeny of the [[Dawn deities|goddess of the dawn]] [[Eos]] and her husband [[Astraeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Roman, L., &amp; Roman, M. (2010). {{Google books|tOgWfjNIxoMC|Encyclopedia of Greek and Roman mythology.|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The earliest attestation of the word in Greek and of the worship of the winds by the Greeks, are perhaps the [[Mycenaean Greek]] word-forms {{lang|gmy|{{script|Linb|𐀀𐀚𐀗𐀂𐀋𐀩𐀊}}}}, {{Lang|gmy-latn|a-ne-mo-i-je-re-ja}}, {{lang|gmy|{{script|Linb|𐀀𐀚𐀗𐄀𐀂𐀋𐀩𐀊}}}}, {{Lang|gmy-latn|a-ne-mo,i-je-re-ja}}, i.e. "priestess of the winds".   These words, written in [[Linear B]], are found on the [[Knossos|KN]] Fp 1 and KN Fp 13 tablets.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minoan.deaditerranean.com/resources/linear-b-sign-groups/a/a-ne-mo/|title=a-ne-mo|last=Raymoure|first=K.A.|work=Linear B Transliterations|publisher=Deaditerranean.

==Mythology==
[[Image:Tower of the Winds frieze detail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tower of the Winds]] in ancient [[Athens]], part of the frieze depicting the Greek wind gods Boreas (north wind, on the left) and Skiron (northwesterly wind, on the right)]]

The Anemoi are minor gods and are subject to the god [[Aeolus (Odyssey)|Aeolus]]. They were sometimes represented as [[wind|gusts of wind]], and at other times were personified as [[wing]]ed men. They were also sometimes depicted as [[horse]]s kept in the stables of the storm god [[Aeolus (Odyssey)|Aeolus]], who provided [[Odysseus]] with the Anemoi in the ''[[Odyssey]]''. The [[Laconia|Spartans]] were reported to sacrifice a horse to the winds on [[Taygetus|Mount Taygetus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 2.34.2 compared by [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] to the Roman sacrifice of the [[October Horse]], 190 in the edition of Lindsay.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Astraeus]], the astrological deity (sometimes associated with [[Aeolus (Odyssey)|Aeolus]]), and [[Eos]]/[[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]], the goddess of the [[dawn]], were the parents of the Anemoi, according to the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]].

Of the four chief Anemoi, [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] (Aquilo in [[Roman mythology]]) is the north wind and bringer of cold winter air, [[Zephyrus]] (Favonius in [[Latin]])&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Aulus Gellius 2.22.12.&lt;/ref&gt; is the west wind and bringer of light spring and early-summer breezes, and [[Notus]] (Auster in [[Latin]]) is the south wind and bringer of the storms of late summer and autumn; [[Eurus]], the southeast&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Scott, &amp; Jones Greek Lexicon.&lt;/ref&gt; (or according to some,&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Lewis and Short, Latin Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; the east) wind, was not associated with any of the three [[Attic calendar|Greek seasons]], and is the only one of these four Anemoi not mentioned in Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]]'' or in the  [[Orpheus#Orphic poems and rites|Orphic hymns]].

The deities equivalent to the Anemoi in [[Roman mythology]] were the '''Venti''' ([[Latin]], "winds"). These gods had different names, but were otherwise very similar to their Greek counterparts, borrowing their attributes and being frequently conflated with them. Ptolemy's world map listed 12 winds: Septentrio (N), Aquilo (NNE), Vulturnus (NE), Subsolanus (E), Eurus (SE), Euroauster (SSE), Austeronotus (S), Euronotus (SSW), Africus (SW), Zephirus (W), Eurus (NW), Circius (NNW).

===Boreas===&lt;!--linked from 'North'--&gt;
[[Image:WindGod2.JPG|thumb|[[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist]] fragment of the god Boreas with billowing cloak (''[[velificatio]]'') overhead. [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], [[Afghanistan]]]]
''Boreas'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|ɔː|r|i|.|ə|s|}}, {{IPAc-en|uk|ˌ|b|ɒ|r|i|.|ə|s}}, {{IPAc-en|uk|ˌ|b|ɒ|r|i|.|æ|s}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Longman pronunciation dictionary |first=John C. |last= Wells |publisher=Longman |location=Harlow, England |year=1990 |isbn=0582053838 |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|grc|Βορέας}}, {{Lang|grc-latn|Boréas}}; also {{lang|grc|Βορρᾶς}}, {{grc-transl|Βορρᾶς}})&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|*bore/as1|Βορέας}}, {{LSJ|*borra{{=}}s|Βορρᾶς|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the Greek god of the cold [[north wind]], storms and winter. Although he was normally taken as the north wind, the Roman writers [[Aulus Gellius]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] both took Boreas as a northeast wind, equivalent to the Roman Aquilo,&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=LatinAugust2012&amp;query=Gell.%202.22.11&amp;getid=1][[Aulus Gellius]]&lt;span&gt;, 2.22.9&lt;/span&gt;; [http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=LatinAugust2012&amp;query=Plin.%20Nat.%202.46&amp;getid=1][[Pliny the Elder]]&lt;span&gt; N.H. 2.46&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to [[Nor'easter]] [[winter storms]]. Boreas is depicted as being very strong, with a violent temper to match. He was frequently shown as a winged old man or sometimes as a young man with shaggy hair and beard, holding a [[conch]] shell and wearing a billowing cloak.{{ref|boreas}} [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] wrote that Boreas had [[snake]]s instead of feet, though in art he was usually depicted with winged human feet.

Boreas was closely associated with horses, storms and winter. He was said to have fathered twelve colts after taking the form of a stallion, to the mares of [[Erichthonius of Dardania|Erichthonius]], king of [[Dardanus (city)|Dardania]]. These were said to be able to run across a field of grain without trampling the plants. [[Pliny the Elder]] (''Natural History'' iv.35 and viii.67) thought that mares might stand with their hindquarters to the North Wind and bear foals without a stallion. The Greeks believed that his home was in Thrace, and [[Herodotus]] and Pliny both describe a northern land known as [[Hyperborea]] "Beyond the North Wind" where people lived in complete happiness and had extraordinarily long lifespans. He is said to have fathered three giant Hyperborean priests of [[Apollo]] by [[Chione (daughter of Arcturus)|Chione]].

When the goddess [[Leto]], pregnant with [[Artemis]] and Apollo, was due, Boreas was ordered by Zeus to bring her to [[Poseidon]], who in turn led her to the island of [[Ogygia]] where she could give birth to the twins, as Zeus' wife [[Hera]] had ordered all places and land to shun Leto.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' [https://topostext.org/work/206#140 140]; March s.v. [https://archive.org/details/casselldictionar00jenn/page/233/mode/2up?view=theater Leto]&lt;/ref&gt;

Boreas was also said to have kidnapped [[Orithyia of Athens|Orithyia]], an [[Athens|Athenian]] princess, from the [[Ilisos]]. Boreas had taken a fancy to Orithyia and had initially pleaded for her favours, hoping to persuade her. When this failed, he reverted to his usual temper and abducted her as she danced on the banks of the Ilisos. Boreas wrapped Orithyia up in a cloud, raped her, and with her, Boreas fathered two sons—the [[Boreads]], Zethes and Calais, who were part of the crew of the ''[[Argo]]'' as [[Argonauts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library'', 4.44.2; [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' [https://archive.org/details/argonautica00apoluoft/page/16/mode/2up?view=theater 1.211–223], [https://archive.org/details/argonautica00apoluoft/page/116/mode/2up?view=theater 2.231–239]; Grimal, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|*borea/dhs|Βορεάδης|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—and two daughters—[[Chione (daughter of Boreas)|Chione]], goddess of snow, and [[Cleopatra (Greek myth)|Cleopatra]].

From then on, the Athenians saw Boreas as a relative by marriage. When Athens was threatened by [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]], the people prayed to Boreas, who was said to have then caused winds to sink 400 Persian ships. A cult was established in Athens in 480 B. C. E. in gratitude to the Boreas for destroying the approaching Persian fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Roman|first=Luke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOgWfjNIxoMC|title=Encyclopedia of Greek and Roman Mythology|last2=Roman|first2=Monica|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2639-5|pages=105|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar event had occurred twelve years earlier, and Herodotus writes:&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Hdt. 7.189.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

: Now I cannot say if this was really why the Persians were caught at anchor by the stormwind, but the Athenians are quite positive that, just as Boreas helped them before, so Boreas was responsible for what happened on this occasion also. And when they went home they built the god a shrine by the River Ilissus.

Two other cases of Boreas being honored by Greek states for similar assistance have been described, in [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] (against [[Laconia]]) and in [[Thurii]] (against [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]). The latter case had Boreas being granted citizenship and a land plot.&lt;ref&gt;the Boreas [https://www.theoi.com/Titan/AnemosBoreas.html entry] at theoi.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The abduction of Orithyia was popular in Athens before and after the Persian War, and was frequently depicted on vase paintings. In these paintings, Boreas was portrayed as a bearded man in a tunic, with shaggy hair that is sometimes frosted and spiked. The abduction was also dramatized in [[Aeschylus]]'s lost play ''Oreithyia''.

In other accounts, Boreas was the father of [[Butes]] (by another woman) and the lover of the nymph [[Pitys (mythology)|Pitys]]. In one story, both Pan and Boreas vied for Pitys's affections, and tried to make her choose between them. To impress her, Boreas uprooted all the trees with his might. But Pan only laughed, and Pitys choose him instead of Boreas. Angry, Boreas chased Pitys down and threw her off a cliff, killing her. Gaia, pitying the girl, changed her dead body into a pine tree.&lt;ref&gt;[[Libanius]], ''[[Progymnasmata]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=kRi-If9IAOYC&amp;pg=PA27 1.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[Aesop]] [[Aesop's Fables|fable]], Boreas and his uncle [[Helios]] the sun god [[The North Wind and the Sun|argued]] about which one between them was the strongest god. They agreed that whoever was able to make a passing traveller remove his cloak would be declared the winner. Boreas was the one to try his luck first; but no matter how hard he blew, he could not remove the man's cloak, instead making him wrap his cloak around him even tighter. Helios shone bright then, and the traveller, overcome with the heat, removed his cloak, giving him the victory; the moral is that persuasion is better than force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aesop]], ''[[Aesop's Fables|Fables]]'' [http://www.mythfolklore.net/aesopica/oxford/183.htm 183]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], Boreas blessed [[Musaeus]] with the gift of flight.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.22.7&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160 1.22.7]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aquilo (Septentrio)====
The [[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent of Boreas was '''Aquilo'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]], 2.22.9; [[Pliny the Elder]] N.H. 2.46.&lt;/ref&gt; This north (and slightly east) wind&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Short, [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Daquilo s.v. aquilo].&lt;/ref&gt; was associated with winter. The poet [[Virgil]] writes:&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeneid]] 3, lines [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0690.phi003.perseus-lat1:3.278-3.293 284–285].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Verse translation|Interea magnum sol circumvolvitur annum,
et glacialis hiemps aquilonibus asperat undas.|Now had the sun rolled through the year's full circle,
and the waves were rough with icy winter's northern gales&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0690.phi003.perseus-eng2:3.278-3.293|title=P. Vergilius Maro, Aeneid, Book 3, line 278|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;|lang=la}}

For the wind which came directly from the north the Romans sometimes used the name '''Septentrio''', which refers to the seven ({{Lang|la|septem}}) stars of the [[Big Dipper|Plow or Big Dipper]] constellation. The name "Septentrio" gave rise to the pre-modern compass point ''[[Septentrional]]is''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=LatinAugust2012&amp;query=Vitr.%201.6.10&amp;getid=1 Vitruvius 1.6.13]; [http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=LatinAugust2012&amp;query=Plin.%20Nat.%202.46&amp;getid=1 Pliny the Elder 2.51].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zephyrus (Favonius)===
[[File:Affreschi romani - pompei - nozze zefiro e clori particolare.JPG|thumb|Zephyrus on an antique fresco in [[Pompeii]]]]
[[Image:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Flora And Zephyr (1875) transparency.png|thumb|left|Zephyrus, the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[God (male deity)|god]] of the [[west wind]] and the [[goddess]] [[Chloris (nymph)|Chloris]], from an 1875 [[Flora and Zephyr (Bouguereau)|oil painting by William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]]]

[[File:Zephyr and Flora, c.1720, by Antonio Corradini, V&amp;A.JPG|thumb|upright|''Zephyr and Flora'', c. 1720, by Antonio Corradini, [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]]]

''Zephyrus'' (Gk. {{lang|grc|Ζέφυρος}} [{{lang|grc-Latn|Zéphyros}}]),&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; sometimes shortened in English to ''Zephyr'', is the Greek god of the [[west wind]] or [[Köppen climate classification|continental]] [[Tropics|tropical]] [[air mass]] (cT). The gentlest of the winds, Zephyrus is known as the fructifying wind, the messenger of spring. It was thought that Zephyrus lived in a cave in [[Thrace]].

Zephyrus was reported as having several wives in different stories. He was said to be the husband of [[Iris (deity)|Iris]], goddess of the rainbow. He abducted the goddess [[Chloris (nymph)|Chloris]], and gave her the domain of flowers. With Chloris, he fathered [[Karpos]] ('fruit'). He is said to have vied for [[Chloris (nymph)|Chloris's]] love with his brother Boreas, eventually winning her devotion. Additionally, with yet another sister and lover, the [[harpy]] [[Podarge]] (also known as [[Celaeno]]), Zephyrus was said to be the father of [[Balius and Xanthus]], [[Achilles]]' horses.

In the story of [[Cupid and Psyche|Eros and Psyche]], Zephyrus served [[Eros]] (or Cupid) by transporting Psyche to his abode.

Zephyrus was also claimed to have killed one of Apollo's many male lovers [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]] out of jealousy. Hyacinth was killed by a discus thrown by Apollo. Though according to some sources, his death was said to be an accident, others said that Zephyrus was the true culprit, having blown the discus off course.

Zephyrus' Roman equivalent was '''Favonius''' (the "favouring") who held dominion over plants and flowers. The Roman poet [[Horace]] writes:&lt;ref&gt;Horace, Odes 3.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Verse translation|quid fles, Asterie, quem tibi candidi
primo restituent vere Favonii?|Why do you weep, Asterie, for the man whom the bright west winds
will restore to you at the beginning of spring?|lang=la}}

===Notus (Auster)===
''Notus'' ({{lang|grc|Νότος}}, {{Lang|grc-latn|Nótos}}) was the Greek god of the [[south wind]] or [[Air mass|marine]] [[Tropics|tropical]] [[air mass]] (mT). He was associated with the desiccating hot wind of the rise of [[Sirius]] after [[midsummer]], was thought to bring the storms of late summer and early autumn, and was feared as a destroyer of crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.ca/imgres?q=pig&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1067&amp;bih=529&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=uT5h-lzuZ4rioM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.ilex-press.com/2012/04/did-you-come-here-looking-for-a-pig/&amp;docid=J1SMqkF-E-j4aM&amp;imgurl=http://www.ilex-press.com/wp-content/uploads/pig-thumb1.jpg&amp;w=400&amp;h=298&amp;ei=60qJUe6_OrGayQGc4YDABw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=145&amp;tbnw=194&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=12&amp;ved=1t:429,r:2,s:0,i:167&amp;tx=121&amp;ty=119 |title=Google Image Result for |publisher=Google.ca |access-date=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:VarsaviaPalazzo4VentiVento1 (cropped and mirrored).jpg|thumb|right|A statue of Notus.]]
Notus' equivalent in Roman mythology was '''Auster''', the embodiment of the [[sirocco]] wind, a southerly wind which brings cloudy weather, powerful winds and rain to southern Europe. (''Auster'' named the [[compass]] point ''[[South|Australis]]'' and the country's name ''[[Australia]]''.) The Auster winds are mentioned in [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]] Book II, lines 304–307:

{{Verse translation|in segetem veluti cum flamma furentibus Austris incidit,
aut rapidus montano flumine torrens
sternit agros, sternit sata laeta boumque labores,
praecipitesque trahit silvas|Just as when a flame falls on the standing grain while the South Winds rage,
or a rushing mountain stream lays low the fields,
lays low the glad crops and labors of oxen,
and drags down forests headlong.|lang=la}}

Another Roman poet, [[Tibullus]] 1.1, lines 47–48, speaks of the pleasure of lying in bed on rainy winter days:

{{Verse translation|aut, gelidas hibernus aquas cum fuderit Auster,
securum somnos igne iuvante sequi|or when the winter South Wind has poured out his cold waters,
to fall asleep carefree with the help of a fire.|lang=la}}

The name ''Australia'' (the "southern land") is derived from ''Auster''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=australia Online etymological dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eurus (Vulturnus)===
{{Redirect|Eurus|the fictional character|List of Sherlock characters#Eurus Holmes}}
''Eurus'' ({{lang|grc|Εὖρος}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|Euros}}) according to some was the southeast wind, but according to others the east wind.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; On the [[Tower of the Winds]] in Athens, Eurus occupies the southeast side, while Apeliotes is in the east. However, it is widely accepted{{By whom|date=August 2022}} that Eurus is the east wind, while Apeliotes is the southeast wind.

Eurus' Roman counterpart is '''Vulturnus''', according to [[Pliny the Elder]];&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder 2.46; cf. Columella 15&lt;/ref&gt; but for [[Aulus Gellius]] Volturnus was the equivalent of the southeast wind Euronotus.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, 2.22.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally in the Latin poets the name '''Eurus''' is used for the east or southeast wind, as in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Virgil, Aen. 12.730, Horace, Odes 2.16, Ovid, Met. 15.552.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurus is a wind of storm, described as a turbulent wind during storms and tossing ships on the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Titan/AnemosEuros.html|title=EURUS (Euros) - Greek God of the East Wind|website=www.theoi.com|access-date=2020-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Flaccus.

A. Loeb Classical Library Vol 144. Frag. 858 (from Strasbourg papyrus)''.'' Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Eurus is also called the "hot wind" by Nonnus in [[Dionysiaca]]. Eurus is closely related to Helios in passages of the Dionysiaca, being called from his place near [[Helios]]' palace, Phaethon, where the sun rose in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, Dionysiaca.

== Lesser winds ==
Four lesser wind deities appear in a few ancient sources, such as at the [[Tower of the Winds]] in Athens:

'''Kaikias''' (or Caecius) is the Greek deity of the northeast wind.  He is shown on the monument as a bearded man with a shield full of hailstones.

'''Apeliotes''' (or Apheliotes; the name means 'from the (rising) sun') is the Greek deity of the southeast wind.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Scott &amp; Jones, Greek Lexicon.&lt;/ref&gt;  As this wind was thought to cause a refreshing rain particularly beneficial to farmers, he is often depicted wearing high boots and carrying fruit, draped in a light cloth concealing some flowers or grain.  He is clean-shaven, with curly hair and a friendly expression.  Because Apeliotes is a minor god, he was often syncretized with Eurus, the east wind.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}  The Roman counterpart of Apeliotes is '''Subsolanus'''.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius 2.22.1; Pliny the Elder 2.46.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Skiron''' was the name used in Athens for the wind which blew from the Scironian rocks (a geographical feature near [[Kineta]] to the west of Athens).&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Scott, &amp; Jones, Greek Lexicon.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the [[Tower of the Winds]], however, he appears on the northwest side.  His name is related to ''Skirophorion'', the last of the three months of spring in the [[Attic calendar]].  He is depicted as a bearded man tilting a cauldron, representing the onset of winter.  His Roman counterpart is '''Caurus'''&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius 1.6.13.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Corus'''.&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius 1.405. Pliny the Elder 2.48.&lt;/ref&gt;  Caurus is also one of the oldest Roman wind-deities, and numbered among the ''[[di indigetes]]'' ('indigenous gods'), a group of abstract and largely minor [[Numen|numinous]] entities.  The Roman poet [[Virgil]] writes when describing steppe winter weather near the [[Sea of Azov]]:&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, Georgics, 3.356.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Verse translation|Semper hiemps, semper spirantes frigora cauri|Always winter, always the northwest winds breathing cold|lang=la}}

'''Lips''' is the Greek deity of the southwest wind, often depicted holding the [[stern]] of a ship.  His Roman equivalent was '''Africus''', due to the Roman province [[Africa]] being to the southwest of [[Italy]].  This name is thought to be derived from the name of a [[North Africa]]n tribe, the [[Afri]].

Other minor wind deities included:

* '''Argestes''' "clearing", a wind blowing from about the same direction as Skiron (Caurus), and probably another name for it
* '''Aparctias''', sometimes called the north wind instead of Boreas
* '''Thrascias''', the north-northwest wind (sometimes called in Latin Circius)
* '''Euronotus''', the wind blowing from the direction, as its name suggests, between Euros and Notus, that is, a south-southeast wind ('''Euroauster''' to the Romans)
* '''[[Iapyx]]''', the northwest wind about the same as Caurus.  It was this wind, according to [[Virgil]], that carried the fleeing [[Cleopatra]] home to Egypt after she was defeated at the [[battle of Actium]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
* '''Libonotus''', the south-southwest wind, known as '''Austro-Africus''' to the Romans
* '''Meses''', another name for the northwest wind
* '''Olympias''', apparently identified with Skiron/Argestes
* '''Phoenicias''', another name for the southeast wind ('the one blowing from [[Phoenicia]]', due to this land lying to the southeast of Greece)

In [[classical mythology]], '''Cupid''' (Latin '''Cupīdō''' {{IPA-la|kʊˈpiːdoː|}}, meaning "passionate desire") is the god of desire, [[lust|erotic love]], attraction and affection. He is often portrayed as the son of the love goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and the god of war [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. He is also known in Latin as ''{{lang|la|Amor}}'' ("Love"). His [[interpretatio graeca|Greek counterpart]] is [[Eros]].&lt;ref name="Lar"&gt;''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Eros is generally portrayed as a slender winged youth in [[Classical Greece|Classical]] [[ancient Greek art|Greek art]], during the [[Hellenistic period]], he was increasingly portrayed as a chubby boy. During this time, his iconography acquired the [[bow and arrow]] that represent his source of power: a person, or even a deity, who is shot by Cupid's arrow is filled with uncontrollable desire. In myths, Cupid is a minor character who serves mostly to set the plot in motion. He is a main character only in the tale of [[Cupid and Psyche]], when wounded by his own weapons, he experiences the ordeal of love. Although other extended stories are not told about him, his tradition is rich in poetic themes and visual scenarios, such as "Love conquers all" and the retaliatory punishment or torture of Cupid.

In art, Cupid often appears in multiples as the '''Amores''', or ''{{lang|it|amorini}}'' in the later terminology of [[art history]], the equivalent of the Greek [[Erotes (mythology)|erotes]]. Cupids are a frequent motif of both [[ancient Roman art|Roman art]] and later [[Western art]] of the [[classical tradition]]. In the 15th century, the iconography of Cupid starts to become indistinguishable from the [[putto]].

Cupid continued to be a popular figure in the [[Middle Ages]], when under Christian influence he often had a dual nature as Heavenly and Earthly love. In the [[Renaissance]], a renewed interest in classical philosophy endowed him with complex [[allegory|allegorical]] meanings. In contemporary popular culture, Cupid is shown drawing his bow to inspire romantic love, often as an icon of [[Valentine's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;This introduction is based on the entry on "Cupid" in ''The Classical Tradition,'' edited by Anthony Grafton, Glenn W. Most, and Salvatore Settis (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. 244–246.&lt;/ref&gt; Cupid's powers are similar, though not identical, to [[Kamadeva]], the [[Hindu]] god of human love.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Cupīdō'' ('passionate desire') is a derivative of [[Latin]] ''cupiō'', ''cupĕre'' ('to desire'), itself from [[Proto-Italic language|Proto-Italic]] ''*kup-i-'', which may reflect ''*kup-ei-'' ('to desire'; cf. [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]] ''cupras'', [[South Picene language|South Picene]] ''kuprí''). The latter ultimately stems from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] verbal stem ''*kup-(e)i-'' ('to tremble, desire'; cf. [[Old Irish]] ''accobor'' 'desire', [[Sanskrit]] ''prá-kupita''- 'trembling, quaking', [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''kypĕti'' 'to simmer, boil').{{Sfn|de Vaan|2008|p=155}}

==Origins and birth==
[[File:Duquesnoy Cupid prewar photo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Cupid Carving His Bow]]'' (1620s) by [[François Duquesnoy]], [[Bode Museum]], Berlin]]

The Romans [[interpretatio graeca|reinterpreted]] myths and concepts pertaining to the Greek Eros for Cupid in their own literature and art, and medieval and Renaissance mythographers [[conflation|conflate]] the two freely. In the Greek tradition, Eros had a dual, contradictory genealogy. He was among the [[Greek primordial gods|primordial gods]] who came into existence asexually; after his generation, deities were begotten through male-female unions.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Muellner, ''The Anger of Achilles: ''Mễnis'' in Greek Epic'' (Cornell University Press, 1996), pp. 57–58; [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]], "One ... Two ... Three: Erōs," in ''Before Sexuality: The Construction of Erotic Experience in the Ancient Greek World'' (Princeton University Press, 1990), p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hesiod]]'s ''Theogony'', only [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Earth) are older. Before the existence of gender dichotomy, Eros functioned by causing entities to separate from themselves that which they already contained.&lt;ref&gt;Vernant, "One ... Two ... Three: Erōs," p. 465ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the Eros who was pictured as a boy or slim youth was regarded as the child of a divine couple, the identity of whom varied by source. The influential Renaissance mythographer [[Natale Conti]] began his chapter on Cupid/Eros by declaring that the Greeks themselves were unsure about his parentage: Heaven and Earth,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sappho]], fragment 31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ares]] and [[Aphrodite]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Simonides]], fragment 54.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nyx|Night]] and [[Aether (mythology)|Ether]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Acusilaus]], ''[[FGrH]]'' 1A 3 frg. 6C.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Eris (mythology)|Strife]] and [[Zephyros|Zephyr]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], fragment 13. Citations of ancient sources from Conti given by John Mulryan and Steven Brown, ''Natale Conti's ''Mythologiae'' Books I–V'' (Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2006), vol. 1, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek travel writer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], he notes, contradicts himself by saying at one point that Eros welcomed Aphrodite into the world, and at another that Eros was the son of Aphrodite and the youngest of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Natale Conti, ''Mythologiae'' 4.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Latin literature]], Cupid is usually treated as the son of Venus without reference to a father. [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] says that [[Volcanus|Vulcan]], as the husband of Venus, is the father of Cupid.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Octavia'' 560.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]], however, says that there were three Cupids, as well as three Venuses: the first Cupid was the son of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], the second of Mercury and the second Venus, and the third of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and the third Venus. This last Cupid was the equivalent of [[Anteros]], "Counter-Love", one of the [[Erotes (mythology)|Erotes]], the gods who embody aspects of love.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' 3.59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; The multiple Cupids frolicking in art are the decorative manifestation of these proliferating loves and desires. During the [[English Renaissance]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] wrote of "ten thousand Cupids"; in [[Ben Jonson]]'s wedding [[masque]] ''[[Hymenaei]]'', "a thousand several-coloured loves ... hop about the nuptial room".&lt;ref&gt;M.T. Jones-Davies and Ton Hoenselaars, introduction to ''Masque of Cupids'', edited and annotated by John Jowett, in ''Thomas Middleton: The Collected Works'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 1031.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later [[classical tradition]], Cupid is most often regarded as the son of Venus and Mars, whose love affair represented an [[allegory]] of Love and War.&lt;ref name="Cupid-p244"&gt;"Cupid," ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The duality between the primordial and the sexually conceived Eros accommodated philosophical concepts of Heavenly and Earthly Love even in the Christian era.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Cupid," ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes and themes==
[[File:Piero della Francesca - Cupid Blindfolded - WGA17587.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A blindfolded, armed Cupid (1452/66) by [[Piero della Francesca]]]]

Cupid is winged, allegedly because lovers are flighty and likely to change their minds, and boyish because love is irrational. His symbols are the arrow and torch, "because love wounds and inflames the heart". These attributes and their interpretation were established by late antiquity, as summarized by [[Isidore of Seville]] (d. 636 AD) in his ''[[Etymologiae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''Etymologies'' 8.11.80.&lt;/ref&gt; Cupid is also sometimes depicted blindfolded and described as blind, not so much in the sense of sightless—since the sight of the beloved can be a spur to love—as blinkered and arbitrary. As described by [[Shakespeare]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1590s):&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Miles, ''Classical Mythology in English Literature: A Critical Anthology'' (Routledge, 1999), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
Nor hath love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.
And therefore is love said to be a child
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' 1.1.234–239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[Primavera (painting)|Allegory of Spring]]'' (1482), also known by its Italian title ''La Primavera'', Cupid is shown blindfolded while shooting his arrow, positioned above the central figure of Venus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jennifer Speake]] and [[Thomas G. Bergin]], entry on "Cupid," ''Encyclopedia of the Renaissance and the Reformation'' (Market House Books, rev. ed. 2004), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly in ancient Roman art, cupids may also carry or be surrounded by fruits, animals, or attributes of the [[Horae|Seasons]] or the wine-god [[Dionysus]], symbolizing the earth's generative capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Sorabella, "A Roman Sarcophagus and Its Patron," ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'' 36 (2001), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having all these associations, Cupid is considered to share parallels with the Hindu god [[Kamadeva|Kama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roshen Dalal |author-link=Roshen Dalal |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrk0AwAAQBAJ |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |date=2014|isbn=9788184752779 }} Entry: "Kama"&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Bertel Thorvaldsen - Cupid.jpg|Cupid sculpture by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Cupid's arrows===

[[File:Roman de la Rose f. 13r (The god of love shoots an arrow at the lover).jpg|thumb|left|The god of love (Cupid) shoots an arrow at the lover, from a 14th-century text of the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]''.]]
Cupid carries two kinds of arrows, or darts, one with a sharp golden point, and the other with a blunt tip of lead. A person wounded by the golden arrow is filled with uncontrollable desire, but the one struck by the lead feels aversion and desires only to flee. The use of these arrows is described by the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Latin poet]] [[Ovid]] in the first book of his ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. When [[Apollo]] taunts Cupid as the lesser archer, Cupid shoots him with the golden arrow, but strikes the object of his desire, the nymph [[Daphne (mythology)|Daphne]], with the lead. Trapped by Apollo's unwanted advances, Daphne prays to her father, the river god [[Peneus]], who turns her into a laurel, the tree sacred to Apollo. It is the first of several unsuccessful or tragic love affairs for Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 1.463–473.&lt;/ref&gt; This theme is somewhat mirrored in the story of [[Echo and Narcissus]], as the goddess [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] forces the nymph Echo's love upon Narcissus, who is cursed by the goddess [[Nemesis]] to be self absorbed and unresponsive to her desires. &lt;ref&gt;Book III, Ovid's Metamorphoses&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation is found in ''[[The Kingis Quair]]'', a 15th-century poem attributed to [[James I of Scotland]], in which Cupid has three arrows: gold, for a gentle "smiting" that is easily cured; the more compelling silver; and steel, for a love-wound that never heals.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Kingis Quair]]'', lines 92–99; [[Walter W. Skeat]], ''Chaucerian and Other Pieces'' (Oxford University Press, 1897, 1935), sup. vol., note 1315, p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cupid and the bees===

[[File:Cranach, Cupid Complaining to Venus.jpg|thumb|upright|''Cupid the Honey Thief'', by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]]]
In the tale of Cupid the honey thief, the child-god is stung by bees when he steals honey from their hive. He cries and runs to his mother Venus,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Youens, ''Hugo Wolf and His Mörike Songs'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 118: "When he runs crying to his mother Venus".&lt;/ref&gt; complaining that so small a creature shouldn't cause such painful wounds. Venus laughs, and points out the poetic justice: he too is small, and yet delivers the sting of love.

The story was first told about Eros in the ''Idylls'' of [[Theocritus]] (3rd century BC).&lt;ref&gt;Theocritus, ''Idyll'' 19. It also appears in [[Anacreontea|Anacreontic poetry]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was retold numerous times in both art and poetry during the Renaissance. The theme brought the ''[[Amoretti]]'' poetry cycle (1595) of [[Edmund Spenser]] to a conclusion,&lt;ref&gt;Jane Kingsley-Smith, ''Cupid in Early Modern Literature and Culture'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and furnished subject matter for at least twenty works by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and his workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sterling ''et al.'', ''Fifteenth- to Eighteenth-Century European Paintings in the Robert Lehman Collection: France, Central Europe, The Netherlands, Spain, and Great Britain'' (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The German poet and classicist [[Karl Philipp Conz]] (1762–1827) framed the tale as ''[[Schadenfreude]]'' ("taking pleasure in someone else's pain") in a poem by the same title.&lt;ref&gt;Youens, ''Hugo Wolf and His Mörike Songs'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In a version by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], a writer of the [[German Enlightenment]], the incident prompts Cupid to turn himself into a bee:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Through this sting was Amor made wiser.&lt;br&gt;The untiring deceiver&lt;br&gt;concocted another battle-plan:&lt;br&gt;he lurked beneath the carnations and roses&lt;br&gt;and when a maiden came to pick them,&lt;br&gt;he flew out as a bee and stung her.&lt;ref&gt;Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, ''Die Biene''; Youens, ''Hugo Wolf and His Mörike Songs'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The image of Cupid as a bee is part of a complex tradition of poetic imagery involving the flower of youth, the sting of love as a deflowering, and honey as a secretion of love.&lt;ref&gt;Youens, ''Hugo Wolf and His Mörike Songs'', pp. 117–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cupid and dolphins===
[[File:Erasmus Quellinus (II)- Cupido navegando sobre un delfín, 1630.jpg|thumb|''Cupid Riding on a Dolphin'' (1630) by [[Erasmus Quellinus II]]]]
In both ancient and later art, Cupid is often shown riding a [[dolphin]]. On [[ancient Roman sarcophagi]], the image may represent the soul's journey, originally associated with [[Dionysian mysteries|Dionysian religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet Huskinson, ''Roman Children's Sarcophagi: Their Decoration and Its Social Significance'' (Oxford University Press, 1996), ''passim''; Joan P. Alcock, "''Pisces in Britannia'': The Eating and Portrayal of Fish in Roman Britain," in ''Fish: Food from the Waters. Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 1997'' (Prospect Books, 1998), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; A mosaic from late [[Roman Britain]] shows a procession emerging from the mouth of the sea god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], first dolphins and then sea birds, ascending to Cupid. One interpretation of this allegory is that Neptune represents the soul's origin in the matter from which life was fashioned, with Cupid triumphing as the soul's desired destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Perring, "'Gnosticism' in Fourth-Century Britain: The Frampton Mosaics Reconsidered," ''Britannia'' 34 (2003), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other contexts, Cupid with a dolphin recurs as a playful motif, as in garden statuary at [[Pompeii]] that shows a dolphin rescuing Cupid from an octopus, or Cupid holding a dolphin. The dolphin, often elaborated fantastically, might be constructed as a spout for a fountain.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony King, "Mammals: Evidence from Wall Paintings, Sculpture, Mosaics, Faunal Remains, and Ancient Literary Sources," in ''The Natural History of Pompeii'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002), pp. 419–420.&lt;/ref&gt; On a modern-era fountain in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], [[Florence, Italy]], Cupid seems to be strangling a dolphin.&lt;ref&gt;"Archaeological News," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 11.2 (1896), p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolphins were often portrayed in antiquity as friendly to humans, and the dolphin itself could represent affection. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] records a tale of a dolphin at [[Puteoli]] carrying a boy on its back across a lake to go to school each day; when the boy died, the dolphin grieved itself to death.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' 9.8.24; Alcock, "''Pisces in Britannia''," p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In erotic scenes from mythology, Cupid riding the dolphin may convey how swiftly love moves,&lt;ref&gt;Marietta Cambareri and Peter Fusco, catalogue description for a Venus and Cupid, ''Italian and Spanish Sculpture: Catalogue of the J. Paul Getty Museum Collection'' (Getty Publications, 2002), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; or the Cupid astride a sea beast may be a reassuring presence for the wild ride of love.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Puttfarken, ''Titian and Tragic Painting: Aristotle's Poetics And the Rise of the Modern Artist'' (Yale University Press, 2005), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; A dolphin-riding Cupid may attend scenes depicting the wedding of Neptune and [[Amphitrite]] or the Triumph of Neptune, also known as a marine ''[[thiasos]]''.

===Demon of fornication===
To adapt myths for Christian use, medieval mythographers interpreted them morally. In this view, Cupid is seen as a "demon of [[fornication]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Daemon fornicationis'' in Isidore of Seville, ''moechiae daemon'' in Theodulf of Orleans; Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433–1177'' (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 129ff., especially p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; The innovative [[Theodulf of Orleans]], who wrote during the reign of [[Charlemagne]], reinterpreted Cupid as a seductive but malicious figure who exploits desire to draw people into an allegorical underworld of vice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodulf of Orleans]], ''De libris'', ''carmen'' 45; Chance, ''Medieval Mythography,'' p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; To Theodulf, Cupid's quiver symbolized his depraved mind, his bow trickery, his arrows poison, and his torch burning passion. It was appropriate to portray him naked, so as not to conceal his deception and evil.&lt;ref&gt;Theodulf, ''De libris'' 37–38; Chance, ''Medieval Mythography,'' pp. 137, 156, 585. Similar views are expressed by the [[Second Vatican Mythographer]] (II 46/35) and [[Remigius of Auxerre]], ''Commentary on [[Martianus Capella]]'' 8.22.&lt;/ref&gt; This conception largely followed his attachments to lust, but would later be diluted as many Christians embraced Cupid as a symbolic representation of love.

===Sleeping Cupid===
[[File:WLA vanda Sleeping Cupid.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Bronze ''Cupid Sleeping'' on a lion skin (1635–40), signed ''F,'' based on the marble attributed to [[Praxiteles]]]]
Cupid sleeping became a symbol of absent or languishing love in Renaissance poetry and art, including a ''[[Cupid (Michelangelo)|Sleeping Cupid]]'' (1496) by [[Michelangelo]] that is now lost.&lt;ref&gt;"Cupid," ''The Classical Tradition,'' p. 245; Stefania Macioe, "Caravaggio and the Role of Classical Models," in ''The Rediscovery of Antiquity: The Role of the Artist'' (Collegium Hyperboreum, 2003), pp. 437–438.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient type was known at the time through descriptions in classical literature, and at least one extant example had been displayed in the sculpture garden of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] since 1488.&lt;ref&gt;Rona Goffen, ''Renaissance Rivals: Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, Titian'' (Yale University Press, 2002, 2004), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century AD, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] had described two marble versions of a ''Cupid'' (Eros), one at [[Thespiae]] and a nude at [[Parium]], where it was the stained object of erotic fascination.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 36.22, describes it as on a par with the [[Aphrodite of Cnidus|Cnidian Venus]] both in its nobility and in the wrong it had endured, as a certain main from [[Rhodes]] had fallen in love with it and left a visible trace of his love ''(vestigium amoris)''; Goffen, ''Renaissance Rivals,'' p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelangelo's work was important in establishing the reputation of the young artist, who was only twenty at the time. At the request of [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici|his patron]], he increased its value by deliberately making it look "antique",&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Parker, ''Michelangelo and the Art of Letter Writing'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; thus creating "his most notorious fake".&lt;ref&gt;Goffen, ''Renaissance Rivals'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; After the deception was acknowledged, the ''Cupid Sleeping'' was displayed as evidence of his virtuosity alongside an ancient marble, attributed to [[Praxiteles]], of Cupid asleep on a lion skin.&lt;ref&gt;Estelle Lingo, ''François Duquesnoy and the Greek Ideal'' (Yale University Press, 2007), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the poetry of [[Giambattista Marino]] (d. 1625), the image of Cupid or ''Amore'' sleeping represents the indolence of Love in the lap of Idleness. A [[madrigal]] by his literary rival [[Gaspare Murtola]] exhorted artists to paint the theme. A catalogue of works from antiquity collected by the [[House of Mattei|Mattei family]], patrons of [[Caravaggio]], included sketches of sleeping cupids based on sculpture from the [[Temple of Venus Erycina]] in Rome. Caravaggio, whose works Murtola is known for describing, took up the challenge with his 1608 ''[[Sleeping Cupid (Caravaggio)|Sleeping Cupid]]'', a disturbing depiction of an unhealthy, immobilized child with "jaundiced skin, flushed cheeks, bluish lips and ears, the emaciated chest and swollen belly, the wasted muscles and inflamed joints". The model is thought to have suffered from [[juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;John L. Varriano, ''Caravaggio'' (Penn State Press, 2006), pp. 57, 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Caravaggio's sleeping Cupid was reconceived in [[fresco]] by [[Giovanni da San Giovanni]], and the subject recurred throughout Roman and Italian work of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Macioe, "Caravaggio and the Role of Classical Models," p. 436–438.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Love Conquers All''===
[[File:Amor Vincet Omnia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Caravaggio's ''Amor Vincit Omnia'']]]]
Earlier in his career, Caravaggio had challenged contemporary sensibilities with his "sexually provocative and anti-intellectual" ''Victorious Love'', also known as ''[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Love Conquers All]]'' ''(Amor Vincit Omnia)'', in which a brazenly naked Cupid tramples on emblems of culture and erudition representing music, architecture, warfare, and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Varriano, ''Caravaggio'', pp. 22, 123.&lt;/ref&gt;
The motto comes from the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] poet [[Vergil]], writing in the late 1st century BC. His collection of ''[[Eclogues]]'' concludes with what might be his most famous line:&lt;ref&gt;David R. Slavitt, ''Eclogues and Georgics of Virgil'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1971, 1990), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''Omnia vincit Amor: et nos cedamus Amori.''&lt;br&gt;Love conquers all, and so let us surrender ourselves to Love.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vergil]], ''Eclogues'' 10.69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theme was also expressed as the [[Roman triumph|triumph]] of Cupid, as in the ''[[Triumphs]]'' of [[Petrarch]].&lt;ref&gt;Aldo S. Bernardo, ''Petrarch, Laura, and the Triumphs'' (State University of New York, 1974), p. 102ff.; Varriano, ''Caravaggio'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman ''Cupid''==
[[File:Altar Mars Venus Massimo n4.jpg|thumb|left|Fragmentary base for an altar of Venus and Mars, showing cupids handling the weapons and [[biga (chariot)|chariot]] of the war god, from the reign of [[Trajan]] (98–117 AD)]]
The ancient Roman ''Cupid'' was a god who embodied desire, but he had no [[Roman temple|temples]] or religious practices independent of other [[list of Roman deities|Roman deities]] such as Venus, whom he often accompanies as a side figure in cult statues.&lt;ref name="Cupid-p244" /&gt; A Cupid might appear among the several statuettes for private devotion in a [[lararium|household shrine]],&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Kaufmann-Heinimann, "Religion in the House," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no clear distinction between figures for veneration and those displayed as art or decoration.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Clarke, ''Art in the Lives of Ordinary Romans: Visual Representation and Non-Elite Viewers in Italy, 100 B.C.-A.D. 315'' (University of California Press, 2003), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a distinction from his Greek equivalent, [[Eros]], who was commonly worshipped alongside his mother [[Aphrodite]], and was even given a sacred day upon the 4th of every month. &lt;ref&gt;Mikalson, Jon D. (2015). The Sacred and Civil Calendar of the Athenian Year. Princeton University Press. p. 186. ISBN 9781400870325.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman temples often served a secondary purpose as art museums, and [[Cicero]] mentions a statue of "Cupid" (Eros) by [[Praxiteles]] that was consecrated at a ''[[sacellum|sacrarium]]'' and received religious veneration jointly with [[Hercules]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''Against Verres'' 4.2–4; David L. Balch, "From Endymion in Roman ''Domus'' to Jonah in Christian Catacombs: From Houses of the Living to Houses for the Dead. Iconography and Religion in Transition," in ''Commemorating the Dead: Texts and Artifacts in Context. Studies of Roman'' (De Gruyter, 2008), p. 281; Anna Clark, ''Divine Qualities: Cult and Community in Republican Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription from [[Cártama]] in [[Roman Spain]] records statues of Mars and Cupid among the public works of a wealthy female priest ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sacerdos perpetua]])'', and another list of benefactions by a [[Procurator (Roman)|procurator]] of [[Baetica]] includes statues of Venus and Cupid.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard A. Curchin, "Personal Wealth in Roman Spain," ''Historia'' 32.2 (1983), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cupid became more common in [[Roman art]] from the time of [[Augustus]], the first [[Roman emperor]]. After the [[Battle of Actium]], when [[Mark Antony|Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]] were defeated, Cupid transferring the weapons of Mars to his mother Venus became a motif of Augustan imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Brian Rose, "The Parthians in Augustan Rome," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 109.1 (2005), pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', the national epic of Rome by the poet [[Virgil]], Cupid disguises himself as [[Ascanius|Iulus]], the son of [[Aeneas]] who was in turn the son of Venus herself, and in this form he beguiles [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Dido of Carthage]] to fall in love with the hero. She gives safe harbor to Aeneas and his band of refugees from [[Trojan War|Troy]], only to be abandoned by him as he fulfills his destiny to [[Founding of Rome|found Rome]]. Iulus (also known as [[Ascanius]]) becomes the mythical founder of the [[Julia (gens)|Julian family]] from which [[Julius Caesar]] came. Augustus, Caesar's heir, commemorated a beloved great-grandson who died as a child by having him portrayed as Cupid, dedicating one such statue at the Temple of Venus on the [[Capitoline Hill]], and keeping one in his bedroom where he kissed it at night.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Caligula'' 7; Robert Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 2001; originally published in French 1998), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; A brother of this child became the emperor [[Claudius]], whose mother [[Antonia Minor|Antonia]] appears in a surviving portrait-sculpture as Venus, with Cupid on her shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;Susann S. Lusnia, "Urban Planning and Sculptural Display in Severan Rome: Reconstructing the Septizodium and Its Role in Dynastic Politics," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 108.4 (2004), p. 530.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Augustus of Prima Porta]]'' is accompanied by a [[#Cupid riding a dolphin|Cupid riding a dolphin]].&lt;ref&gt;J. C. McKeow, ''A Cabinet of Roman Curiosities'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Cupids in multiples appeared on the [[frieze]]s of the [[Temple of Venus Genetrix]] (Venus as "Begetting Mother"), and influenced scenes of [[relief sculpture]] on other works such as [[ancient Roman sarcophagi|sarcophagi]], particularly those of children.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Huskinson, ''Roman Children's Sarcophagi: Their Decoration and Its Social Significance'' (Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 41ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a winged figure, ''Cupido'' shared some characteristics with the [[Victoria (mythology)|goddess ''Victoria'']].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Divine Qualities,'' p. 199; Huskinson, ''Roman Children's Sarcophagi'', ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; On coinage issued by [[Sulla]] the [[Roman dictator|dictator]], Cupid bears the [[palm branch (symbol)|palm branch]], the most common attribute of Victory.&lt;ref&gt;[[J.

Rufus Fears]], "The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.17.2 (1981), p. 849, note 69.&lt;/ref&gt; was often attached to power as well as to erotic attraction. [[Roman historiography|Roman historians]] criticize ''cupido gloriae'', "desire for glory", and ''cupido [[imperium|imperii]]'', "desire for ruling power".&lt;ref&gt;William V. Harris, ''War and Imperialism in Republican Rome: 327-70 B.C.'' (Oxford University Press, 1979, 1985), pp. 17–18; Sviatoslav Dmitrie, ''The Greek Slogan of Freedom and Early Roman Politics in Greece'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 372; Philip Hardie, ''Rumour and Renown: Representations of ''Fama'' in Western Literature'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), pp. 33, 172, 234, 275, 333ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin philosophical discourse, ''cupido'' is the equivalent of Greek ''[[pothos (mythology)|pothos]]'', a focus of reflections on the meaning and burden of desire. In depicting the "pious love" ''(amor pius)'' of [[Nisus and Euryalus]] in the ''Aeneid,'' Vergil has Nisus wonder:&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it the gods who put passion in men's mind, Euryalus, or does each person's fierce desire ''(cupido)'' become his own God?&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by David Armstrong, ''Vergil, Philodemus, and the Augustans'' (University of Texas Press, 2004), p. 181; ''Aeneid'' 9.184–184: ''dine hunc ardorem mentibus addunt, / Euryale, an sua cuique deus fit dira cupido?''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Epicurean sexuality|Lucretius' physics of sex]], ''cupido'' can represent human lust and an animal instinct to mate, but also the impulse of atoms to bond and form matter.&lt;ref&gt;Diskin Clay, "''De Rerum Natura'': Greek ''Physis'' and Epicurean ''Physiologia'' (Lucretius 1.1–148)," ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' 100 (1969), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; An association of sex and violence is found in the erotic fascination for [[gladiator]]s, who often had sexualized names such as ''Cupido''.&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Versnel, "A Parody on Hymns in Martial V.24 and Some Trinitarian Problems," ''Mnemosyne'' 27.4 (1974), p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cupid was the enemy of [[chastity]], and the poet [[Ovid]] opposes him to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], the virgin goddess of the hunt who likewise carries a bow but who hates Cupid's passion-provoking arrows.&lt;ref&gt;''Tela Cupidinis odit'': Ovid, ''Ars Amatoria'' 1.261; C.M.C. Green, "Terms of Venery: ''Ars Amatoria'' I," ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' 126 (1996), pp. 242, 245.&lt;/ref&gt; Cupid is also at odds with [[Apollo]], the archer-brother of Diana and patron of poetic inspiration whose love affairs almost always end disastrously. Ovid blames Cupid for causing him to write love poetry instead of the more respectable epic.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Armstrong, "Retiring Apollo: Ovid on the Politics and Poetics of Self-Sufficiency," ''Classical Quarterly'' 54.2 (2004) 528–550.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cupid and Psyche==
{{Main article|Cupid and Psyche}}
[[File:Vouet-Psyché-Lyon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|''Psyché et l'amour'' (1626–29) by [[Simon Vouet]]: Psyche lifts a lamp to view the sleeping Cupid.]]

The story of Cupid and Psyche appears in [[ancient Greek art|Greek art]] as early as the 4th century BC, but the most extended literary source of the tale is the Latin novel ''Metamorphoses'', also known as ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', by [[Apuleius]] (2nd century AD). It concerns the overcoming of obstacles to the love between Psyche ("Soul" or "Breath of Life") and Cupid, and their ultimate union in marriage.

The fame of Psyche's beauty threatens to eclipse that of Venus herself, and the love goddess sends Cupid to work her revenge. Cupid, however, becomes enamored of Psyche, and arranges for her to be taken to his palace. He visits her by night, warning her not to try to look upon him. Psyche's envious sisters convince her that her lover must be a hideous monster, and she finally introduces a lamp into their chamber to see him. Startled by his beauty, she drips hot oil from the lamp and wakes him. He abandons her. She wanders the earth looking for him, and finally submits to the service of Venus, who tortures her. The goddess then sends Psyche on a series of quests. Each time she despairs, and each time she is given divine aid. On her final task, she is to retrieve a dose of [[Proserpina]]'s beauty from the underworld. She succeeds, but on the way back can't resist opening the box in the hope of benefitting from it herself, whereupon she falls into a torpid sleep. Cupid finds her in this state, and revives her by returning the sleep to the box. Cupid grants her immortality so the couple can be wed as equals.

The story's [[Neoplatonic]] elements and allusions to [[mystery religions]] accommodate multiple interpretations,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Harrison, entry on "Cupid," ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been analyzed as an [[allegory]] and in light of [[folklore|folktale]], [[Fairy tale#Terminology|Märchen]] or [[fairy tale]], and [[myth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], "Cupid and Psyche," reprinted in ''Pietas: Selected Studies in Roman Religion'' (Brill, 1980), pp. 84–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Often presented as an allegory of love overcoming death, the story was a frequent source of imagery for [[Roman sarcophagi]] and other extant art of antiquity. Since the rediscovery of Apuleius's novel in the [[Renaissance]], the [[reception theory|reception]] of ''Cupid and Psyche'' in the [[classical tradition]] has been extensive. The story has been retold in poetry, drama, and opera, and depicted widely in painting, sculpture, and various media.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, "Cupid and Psyche," in ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also played a role in popular culture as an example for "true love", and is commonly used in relation to the holiday [[Valentine's Day]].

"La Belle et la Bête" ("The Beauty and the Beast") was written by [[Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve]], and then abridged by [[Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont]] in 1740;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://humanitiesresource.com/ancient/articles/Beauty_and_Beast-Final.pdf|title=Beauty and the Beast|date=2011|website=humanitiesresource.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1991 it inspired the Disney movie ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.

==Depictions==

On gems and other surviving pieces, Cupid is usually shown amusing himself with adult play, sometimes driving a hoop, throwing darts, catching a butterfly, or flirting with a [[nymph]]. He is often depicted with his mother (in graphic arts, this is nearly always Venus), playing a horn. In other images, his mother is depicted scolding or even spanking him due to his mischievous nature. He is also shown wearing a helmet and carrying a buckler, perhaps in reference to [[Virgil]]'s ''Omnia vincit amor'' or as [[political satire]] on wars for love, or love as war. Traditionally, Cupid was portrayed nude in the style of Classical art, but more modern depictions show him wearing a diaper, sash, and/or wings.

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
'''Neptune''' ({{lang-la|Neptūnus}} {{IPA-la|nɛpˈtuːnʊs|}}) is the Roman [[List of water deities|god of freshwater and the sea]]&lt;ref&gt;J. Toutain, ''Les cultes païens de l'Empire romain'', vol. I (1905:378) securely identified Italic Neptune as a saltwater sources as well as the sea.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]. He is the counterpart of the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] [[Poseidon]].&lt;ref name=Lar&gt;''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[interpretatio graeca|Greek tradition]], he is a brother of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]; the brothers preside over the realms of [[heaven]], the earthly world (including the [[Hades|underworld]]), and the seas.&lt;ref&gt;About the relationship of the lord of our earthly world with water(s) Bloch, p. 342-346, gives the following explanations:

1. [[Poseidon]] is originally conceived as a [[chthonic]] god, lord and husband of the Earth (for the etymolog gearoid γαιήοχος, he who possesses the Earth, εννοσίδας he who makes the Earth quake) with an equine form. He mates with [[Demeter]] under this form in the Arcadian myth from [[Thelpusa]], they beget the racing horse [[Areion]] and the unnamed daughter of those mysteries (story in [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] VIII 25, 3). 
2. Poseidon ''hippios'' (horse) is the god of Earth and as springs come from beneath the earth, this is also a metaphora (or better a figure) of the origin of life on Earth;  the horse is universally considered as having a psychopompous character and Poseidon is known as tamer of  horses (''damaios'') and father of [[Pegasus]] who with its hoof can open up a spring.

3. Poseidon is the god worshipped in the main temple of the Isle of [[Atlantis]] in the myth narrated by [[Plato]] in the dialogues Timaeus and Critias; there was also a hippodrome nearby.

4. The island was swallowed up by an earthquake caused by Poseidon himself. This factor would connect the power over earth and that over waters. The Greek had a memory of the explosion of the Island of [[Santorini]] and of the seaquake it provoked as well as other consequences affecting climate.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salacia]] is his wife.

Depictions of Neptune in Roman [[mosaic]]s, especially those in [[Africa (Roman province)|North Africa]], were influenced by [[Hellenistic]] conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Cadotte, "Neptune Africain", ''Phoenix'' 56. 3/4 (Autumn/Winter 2002:330-347) detected [[Sytncretism|syncretic]] traces of a Libyan/Punic agrarian god of fresh water sources, with the epithet ''Frugifer'', "fruit-bearer"; Cadotte enumerated (p.332) some north African Roman mosaics of the fully characteristic ''Triumph of Neptune'', whether riding in his chariot or mounted directly on albino dolphins.&lt;/ref&gt; He was likely associated with freshwater springs before the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil, ''La religion romaine archaïque'', 381, Paris, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Poseidon, he was also worshipped by the Romans as a god of horses, as ''Neptunus equestris'' (a [[patron god|patron]] of horse-racing).&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Epona]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Neptune, Prado Museum, Madrid at Spain is culture.|url=http://www.spainisculture.com/obras_de_excelencia/museo_nacional_del_prado/neptuno_e00003.html?l=en%7Curl-|access-date=2021-12-20|website=www.spainisculture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[theology]] of Neptune is limited by his close identification with the Greek god [[Poseidon]], one of many members of the [[Greek mythology|Greek pantheon]] whose theology was later tied to a [[List of Roman deities|Roman deity]].{{sfn|Bloch|1981|pp=341–344}} The ''[[lectisternium]]'' of 399 BC indicated that the Greek figures of Poseidon, [[Artemis]], and [[Heracles]] had been introduced and worshipped in Rome as Neptune, Diana, and Hercules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Showerman |first1=Grant |title=The Great Mother of the Gods |date=1901 |publisher=University of Wisconsin, Madison |location=Madison, WI |page=223 |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Grant_Showerman_The_Great_Mother_of_the_Gods?id=5bJhAAAAMAAJ |access-date=August 10, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that Neptune has been conflated with a [[Proto-Indo-European]] freshwater deity; since the Indo-Europeans lived inland and had little direct knowledge of the sea, the Romans may have reused the theology of a previous freshwater god in their worship of Neptune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wissowa |first1=Georg |title=Religion und Kultus der Römer |date=1902 |publisher=C. H. Beck |location=Munchen |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Domaszewski |first1=Alfred |title=Abhandlungen zur römische Religion |date=1909 |publisher=Teubner |location=Leipzig and Berlin |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Servius (grammarian)|Servius]] explicitly names Neptune as the god of rivers, springs, and waters;{{sfn|Bloch|1981|p=346}} he may parallel the Irish god [[Nechtan (mythology)|Nechtan]], master of rivers and wells.{{cn|date=August 2021}} This is in contrast to Poseidon, who was primarily a god of the sea.{{sfn|Bloch|1981}}

Neptune has been associated with a number of other Roman deities. By the first century BC, he had supplanted [[Portunus (mythology)|Portunus]] as the god of naval victories; [[Sextus Pompeius]] called himself the "son of Neptune".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox |first=Robin Lane |title=The Classical World |date=2006 |publisher=Basic Books |page=412 |isbn=0-465-02496-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, Neptune was paired in his dominion of the sea with [[Salacia]], the goddess of [[saltwater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=van Aken |first=A. R. A. |title=Elsevier's Mythologische Encyclopedie |date=1961 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neptune was considered the legendary progenitor god of the [[Falisci]] (who called themselves ''Neptunia proles''), joining [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Janus]], [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] as the deific father of a Latin tribe.{{sfn|Fowler|1912|p=186}} 

===Neptunalia===
[[Neptunalia]], the Roman festival of Neptune, was held at the height of summer (typically on July 23). The date of the festival and the construction of tree-branch shelters suggest that Neptune was a god of water sources in times of drought and heat.&lt;ref&gt;"C'est-à-dire au plus fort de l'été, au moment de la grande sécheresse, et qu'on y construisaient des huttes de feuillage en guise d'abris contre le soleil" (Cadotte 2002:342, noting [[Sextus Pompeius Festus]], ''De verborum significatu'' [ed. Lindsay 1913] 519.1)&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient [[Roman calendar]] set the ''[[feriae]]'' of Neptunus on July 23, between the [[Lucaria]] festival of the grove and the [[Furrinalia]] festival of July 25. All three festivals were connected to water during the period of summer heat (''canicula'') and drought, when freshwater sources were lowest.&lt;ref name="dumezil n"&gt;G. Dumézil ''Fêtes romaines d' été et d' automne. Suivi de Dix questions romaines'' Paris 1975 1. "Les eaux et les bois" p. 25-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been speculated that the three festivals fall in a logical order. The ''Lucaria'' was devoted to clearing overgrown bushes and uprooting and burning excess vegetation.&lt;ref name="dumezil n" /&gt; Neptunalia followed, devoted to conservation and the draining of superficial waters. These culminated in the ''Furrinalia'', sacred to [[Furrina]] (the goddess of springs and wells).

Neptunalia was spent under branch huts in a woods between the [[Tiber]] and the [[Via Salaria]], with participants drinking spring water and wine to escape the heat.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'', vol. 1, pt 2:323; [[Varro]], ''De lingua Latina'' vi.19.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a time of merrymaking, when men and women could mix without the usual Roman societal constraints.&lt;ref name=Takas_2008&gt;Sarolta A. Takacs ''Vestal virgins, sibyls and matronae: women in Roman religion'' 2008, University of Texas Press, p. 53 f., citing Horace  ''Carmina'' III 28.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an added context of agricultural fertility in the festival, since Neptune received the sacrifice of a bull.&lt;ref&gt;Sarolta A. Takacs 2008; citing Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 10, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temples===
Neptune had only one temple in [[Rome]]. It stood near the [[Circus Flaminius]], the Roman racetrack in the southern part of the [[Campus Martius]], and dates back to at least 206 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]] 17 fragment 57. 60 as cited by L. Richardson jr. ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' 1992 p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was restored out by [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32 BC)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]] c. 40 BC, an event depicted on a coin struck by the consul. Within the temple was a sculpture of a marine group by [[Scopas]] Minor.&lt;ref&gt;On the issue of this group by Scopas cf. F. Coarelli "L'ora di Domizio Enobarbo e la cultura artistica in Roma nel II sec. a. C." in ''Dialoghi di Arrcheologia'' II  '''3''' 1968 p. 302-368.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.mmdtkw.org/VNeptunalia.html |title=Neptunalia Festival |first=Thomas K. |last=Wukitsch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Basilica Neptuni was later built on the Campus Martius, and was dedicated by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] in honor of the naval [[Battle of Actium|victory of Actium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/basilicae.html |first1=Samuel |last1=Ball Platner |first2=Thomas |last2=Ashby |title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, "Basilica Neptuni" |location=London |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; This basilica supplanted the older temple, which had replaced an ancient altar.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil 1977 p. 340, who cites Livy ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri]]'' XXVIII 11, 4. Bloch 1981 p. 347 n. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacrifices===
Neptune is one of only four Roman gods to whom it was considered appropriate to sacrifice a bull. The other three were [[Apollo]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], although [[Vulcan (mythology)|Jupiter]] has also been depicted with the offering of a red bull and a red-bull calf.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 10,4&lt;/ref&gt; If an incorrect offering was presented, either inadvertently or due to necessity, additional [[propitiation]] was required to avoid divine retribution. This type of offering implied a stricter connection between the deity and the world.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil "Quaestiunculae indo-italicae: 11. Iovi tauro verre ariete immolari non licet" ''Revue d' Etudes Latins'' '''39''' 1961 p. 241-250.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paredrae===
''Paredrae'' are entities who accompany a god, representing the fundamental aspects (or powers) of that god. With Hellenic influence, these ''paredrae'' came to be considered separate deities and consorts of their associated god.&lt;ref&gt;William Warde Fowler ''The Religious experience of the Roman People'' London, 1912, p. 346f.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier folk belief might have also identified ''paredrae'' as consorts of their god.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius ''Noctes Atticae'' XIII 24, 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Salacia and [[Venilia]] have been discussed by ancient and modern scholars. Varro connects Salacia to ''salum'' (sea), and Venilia to ''ventus'' (wind).&lt;ref&gt;Varro Lingua Latina V 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Festus attributed to Salacia the motion of the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Festus p. L s.v.&lt;/ref&gt; Venilia brought waves to the shore, and Salacia caused their retreat out to sea.&lt;ref name="Augustine-p22"&gt;Varro apud Augustine ''[[The City of God|De Civitate Dei]]'' VII 22.&lt;/ref&gt; They were examined by the Christian philosopher [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], who devoted a chapter of ''[[The City of God|De Civitate Dei]]'' to ridiculing inconsistencies in the theological definition of the entities; since Salacia personified the deep sea, Augustine wondered how she could also be the retreating waves (since waves are a surface phenomenon).&lt;ref name="Augustine-p22" /&gt; He wrote elsewhere that Venilia would be the "hope that comes", an aspect (or power) of Jupiter understood as ''[[anima mundi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine above II 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Servius, in his commentary on the ''[[Aeneid]]'', wrote about Salacia and Venilia in V 724: "''([[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]) dicitur et Salacia, quae proprie meretricum dea appellata est a veteribus''"; "(Venus) is also called Salacia, who was particularly named goddess of prostitutes by the ancient". Elsewhere, he wrote that Salacia and Venilia are the same entity.&lt;ref name="Fowler_appendix"&gt;William Warde Fowler ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' London, 1912, Appendix II.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among modern scholars, Dumézil and his followers Bloch and Schilling centre their interpretation of Neptune on the direct, concrete, limited value and functions of water. Salacia would represent the forceful, violent aspect of gushing and overflowing water and Venilia the tranquil, gentle aspect of still (or slowly-flowing) water. According to Dumézil,&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil accepts and re-proposes the interpretations of Wissowa and von Domaszewski.&lt;/ref&gt; Neptune's two ''paredrae'' (Salacia and Venilia) represent the overpowering and  tranquil aspects of water, natural and domesticated: Salacia the gushing, overbearing waters, and Venilia the still (or quietly-flowing) waters.&lt;ref&gt;Dumezil above p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

Preller, Fowler, Petersmann and Takács attribute to the theology of Neptune broader significance as a god of universal worldly fertility, particularly relevant to agriculture and human reproduction. They interpret Salacia as personifying lust, and Venilia as related to ''venia'': ingratiating attraction, connected with love and the desire for reproduction. [[Ludwig Preller]] cited a significant aspect of Venilia; she was recorded in the ''[[indigitamenta]]'' as a deity of longing or desire. According to Preller, this would explain a theonym similar to that of Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Preller ''Römische Mythologie'' Berlin, 1858 part II, p.121-2; Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' VIII 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Other data seem to agree; Salacia would parallel [[Thetis]] as the mother of Achilles, and Venilia would be the mother of [[Turnus]] and [[Iuturna]] by [[Daunus]] (king of the [[Rutulians]]). According to another source, Venilia would be the partner of [[Janus]], with whom she mothered the nymph [[Canens (mythology)|Canens]] (loved by [[Picus]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Metamorphoses'' XIV 334.&lt;/ref&gt; These mythical data underline the reproductive function envisaged in the figures of Neptune's ''paredrae'', particularly that of Venilia, in childbirth and motherhood. A legendary king [[Venulus]] was remembered at [[Tibur]] and [[Lavinium]].&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Preller above, citing Servius; C. J. Mackie "Turnus and his ancestors" in ''The Classical Quarterly'' (New Series) 1991, 41, pp. 261-265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neptunus equestris==
{{see also|Consus}}
Before Poseidon was known as the god of the sea, he was connected to the horse and may have originally been depicted in equine form. This connection reflects the violent and brutal nature of Poseidon the earth-shaker, the linkage of horses and springs, and the animal's [[psychopomp]]ous character.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch 1981 p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Neptune, in contrast, has no such direct connection with horses. The Roman deity [[Consus]] was associated with the horse, and his underground altar was in the valley of the [[Circus Maximus]] at the foot of the [[Palatine]] (the site of horse races). On the summer [[Consualia]] (August 21) it was customary to bring horses and mules, crowned with flowers, in procession and then hold equine races in the Circus.&lt;ref name= "Fowler 1899"&gt;William Warde Fowler ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London, 1899, p.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival also traditionally reenacted the abduction of the Sabine (and Latin) women, reflecting the sexual license characteristic of such festivals.&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Fowler, citing James G. Frazer.&lt;/ref&gt;  On that day, the [[Flamen Quirinalis]] and the [[Vestal Virgin]]s made sacrifices on the underground altar of Consus. The proximity of the two [[Consualia]] to the [[Opiconsivia]] (the latter were four days later, the winter festival on December 19) indicates the  relationship between the two deities pertaining to agriculture. According to Dumézil, the horse has a much-different symbolic value in the theologies of Poseidon and Consus. Tertullian (''De Spectaculis'' V 7) wrote that according to Roman tradition, Consus was the god who advised [[Romulus]] on the abduction of the Sabines.&lt;ref&gt;S. Dušanić, Ž. Petković "The Flamen Quirinalis at  the Consualia and the Horseman of the Lacus Curtius" in ''Aevum'' 2002 1. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps influenced by Poseidon Ίππιος, Consus (whose festival included horse races) was reinterpreted as ''Neptunus equestris''; for his underground altar, he was identified with Poseidon Ένοσίχθων. The etymology of ''Poseidon'', derived from ''Posis'' (lord or husband) and ''De'' (grain or earth) may have contributed to the identification of Consus with Neptune.&lt;ref&gt;Sarolta A. Takacs ''Vestal Virgins, Sybils and Matrons'' University of Texas Press 2008 p. 55-56, also citing Scullard on the influence of horse races in the identification. Bloch 1981 citing Chantraine DELG ''s.v.'' Poseidon.&lt;/ref&gt; His arcane cult, which required the unearthing of the altar, indicate the deity's antiquity and [[chthonic]] nature. From Augustine (''De Civitate Dei'' IV 8, about the role of Tutilina in assuring the safety of stored grain), Dumézil interprets its name as deriving from ''condere'' (to hide or store) as a verbal noun similar to [[Sancus]] and [[Janus]]: the god of stored grains.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the related deities of the Circus Semonia, Seia, Segetia, Tutilina: Tertullian ''De Spectaculis'' VIII 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A direct identification of Consus with Poseidon is hindered by the fact that Poseidon is nowhere worshipped at underground shrines or altars.&lt;ref&gt;G. Capdeville "Jeux athletiques et rituels de fondation" ''Revue de l' histoire des religions''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martianus Capella places Neptune and Consus together in region X of Heaven, possibly following an old ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'' of Consus or reflecting an Etruscan idea of a chthonic Neptune apparent in the recommendation of the ''De Haruspicum Responso''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Haruspicum Responso'' 20. Neptunus is mentioned third after Jupiter and Saturn and before Tellus.&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Propitiation|propitiating]] Neptune for the cracking sounds heard underground in the ''ager latiniensis''.{{clarify|date=August 2021|reason=What does ''ager latiniensis'' mean?}} The Etruscans were also fond of horse races.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bloch 1981; G. Capdeville "Les dieux de Martianus Capella" in ''Revue de l'Histoire des Religions'' 213-3, 1996, p. 282 n. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etruria==
The Etruscan name of Neptune is [[Nethuns]]. It had been believed that Neptune derived from [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], but this view has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch 1981 p. 348.{{cite book | author-link = Giuliano Bonfante | last = Bonfante | first =  Giuliano |author2=Bonfante, Larissa |author-link2=Larissa Bonfante  | title = The Etruscan Language: an Introduction | location = Manchester | publisher = University of Manchester Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7190-5540-7 }} p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=De Grummond, Nancy Thomson | year=2006 | title=Etruscan Mythology, Sacred History and Legend: An Introduction | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology | isbn=1-931707-86-3}} p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Nethuns was apparently important to the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]]. His name is found in two places on the [[Liver of Piacenza]]: on the outer rim of section seven, and on the [[gallbladder]] of section 28. This last location aligns with Pliny the Elder's belief that the gallbladder was sacred to Neptune.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bloch 1981; Pliny ''Nat. Hist.'' XI 195&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Nethuns'' occurs eight times in columns VII, IX, and XI of the ''[[Liber Linteus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;N. Thomas De Grummond ''Etruscam Myth, Sacred History and Legend'' Univ. of Pennsylvania Press 2006 p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a mirror from [[Tuscania]] (E. S. 1. 76), Nethuns is represented talking to [[Uśil]] (the sun) and [[Thesan]] (the goddess of dawn). Nethuns is seated on the left, holding a double-ended trident in his right hand and with his left arm raised as if giving instructions. Uśil is standing in the centre, holding [[Apollo|Aplu]]'s bow in his right hand. Thesan is on the right, with her right hand on Uśil's shoulder; both are listening intently to Nethuns' words. The identification of Uśil with Aplu (and his association with Nethuns) is emphasised by an [[anguiped]] demon holding two dolphins on an [[Coin#Modern features|exergue]]. The scene highlights the identities and association of Nethuns and Aplu (here identified as Uśil) as main deities of the worldly realm and the life cycle. Thesan and Uśil-Aplu, who has been identified with Śuri (Soranus Pater, the underworld sun god) clarify the transience of earthly life.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Simon "Gods in Harmony: The Etruscan Pantheon" in N.

Neptune is a god of fertility, including human fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Preller ''Römische Mythologie'' Berlin, 1858, II p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stephen Weinstock, Jupiter is present in each of the first three regions with different aspects related to each region; Neptune should have been in the second region, and Pluto in the third. The reason for Neptune's displacement to region X is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974 2nd, Appendix; It. tr. p. 584; citing Stephen Weinstock "Martianus Capella and the Cosmic System of the Etruscans" in ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 36, 1946, p. 104 ff.; G. Capdeville "Les dieux de Martianus Capella" in ''Revue de l'Histoire des Religions'' 213-3, 1996, p. 280-281&lt;/ref&gt; It is consistent with the collocation in the third quadrant of the deities related to the human world.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. M. Pallottino "Deorum sedes"  in ''Saggi di antichitá. II. Documenti per la storia della civiltá etrusca'' Roma 1979 p. 779-790. For a summary exposition of the content of this work the reader is referred to article [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], section Etrurian Uni note n. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etruscan Penates===
[[Arnobius]] provides information about the theology of Neptune. Neptune and [[Apollo]] were considered Etruscan [[Penates]], and the deities were credited with giving [[Troy|Ilium]] its walls. In another tradition based on the same source, the Etruscan Penates were [[Fortuna]], [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], [[Genius Iovialis]] and [[Pales]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 40, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Villa Carmiano Triclinio 1 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Neptune and [[Amymone]], fresco in [[Stabiae]], Italy, 1st century]]
The etymology of the Latin ''Neptunus'' is unclear and disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Michiel de Vaan, ''Etymological Dictionary of Latin and the other Italic Languages'', Leiden/Boston 2004, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient grammarian [[Varro]] derived the name from ''nuptus'' ("covering", ''opertio''), alluding to ''nuptiae'' ("the marriage of Heaven and Earth").&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''Lingua Latina'' V 72: ''Neptunus, quod mare terras obnubuit ut nubes caelum, ab nuptu, id est opertione, ut antiqui, a quo nuptiae, nuptus dictus.'': "N., because the sea covered the lands as the clouds the sky, from ''nuptus'' i.e. "covering", as the ancients (used to say), whence ''nuptiae'' marriage, was named ''nuptus''".&lt;/ref&gt;

Among modern scholars, [[Paul Kretschmer]] proposed a derivation from the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ''*neptu-'' ("moist substance").&lt;ref&gt;P. Kretschmer ''Einleitung in der Geschichte der Griechischen Sprache'' Göttingen, 1896, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond Bloch similarly theorised that it might be an adjectival form (''-no'') of ''*nuptu-'' ("he who is moist").&lt;ref&gt;R. Bloch "Quelques remarques sur Poseidon, Neptunus et Nethuns" in ''Revue de l' Histoire des Religions'' (1981), p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Dumézil]] said that words deriving from the root ''*nep-'' are not attested in Indo-European languages other than [[Vedic Sanskrit]] and [[Avestan]]. He proposed an etymology which joins ''Neptunus'' with the Indian and Iranian theonyms [[Apam Napat]] and Apam Napá and the Old Irish theonym [[Nechtan (mythology)|Nechtan]], all meaning "descendant of the waters". Using a [[Comparative linguistics|comparative]] approach, the Indo-Iranian, Avestan and Irish figures have common features with the Roman legends about Neptune. Dumézil proposed to derive the nouns from the Indo-European root ''népōts-'' ("descendant, sister's son").&lt;ref&gt;Y. Bonnefoy, W. Doniger ''[https://books.google.nl/books?id=Uf2_kHAs22sC&amp;pg=PA138 Roman and Indoeuropean Mythologies]'' Chicago, 1992, p. 138-139, s.v. Neptune, citing G. Dumezil ''Myth et Epopée'' vol. III, p. 41 and Alfred Ernout- Atoine Meillet ''Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue latine'' Paris, 1985 4th, s.v. Neptunus.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''Fêtes romaines d' étè et d' automne, suivi par dix questions romaines'', p. 25, Paris 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; His former student, [[Indo-Europeanist]] [[Jaan Puhvel]], theorises that the name might have meant "child (''neve'', nephew) of the water" as part of an [[Proto-Indo-European mythology#Fire in water|Indo-European fire-in-water myth]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaan Puhvel, ''Comparative Mythology'', Baltimore 1987, p. 277-283.&lt;/ref&gt;

A different etymology, grounded in the legendary history of Latium and Etruria, was proposed by the 19th-century scholars [[Ludwig Preller]], [[Karl Otfried Müller]] and [[Wilhelm Deeke]]. The name of the Etruscan deity [[Nethuns]] or Nethunus (''NÈDVNVZ'') would be an adjectival form of the toponym Nepe(t) or Nepete (present-day [[Nepi]]), near [[Falerii]]. The district was traditionally connected to the cult of Neptune, and [[Messapus]] and [[Halaesus|Halesus]] (the eponymous hero of Falerii) were believed to be his sons. Messapus led the Falisci (and others) to war in the ''[[Aeneid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Vergil ''Aeneis'', VII, p. 691: L. Preller ''Römische Mythologie'', vol. 2, Berlin, 1858; Müller-Deeke ''Etrusker'' II 54 n. 1 b; Deeke ''Falisker'' p. 103, as quoted by William Warde Fowler ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London, 1899, p. 185 and n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Nepi and Falerii have been known since antiquity for the quality of their meadow springwater. ''Nepet'' might be considered a hydronymic toponym of pre-Indo-European origin from a noun meaning "damp wide valley, plain", a cognate of the [[Proto-Greek language|proto-Greek]] ''νάπη'' ("wooded vale, chasm").&lt;ref&gt;Robert S.P. Beekes, ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Leiden/Boston 2010, p. 996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fertility deity and divine ancestor===

In lectures delivered during the 1990s, German scholar Hubert Petersmann proposed an etymology from the Indo-European root ''*nebh-'' ("damp, wet") with the suffix ''-tu'' (for an abstract verbal noun) and the adjectival suffix ''-no'' (domain of activity). The root ''*nebh-'' gives the Sanskrit ''nābhah'', Hittite ''nepis'', Latin ''nubs'', ''nebula'', German ''Nebel'', and the Slavic ''nebo''. The concept would be close to that expressed in the name of the Greek god ''Όυράνος'' (''[[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]''), derived from the root ''*h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;wórso-'' ("to water or irrigate") and ''*h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;worsó-'' ("the irrigator").&lt;ref&gt;H. Petersmann below, Göttingen 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Peters "Untersuchungen zur Vertratung der indogermanischen Laryngeale in Griechisch" in ''Österreicher Akademie der Wissenschaften, philosophische historische Klasse'', vol. 372, Vienna 1980, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Petersmann proposes a different interpretation of Neptune's theology.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Petersmann ''Lingua et Religio: ausgewählte kleine Schriften zur antiken Religionsgeschichte auf sprachwissenschaftlicher Grundlage'' herausgegeben von Bernd Heßen. Hypomnemata: Supplement-Reihe 1.   Göttingen:  Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, 2002.  Pp. 304.  {{ISBN|3-525-25231-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Developing his understanding of the theonym as rooted in the Indo-European ''*nebh'', he writes that the god would be an ancient deity of the cloudy, rainy sky in company with (and in opposition to) [[Zeus]]/[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the god of clear skies. Similar to [[Caelus]], he would be the father of all earthly things through the fertilising power of rain. The ''[[hieros gamos]]'' of Neptune and Earth is reflected in Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' V 14 (''pater Neptunus''). Neptune's power would be reflected by [[Salacia]], one of his ''paredrae'', who also denotes the overcast sky. His other ''paredra'', [[Venilia]], is associated with the wind as well as the sea. The [[theonym]] Venilia may be rooted in ''*venilis'', a postulated adjective deriving from the IE root ''*ven(h)'' ("to love or desire") in the Sanskrit ''vánati, vanóti'' ("he loves"), German ''Wonne'', and the Latin [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], ''venia''. Neptune's dual nature is found in [[Catullus]] 31. 3: "''uterque Neptunus''".&lt;ref&gt;Catullus 31. 3: "Paene insularum, Sirmio, insularumque/ ocelle, quascumque in liquentibus stagnis/ marique vasto fert uterque Neptunus/...": the quoted words belong to a passage in which the poet seems to be hinting to the double nature of Neptune as god both of the freshwaters and of the sea.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Petersmann, the ancient Indo-Europeans also venerated a god of wetness as the generator of life; this is indicated by the [[Hittite mythology and religion|Hittite theonyms]] ''nepišaš (D)IŠKURaš'' or ''nepišaš (D)Tarhunnaš'' ("lord of sky wet"), the sovereign of Earth and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Neun ''Die Anitta-Text'' Wiesbaden, 1974, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this function was transferred to Zeus/Jupiter (the sovereigns of weather), the old function survived in literature: the ''Aeneid'' V 13-14 reads, "''Heu, quianam tanti cinxerunt aethera nimbi?/ quidve, pater Neptune, paras?''" ("What, why have so many clouds enringed the sky? What are you preparing, father Neptune?")&lt;ref&gt;H. Petersmann "Neptuns ürsprugliche Rolle im römischen Pantheon. Ein etymologisch-religiongeschichtlicher Erklärungsversuch" in ''Lingua et religio. Augewählte kleine Beiträge zur antike religiogeschichtlicher und sprachwissenschaftlicher Grundlage'' Göttingen, 2002, pp. 226-235.&lt;/ref&gt; The indispensability of water and its connexion to reproduction are universally known.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Festus s. v. ''aqua'': "a qua iuvamur", whence we get life, p 2 L.; s. v. ''aqua et igni'' : "...quam accipiuntur nuptae, videlicet quia hae duae res...vitam continent", p.2-3 L; s.v. ''facem'': "facem in nuptiis in honore Cereris praeferebant, aqua aspergebatur nova nupta...ut ignem et aquam cum viro communicaret", p.87 L.&lt;/ref&gt;

Müller and Deeke interpreted Neptune's theology as a divine ancestor of the Latin Faliscans: the father of [[Messapus]] and Halesus, their heroic founders. [[William Warde Fowler]] considered Salacia the personification of the virile potency which generated a Latin people, parallel with Mars, Saturn, Janus and Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;William Warde Fowler ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' London, 1899, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Etruscan representations of Neptune are rare but significant. The oldest may be a fourth-century BC carved [[carnelian]] [[Scarab (artifact)|scarab]] from [[Vulci]] of Nethuns kicking a rock and creating a spring (Paris: Bibliothèque Nationale, [[Cabinet des Medailles]]. Another Etruscan artifact (''Nethunus'', from the Luynes collection) depicts the god causing a horse to spring from the earth with a blow of his trident.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Heurgon]], in Bloch 1981 p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

A late-fourth-century bronze mirror in the [[Vatican Museums]] (Museo Gregoriano Etrusco: C.S.E. Vaticano 1.5a) depicts Neptune with [[Amymone]] (daughter of [[Danaus]]), whom he saves from assault by a satyr and teaches the art of creating springs. On a bronze mirror from Tuscania dated to 350 BC, also in the Vatican Museums (Museo Gregoriano Etrusco E. S. 1. 76), Nethuns is talking to Usil and Thesan. He holds a double-ended trident, suggesting that he might be able wield lightning bolts.&lt;ref&gt;N.T. De Grummond 2006 p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hercules''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɜːr|k|j|ʊ|ˌ|l|iː|z}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|k|j|ə|-|}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Collins Dictionary|Hercules}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the Roman equivalent of the Greek [[divinity|divine]] [[hero]] [[Heracles]], son of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and the mortal [[Alcmene|Alcmena]]. In [[classical mythology]], Hercules is famous for his strength and for his numerous far-ranging adventures.

The Romans adapted the Greek hero's [[iconography]] and myths for their literature and art under the name ''Hercules''. In later [[Western art]] and literature and in [[popular culture]], ''Hercules'' is more commonly used than ''Heracles'' as the name of the hero. Hercules is a multifaceted figure with contradictory characteristics, which enabled later artists and writers to pick and choose how to represent him.&lt;ref&gt;"Hercules," in ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; This article provides an introduction to representations of Hercules in the [[classical tradition|later tradition]].

==Mythology==

===Birth and early life===
In Roman mythology, although Hercules was seen as the champion of the weak and a great protector, his personal problems started at birth. [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] sent two witches to prevent the birth, but they were tricked by one of [[Alcmene]]'s servants and sent to another room. Juno then sent [[Snake| serpents]] to kill him in his cradle, but Hercules strangled them both. In one version of the myth, Alcmene abandoned her baby in the woods in order to protect him from Juno's wrath, but he was found by the goddess [[Minerva]] who brought him to Juno, claiming he was an orphan child left in the woods who needed nourishment. Juno suckled Hercules at her own breast until the infant bit her nipple, at which point she pushed him away, spilling her milk across the night sky and so forming the [[Milky Way]]. She then gave the infant back to Minerva and told her to take care of the baby herself. In feeding the child from her own breast, the goddess inadvertently imbued him with further strength and power.

===Death===

==Roman era==
{{Main article|Hercules in ancient Rome|Heracles}}

[[File:Herakles snake Musei Capitolini MC247.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Baby Hercules strangling a [[snake]] sent to kill him in his [[Bassinet|cradle]] (Roman marble, 2nd century CE, in the [[Capitoline Museums]] of [[Rome]], Italy).]]

The [[Latin]] name ''Hercules'' was borrowed through [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], where it is represented variously as [[Hercle|Heracle]], Hercle, and other forms. Hercules was a favorite subject for [[Etruscan art]], and appears often on [[bronze mirror]]s. The Etruscan form ''Herceler''&lt;!--is this right?--&gt; derives from the Greek ''Heracles'' via [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]]. A mild oath invoking Hercules (''Hercule!'' or ''Mehercle!'') was a common [[interjection]] in [[Classical Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Lindsay, "Mehercle and Herc(v)lvs. [Mehercle and Herc(u)lus]" ''The Classical Quarterly'' '''12'''.2 (April 1918:58).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hercules had a number of [[Roman mythology|myths]] that were distinctly Roman. One of these is Hercules' defeat of [[Cacus]], who was terrorizing the countryside of Rome. The hero was associated with the [[Aventine Hill]] through his son [[Aventinus (mythology)|Aventinus]]. [[Mark Antony]] considered him a personal patron god, as did the emperor [[Commodus]]. Hercules received various forms of [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious veneration]], including as a [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|deity concerned with children and childbirth]], in part because of myths about his precocious infancy, and in part because he fathered countless children. Roman brides wore a special belt tied with the "[[Hercules knot|knot of Hercules]]", which was supposed to be hard to untie.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] 55 (edition of Lindsay); [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 142; Karen K. Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 101, 110, 211.&lt;/ref&gt; The comic playwright [[Plautus]] presents the myth of Hercules' conception as a sex comedy in his play ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]''; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] wrote the tragedy ''Hercules Furens'' about his bout with madness. During the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial era]], Hercules was worshipped locally from [[Hispania]] through [[Gaul]].

===Germanic association===
[[File:I08 274 Augustalenkolleg, Herkulesmotiv.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A fresco from [[Herculaneum]] depicting [[Heracles]] and [[Achelous]] from [[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology]], 1st century CE.]]

[[Tacitus]] records a special affinity of the [[Germanic peoples]] for Hercules. In chapter 3 of his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Tacitus states:

{{bquote|... they say that Hercules, too, once visited them; and when going into battle, they sang of him first of all heroes.  They have also those songs of theirs, by the recital of this ''barditus''&lt;ref&gt;or, ''baritus'', there being scribal variants. In the 17th century, the word entered the German language as ''barditus'' and was associated with the Celtic [[bard]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; as they call it, they rouse their courage, while from the note they augur the result of the approaching conflict. For, as their line shouts, they inspire or feel alarm.}}

Some have taken this as Tacitus equating the Germanic ''[[Thor|Þunraz]]'' with Hercules by way of ''interpretatio romana''.&lt;ref&gt;Simek, Rudolf (2007:140–142) translated by Angela Hall. ''Dictionary of Northern Mythology''.  D.S. Brewer. {{ISBN|0-85991-513-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Roman era [[Hercules' Club (amulet)|Hercules' Club]] amulets appear from the 2nd to 3rd century, distributed over the empire (including [[Roman Britain]], c.f. Cool 1986), mostly made of gold, shaped like wooden clubs. A specimen found in [[Köln-Nippes]] bears the inscription &lt;small&gt;"DEO HER&lt;/small&gt;[culi]", confirming the association with Hercules.

In the 5th to 7th centuries, during the [[Migration Period]], the amulet is theorized to have rapidly spread from the [[Elbe Germanic]] area across Europe. These Germanic "[[Thor|Donar's Clubs]]" were made from deer antler, bone or wood, more rarely also from bronze or precious metals. The amulet type is replaced by the [[Viking Age]] [[Mjölnir|Thor's hammer]] pendants in the course of the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]] from the 8th to 9th century.

==Medieval mythography==
[[File:Histoires de Troyes - Nemeian Lion.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hercules and the [[Nemean lion]] in the 15th-century ''[[Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye|Histoires de Troyes]]'']]

After the Roman Empire became [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christianized]], mythological narratives were often reinterpreted as [[allegory]], influenced by the philosophy of [[late antiquity]]. In the 4th century, [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] had described Hercules' return from the underworld as representing his ability to overcome earthly desires and vices, or the earth itself as a consumer of bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+A.+6.395&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053 6.395] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801183425/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+A.+6.395&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053 |date=2020-08-01 }}; Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433–1177'' (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval mythography, Hercules was one of the heroes seen as a strong role model who demonstrated both valor and wisdom, while the monsters he battles were regarded as moral obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', pp. 168, 218, 413.&lt;/ref&gt; One [[glossator]] noted that when [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules became a constellation]], he showed that strength was necessary to gain entrance to Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval mythography was written almost entirely in Latin, and original Greek texts were little used as sources for Hercules' myths.

==Renaissance mythography==
[[File:Henry IV en Herculeus terrassant l Hydre de Lerne cad La ligue Catholique Atelier Toussaint Dubreuil circa 1600.jpg|thumb|right|King [[Henry IV of France]] depicted as Hercules vanquishing the [[Lernaean Hydra]] (i.e. the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]), by [[Toussaint Dubreuil]], {{circa|1600}}]]

The [[Renaissance]] and the invention of the [[printing press]] brought a renewed interest in and publication of Greek literature. Renaissance mythography drew more extensively on the Greek tradition of Heracles, typically under the Romanized name Hercules, or the alternate name [[Heracles|Alcides]]. In a chapter of his book ''Mythologiae'' (1567), the influential mythographer [[Natale Conti]] collected and summarized an extensive range of myths concerning the birth, adventures, and death of the hero under his Roman name Hercules. Conti begins his lengthy chapter on Hercules with an overview description that continues the moralizing impulse of the Middle Ages:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

Hercules, who subdued and destroyed monsters, bandits, and criminals, was justly famous and renowned for his great courage. His great and glorious reputation was worldwide, and so firmly entrenched that he'll always be remembered. In fact the ancients honored him with his own temples, altars, ceremonies, and priests. But it was his wisdom and great soul that earned those honors; noble blood, physical strength, and political power just aren't good enough.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natale Conti]], ''Mythologiae'' Book 7, Chapter 1, as translated by John Mulryan and Steven Brown (Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2006), vol. 2, p. 566.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1600, the citizens of [[Avignon]] bestowed on [[Henry of Navarre]] (the future King [[Henry IV of France]]) the title of the ''Hercule Gaulois'' ("Gallic Hercules"), justifying the extravagant flattery with a genealogy that traced the origin of the House of Navarre to a nephew of Hercules' son Hispalus.&lt;ref&gt;The official account, ''Labyrinthe royal...'' quoted in [[Jean Seznec]], ''The Survival of the Pagan Gods'', (B.F. Sessions, tr., 1995) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Worship ==
=== Road of Hercules ===

The Road of Hercules is a route across Southern Gaul that is associated with the path Hercules took during his 10th labor of retrieving the Cattle of Geryon from the Red Isles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dewitt|first=Norman|date=February 22, 2020|title=Rome and the 'Road of Hercules'|journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association|volume=72|pages=59–69|doi=10.2307/283041|jstor=283041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannibal took the same path on his march towards Italy and encouraged the belief that he was the second Hercules.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Primary sources often make comparisons between Hercules and Hannibal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hannibal further tried to invoke parallels between himself and Hercules by starting his march on Italy by visiting the shrine of Hercules at Gades. While crossing the alps, he performed labors in a heroic manner.  A famous example was noted by Livy, when Hannibal fractured the side of a cliff that was blocking his march.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Worship from women ===

In ancient Roman society women were usually limited to two types of cults: those that addressed feminine matters such as childbirth, and cults that required virginal chastity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schultz|first=Cecelia|date=February 22, 2020|title=Modern Prejudice and Ancient Praxis: Female Worship of Hercules at Rome|journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik|volume=133|pages=291–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is evidence suggesting there were female worshippers of Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and Hercules.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some scholars believe that women were completely prohibited from any of Hercules's cults. Others believe it was only the "Ara Maxima" at which they were not allowed to worship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Macrobius]] in his first book of ''Saturnalia'' paraphrases from Varro: "For when Hercules was bringing the cattle of Geryon through Italy, a woman replied to the thirsty hero that she could not give him water because it was the day of the Goddess Women and it was unlawful for a man to taste what had been prepared for her. Hercules, therefore, when he was about to offer a sacrifice forbid the presence of women and ordered Potitius and Pinarius who were in charge of his rites, not to allow any women from taking part".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Macrobius states that women were restricted in their participation in Hercules cults, but to what extent remains ambiguous. He mentions that women were not allowed to participate in Sacrum which is general term used to describe anything that was believed to have belonged to the gods. This could include anything from a precious item to a temple. Due to the general nature of a Sacrum, we can not judge the extent of the prohibition from Macrobius alone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There are also ancient writings on this topic from Aulus Gellius when speaking on how Romans swore oaths. He mentioned that Roman women do not swear on Hercules, nor do Roman men swear on Castor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He went on to say that women refrain from sacrificing to Hercules.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Propertius in his poem 4.9 also mentions similar information as Macrobius. This is evidence that he was also using Varro as a source.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Worship in myth ===

There is evidence of Hercules worship in myth in the Latin epic poem, the ''[[Aeneid]]''. In the 8th book of the poem [[Aeneas]] finally reaches the future site of Rome, where he meets [[Evander of Pallantium|Evander]] and the Arcadians making sacrifices to Hercules on the banks of the Tiber river.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loar|first=Matthew|date=February 23, 2020|title=Hercules, Mummius, and the Roman Triumph in Aeneid 8|journal=Classical Philology |volume=112|pages=45–62|doi=10.1086/689726|s2cid=164402027|url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1139&amp;context=classicsfacpub}}&lt;/ref&gt; They share a feast, and Evander tells the story of how Hercules defeated the monster Cascus, and describes him as a triumphant hero.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Translated from the Latin text of Vergil, Evander stated: "Time brought to us in our time of need the aid and arrival of a god. For there came that mightiest avenger, the victor Hercules, proud with the slaughter and the spoils of threefold Geryon, and he drove the mighty bulls here, and the cattle filled both valley and riverside.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Hercules was also mentioned in the Fables of [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]]. For example, in his fable about [[Philoctetes]] he tells the story of how Philoctetes built a funeral pyre for Hercules so his body could be consumed and raised to immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae3.html|title=Hyginus, Fabulae, 100–49|last=Grant|first=Mary|website=Theoi Texts Library|access-date=March 7, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hercules and the Roman triumph===

According to Livy (9.44.16) Romans were commemorating military victories by building statues to Hercules as early as 305 BCE. Also, philosopher [[Pliny the Elder]] dates Hercules worship back to the time of Evander, by accrediting him with erecting a statue in the Forum Boarium of Hercules.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loar|first=Matthew|date=February 23, 2020|title=Hercules, Mummius, and the Roman Triumph in Aeneid 8|journal=Classical Philology|volume=112|pages=45–62|doi=10.1086/689726|s2cid=164402027|url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1139&amp;context=classicsfacpub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars agree that there would have been 5–7 temples in Augustan Rome.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; There are believed to be related Republican ''triumphatores,'' however, not necessarily triumphal dedications. There is two temples located in the Campus Martius. One, being the Temple of Hercules Musarum, dedicated between 187 and 179 BCE by M. Fulvius Nobilior.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; And the other being the Temple of Hercules Custos, likely renovated by Sulla in the 80s BCE.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

===In art===
In Roman works of art and in Renaissance and post-Renaissance art, Hercules can be identified by his attributes, the [[Nemean Lion|lion skin]] and the gnarled [[Club (weapon)|club]] (his favorite weapon); in [[mosaic]] he is shown tanned bronze, a virile aspect.&lt;ref&gt;''Hercules'' almost suggests "Hero". The Classical and Hellenistic convention in frescoes and mosaics, adopted by the Romans, is to show women as pale-skinned and men as tanned dark from their outdoor arena of action and exercising in the [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]].(See also [http://academic.reed.edu/humanities/110Tech/RomanAfrica2/pompei%26herc1.jpg Reed.edu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506182021/http://academic.reed.edu/humanities/110Tech/RomanAfrica2/pompei%26herc1.jpg |date=2006-05-06 }}, jpg file.

In the twentieth century, the ''[[Farnese Hercules]]'' has inspired artists such as [[Jeff Koons]], [[Matthew Darbyshire]] and [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] to reinterpret Hercules for new audiences.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hinds|first=Aimee|title=Hercules in White: Classical Reception, Art and Myth|url=https://www.thejugaadproject.pub/home/hercules-in-white-classical-reception-art-and-myth|access-date=2020-10-22|website=The Jugaad Project|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of deliberately white materials by Koons and Darbyshire has been interpreted as perpetuation of colourism in how the classical world is viewed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Mapplethorpe's work with black model Derrick Cross can be seen as a reaction to Neo-classical colourism, resisting the portrayal of Hercules as white.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===In numismatics===
Hercules was among the earliest figures on ancient Roman coinage, and has been the main motif of many collector coins and medals since. One example is the Austrian [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2002 coinage|20 euro Baroque Silver coin]] issued on September 11, 2002. The obverse side of the coin shows the Grand Staircase in the town palace of [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] in [[Vienna]], currently the Austrian Ministry of Finance. Gods and [[demi-gods]] hold its flights, while Hercules stands at the turn of the stairs.

===Military===
{{for|ships named Hercules|Hercules (ship)}}
Six successive ships of the British [[Royal Navy]], from the 18th to the 20th century, bore the name [[HMS Hercules|HMS ''Hercules'']].

In the [[French Navy]], there were no less than nineteen ships called ''[[French ship Hercule |Hercule]]'', plus three more named ''[[HMS Alcide|Alcide]]'' which is another name of the same hero.

Hercules' name was also used for five ships of the [[US Navy]], four ships of the [[Spanish Navy]], four of the [[Argentine Navy]] and two of the [[Swedish Navy]], as well as for numerous civilian sailing and steam ships.

In modern aviation a [[military transport aircraft]] produced by [[Lockheed Martin]] carries the title [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]].

[[Operation Herkules]] was the German code-name given to an abortive plan for the invasion of [[Malta]] during the  [[Second World War]].

===In films===
{{For|a list of films featuring Hercules|Hercules in popular culture#Filmography}}
A series of nineteen Italian Hercules movies were made in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The actors who played Hercules in these films were [[Steve Reeves]], [[Gordon Scott]], Kirk Morris, [[Mickey Hargitay]], Mark Forest, Alan Steel, [[Dan Vadis]], [[Brad Harris]], [[Reg Park]], [[Peter Lupus]] (billed as [[Rock Stevens]]) and Michael Lane.

[[File:Restout - Morpheus.jpg|thumb|''Morpheus'', painted by [[Jean-Bernard Restout]]]]

'''Morpheus'''  ('Fashioner', derived from the {{lang-grc|μορφή}} meaning 'form, shape')&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 249; Grimal, s.v. Morpheus, p. 296; ''[[LSJ]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmorfh%2F s.v. μορφ-ή].&lt;/ref&gt; is a god associated with [[sleep]] and [[dream]]s. In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' he is the son of [[Somnus]] and appears in dreams in human form. From the [[Middle Ages]], the name began to stand more generally for the god of dreams, or of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Kearns, s.v. Morpheus p. 968; Griffin, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ovid==
In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', Morpheus is one of the thousand sons of [[Somnus]] (Sleep).&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, s.v. Morpheus, p. 296; Tripp, s.v. Somnus, p. 534; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.633&amp;ndash;677].&lt;/ref&gt; His name derives from the Greek word for form (μορφή), and his function was to appear in dreams in human guise.  According to Ovid "no other is more skilled than he in representing the gait, the features, and the speech of men; the clothing also and the accustomed words of each he represents."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.633&amp;ndash;638].&lt;/ref&gt; Like other gods associated with sleep, Ovid makes Morpheus winged.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, s.v. Morpheus, p. 296; Griffin, p. 243; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.167.xml 11.652&amp;ndash;653].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ovid called Morpheus and his brothers, the other sons of Somnus, the ''Somnia'' ("dream shapes"), saying that they appear in dreams "mimicking many forms".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.163.xml 11.613].&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid gives names to two more of these sons of Sleep. One called Icelos ('Like'), by the gods, but [[Phobetor]] ('Frightener') by men, "takes the form of beast or bird or the long serpent", and [[Phantasos]] ('Fantasy'), who "puts on deceptive shapes of earth, rocks, water, trees, all lifeless things".&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 249; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.638&amp;ndash;643].&lt;/ref&gt;

The three brothers' names are found nowhere earlier than Ovid, and are perhaps Ovidian inventions.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Tripp calls these three figures "literary, not mythical concepts".&lt;ref&gt;Tripp, s.v. Somnus, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Griffin suggests that this division of dream forms between Morpheus and his brothers, possibly including their names, may have been of Hellenistic origin.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, pp. 179, 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucifer'''{{efn|''Lucifer'' is the Latin name for the planet [[Venus]] in its morning appearances. It corresponds to the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] names {{lang|grc|Φωσφόρος}}, "light-bringer", and {{lang|grc|Ἑωσφόρος}}, "dawn-bringer".}} is one of various figures in [[folklore]] associated with the planet [[Venus]]. The entity's name was subsequently absorbed into [[Christianity]] as a name for [[Devil in Christianity|the devil]]. Modern scholarship generally translates the term in the relevant [[Bible]] passage ([[Isaiah 14:12]]), where the Greek Septuagint reads ὁ ἑωσφόρος ὁ πρωὶ, as "morning star" or "shining one" rather than as a proper noun, Lucifer, as found in the Latin [[Vulgate]].

As a name for the [[Devil]] in [[Christian theology]], the more common meaning in English, "Lucifer" is the rendering of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word {{lang-he|הֵילֵל|hêlēl|label=none}}, (pronunciation: ''hay-lale'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.studylight.org/lexicons/hebrew/1966.html Old Testament Hebrew Lexical Dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Isaiah 14|Isaiah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Isaiah|14:12|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; given in the [[King James Version]] of the Bible. The translators of this version took the word from the Latin Vulgate,&lt;ref name="Kohler1923"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohler |first=Kaufmann |title=Heaven and Hell in Comparative Religion with Special Reference to Dante's Divine Comedy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xIaQYpGrmdIC&amp;q=vulgate&amp;pg=PA5 |date=2006 |isbn=0-7661-6608-2 |pages=4–5 |publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]] |location=Whitefish, Montana |quote=Lucifer, is taken from the Latin version, the Vulgate}} Originally published New York: The MacMillan Co., 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; which translated {{lang|he|הֵילֵל}} by the Latin word {{lang |la |lucifer}} (uncapitalized),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drbo.org/lvb/chapter/27014.htm |title=Latin Vulgate Bible: Isaiah 14 |publisher=DRBO.org |access-date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vulgate Latin: Isaiah Chapter 14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/vul/isa014.htm#012 |title=Vulgate: Isaiah Chapter 14 |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |access-date=22 December 2012 |language=la}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "the morning star", "the planet Venus", or, as an adjective, "light-bringing".&lt;ref name="Lewis&amp;S"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dlucifer |first1=Charlton T. |last1=Lewis |first2=Charles |last2=Short |title=A Latin Dictionary |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |access-date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a name for the planet in its morning aspect, "Lucifer" (Light-Bringer) is a [[proper noun]] and is capitalized in English. In [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman civilization]], it was often [[personification|personified]] and considered a [[deity|god]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofgr0000dixo |url-access=registration |quote=dixon-kennedy lucifer. |first=Mike |last=Dixon-Kennedy |title=Encyclopedia of Greco-Roman Mythology |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |location=Santa Barbara, California |date=1998 |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofgr0000dixo/page/193 193] |isbn=978-1-57607-094-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some versions considered a son of [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]] (the Dawn).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fZUOAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Smith+Classical+Dictionary+Lucifer&amp;pg=PA235 |first=William |last=Smith |title=A Smaller Classical Dictionary of Biography, Mythology, and Geography |chapter=Lucifer |publisher=Harper |location=New York City |date=1878 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar name used by the Roman poet [[Catullus]] for the planet in its evening aspect is "Noctifer" (Night-Bringer).&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Catullus_62 Catullus 62.8].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman folklore and etymology==

In [[Roman folklore]], Lucifer ("light-bringer" in Latin) was the name of the planet Venus, though it was often [[Personification|personified]] as a male figure bearing a torch. The Greek name for this planet was variously [[Phosphoros]] (also meaning "light-bringer") or [[Heosphoros]] (meaning "dawn-bringer").&lt;ref name="EBLCM"&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lucifer-classical-mythology "Lucifer]" in ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''].&lt;/ref&gt; Lucifer was said to be "the fabled son of [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]]&lt;ref name="Auffarth"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first=Christoph | editor1-last=Auffarth | editor1-link=Christoph Auffarth  | editor2-first=Loren T. | editor2-last=Stuckenbruck | editor2-link=Loren T.

He was often presented in poetry as heralding the dawn.&lt;ref name="EBLCM" /&gt;[[File:Mercury, Venus and the Moon Align.jpg|thumb|Planet Venus in alignment with Mercury (''above'') and the Moon (''below'')]]The Latin word corresponding to Greek {{transliteration|grc|Phosphoros}} is {{lang |la |Lucifer}}.

Lucifer's mother Aurora is cognate to the [[Vedic]] goddess [[Ushas]], [[Culture of Lithuania|Lithuania]]n goddess [[Aušrinė]], and Greek [[Eos]], all three of whom are also goddesses of the dawn. All four are considered derivatives of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] stem ''{{PIE|*h₂ewsṓs}}''&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 492.&lt;/ref&gt; (later ''{{PIE|*Ausṓs}}''), "dawn", a stem that also gave rise to [[Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|*Austrō}}, [[Old Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|*Ōstara}} and [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|[[Ēostre]]/Ēastre}}. This agreement leads to the reconstruction of a [[Hausos|Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mallory |first1=J. P. |last2=Adams |first2=D. Q. |title=The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordintroducti00mall |url-access=limited |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-929668-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordintroducti00mall/page/n456 432]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the [[Sanskrit]]/[[Hindi]]/[[Malayalam]] word Ushas (dawn) is the root of the German word "Ost" and its English equivalent "East". It should also be noted that "Austria" (Österreich in German) means "Eastern Kingdom".

The 2nd-century Roman mythographer [[De Astronomica|Pseudo-Hyginus]] said of the planet:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Titan/AstraPlaneta.html Astronomica 2. 4 (trans. Grant)].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|The fourth star is that of Venus, Luciferus by name. Some say it is Juno's. In many tales it is recorded that it is called Hesperus, too. It seems to be the largest of all stars. Some have said it represents the son of Aurora and Cephalus, who surpassed many in beauty, so that he even vied with Venus, and, as Eratosthenes says, for this reason it is called the star of Venus. It is visible both at dawn and sunset, and so properly has been called both Luciferus and Hesperus.}}

The Latin poet [[Ovid]], in his 1st-century epic {{lang |la |[[Metamorphoses]]}}, describes Lucifer as ordering the heavens:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Titan/AstraPlaneta.html Metamorphoses 2. 112 ff (trans. Melville)].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Aurora, watchful in the reddening dawn, threw wide her crimson doors and rose-filled halls; the Stellae took flight, in marshaled order set by Lucifer who left his station last.}}

Ovid, speaking of Phosphorus and [[Hesperus]] (the Evening Star, the evening appearance of the planet Venus) as identical, makes him the father of [[Daedalion]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Metamorphoses]]'', 11:295.&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid also makes him the father of [[Ceyx]],&lt;ref&gt;''Metamorphoses'', 11:271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]]. [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.7.4&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022:book=1:chapter=7&amp;highlight=Lucifer ''Bibliotheca'', 1.7.4].&lt;/ref&gt; while the Latin grammarian [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] makes him the father of the [[Hesperides]] or of [[Hesperis (mythology)|Hesperis]].&lt;ref name="TGM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Titan/AsterEosphoros.html |title=EOSPHORUS &amp; HESPERUS (Eosphoros &amp; Hesperos) – Greek Gods of the Morning &amp; Evening Stars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the classical Roman period, Lucifer was not typically regarded as a deity and had few, if any, myths,&lt;ref name=EBLCM/&gt; though the planet was associated with various deities and often poetically personified. [[Cicero]] stated that "You say that Sol the Sun and Luna the Moon are deities, and the Greeks identify the former with Apollo and the latter with Diana. But if Luna (the Moon) is a goddess, then Lucifer (the Morning-Star) also and the rest of the Wandering Stars ({{lang |la |Stellae Errantes}}) will have to be counted gods; and if so, then the Fixed Stars ({{lang |la |Stellae Inerrantes}}) as well."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Titan/AstraPlaneta.html Cicero, De Natura Deorum 3. 19].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planet Venus, Sumerian folklore, and fall from heaven motif ==
{{main|Venus in culture#Canaanite mythology}}
The [[Motif-Index of Folk-Literature#Terminology|motif]] of a heavenly being striving for the highest seat of heaven only to be cast down to the underworld has its origins in the motions of the planet [[Venus]], known as the morning star.

The [[Sumer]]ian goddess [[Inanna]] ([[Babylonia]]n Ishtar) is associated with the planet Venus, and Inanna's actions in several of her myths, including ''[[Inanna and Shukaletuda]]'' and ''[[Inanna#Descent into the underworld|Inanna's Descent into the Underworld]]'' appear to parallel the motion of Venus as it progresses through its [[synodic cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BdSzj9-SZv0C&amp;q=%22identified+with+the+morning+star%22&amp;pg=PA238 |author1=Marvin Alan Sweeney |title=Isaiah 1–39 |isbn=978-0-8028-4100-1 |page=238 |publisher=Eerdmans |date=1996 |access-date=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooley"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cooley |first=Jeffrey L. |title=Inana and Šukaletuda: A Sumerian Astral Myth |url=https://www.academia.edu/1247599 |journal=KASKAL |volume=5 |pages=161–172 |year=2008 |issn=1971-8608}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Black |first1=Jeremy |first2=Anthony |last2=Green |title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05LXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Inana |publisher=The British Museum Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-7141-1705-6 |pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nemet-Nejat |first=Karen Rhea |author-link=Karen Rhea Nemet-Nejat |date=1998 |title=Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location=Santa Barbara, California |isbn=978-0-313-29497-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinancie00neme/page/203 203] |url=https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinancie00neme/page/203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar theme is present in the [[Babylonia]]n myth of [[Etana]]. The ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' comments:
{{blockquote|The brilliancy of the morning star, which eclipses all other stars, but is not seen during the night, may easily have given rise to a myth such as was told of Ethana and [[Zu (mythology)|Zu]]: he was led by his pride to strive for the highest seat among the star-gods on the northern mountain of the gods [...] but was hurled down by the supreme ruler of the Babylonian Olympus.&lt;ref name="Jewish"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10177-lucifer |title=Lucifer |encyclopedia=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] |access-date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The fall from heaven motif also has a parallel in [[Canaanite mythology]]. In ancient Canaanite religion, the morning star is personified as the god [[Attar (god)|Attar]], who attempted to occupy the throne of [[Baal|Ba'al]] and, finding he was unable to do so, descended and ruled the [[underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-gfwlltlRwC|first=John|last=Day|title=Yahweh and the gods and goddesses of Canaan|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|location=London|date=2002|isbn=978-0-8264-6830-7|pages=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hj791_BeAF0C|first=Gregory A.|last=Boyd|title=God at War: The Bible &amp; Spiritual Conflict|publisher=InterVarsity Press|date=1997|isbn=978-0-8308-1885-3|pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original myth may have been about the lesser god Helel trying to dethrone the Canaanite high god [[El (deity)|El]], who lived on a mountain to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ns4UAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Pope+%22El+in+the+Ugaritic+texts%22 |title=Marvin H.

It argues that the closest parallels with Isaiah's description of the king of Babylon as a fallen morning star cast down from heaven are to be found not in Canaanite myths, but in traditional ideas of the Jewish people, echoed in the Biblical account of the fall of [[Adam and Eve]], cast out of God's presence for wishing to be as God, and the picture in [[Psalm 82]] of the "gods" and "sons of the Most High" destined to die and fall.&lt;ref name="Eerdmans"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Vo-11umIZQC&amp;q=%22any+Canaanite+myth%22&amp;pg=PA511 |first1=James D.

In the [[Book of Isaiah]], [[Isaiah 14|chapter 14]], the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|king of Babylon]] is condemned in a [[Prophecy|prophetic vision]] by the prophet [[Isaiah]] and is called {{lang|he|הֵילֵל&amp;nbsp;בֶּן-שָׁחַר}} ({{transliteration|he|Helel ben [[Shahar (god)|Shachar]]}}, [[Hebrew]] for "shining one, son of the morning"),&lt;ref name="Eerdmans" /&gt; who is addressed as {{lang|he|הילל בן שחר}} ({{transliteration|he|Hêlêl ben Šāḥar}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interlinearbible.org/isaiah/14-12.htm |title=Isaiah 14 Biblos Interlinear Bible |publisher=Interlinearbible.org |access-date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wlc.hebrewtanakh.com/isaiah/14.htm |title=Isaiah 14 Hebrew OT: Westminster Leningrad Codex |publisher=Wlc.hebrewtanakh.com |access-date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Astronomy – Helel, Son of the Morning|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2052-astronomy|encyclopedia=Jewish Encyclopedia|edition=1906|access-date=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilken|first=Robert|title=Isaiah: Interpreted by Early Christian and Medieval Commentators|date=2007|publisher=Wm Eerdmans Publishing|location=Grand Rapids MI|isbn=978-0-8028-2581-0|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title {{transliteration|he|"Hêlêl ben Šāḥar"}} refers to the planet [[Venus]] as the morning star, and that is how the Hebrew word is usually interpreted.&lt;ref name="MM-Isa14"&gt;{{cite web|title=Isaiah Chapter 14|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1014.htm|website=mechon-mamre.org|publisher=The Mamre Institute|access-date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gunkel expressly states that "the name Helel ben Shahar clearly states that it is a question of a nature myth.

(In spite of the unanimous testimony of published texts of the Septuagint, [[Kaufmann Kohler]] says that the Greek Septuagint translation is "[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphoros]]".)&lt;ref name=Kohler1923/&gt; --&gt; Similarly the [[Vulgate]] renders {{lang|he|הֵילֵל}} in [[Latin]] as {{lang |la |Lucifer}}, the name in that language for the morning star. According to the [[King James Bible]]-based [[Strong's Concordance]], the original Hebrew word means "shining one, light-bearer", and the English translation given in the King James text is the Latin name for the planet Venus, "Lucifer",&lt;ref name="H1966" /&gt; as it was already in the [[Wycliffe Bible]].

However, the translation of {{lang|he|הֵילֵל}} as "Lucifer" has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. Present-day translations render {{lang|he|הֵילֵל}} as "morning star" ([[New International Version]], [[New Century Version]], [[New American Standard Bible]], [[Good News Bible|Good News Translation]], [[Holman Christian Standard Bible]], [[Contemporary English Version]], [[Common English Bible]], [[Messianic Bible translations|Complete Jewish Bible]]), "daystar" ([[New Jerusalem Bible]], [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]]), "Day Star" ([[New Revised Standard Version]], [[English Standard Version]]), "shining one" ([[New Life Version]], [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|New World Translation]], [[JPS Tanakh]]), or "shining star" ([[New Living Translation]]).

In a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase "Lucifer" or "morning star" occurs begins with the statement: "On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Isaiah|14:3–4|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues:

{{blockquote|How you have fallen from heaven, ''morning star'', son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, "I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of [[Mount Aqraa|Mount Zaphon]]. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High." But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit. Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: "Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Isaiah|14:12–17|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== As the devil ===

The [[metaphor]] of the morning star that Isaiah 14:12 applied to a king of Babylon gave rise to the general use of the Latin word for "morning star", capitalized, as the original name of the devil before his fall from grace, linking Isaiah 14:12 with [[Luke 10]] ("I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven")&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Luke|10:18|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and interpreting the passage in Isaiah as an allegory of Satan's fall from heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/merriamwebsterne00merr |url-access=registration |quote=name Lucifer was born -magazine. |title=The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories |isbn=978-0-87779-603-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/merriamwebsterne00merr/page/280 280] |publisher=Merriam-Webster |date=1991 |access-date=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X5-pmLBcw44C&amp;q=%22the+name+Lucifer+was+given%22&amp;pg=PA57 |author=Harold Bloom |title=Satan |publisher=Infobase Publishing |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-7910-8386-4 |page=57 |access-date=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering [[pride]] as a [[seven deadly sins|major sin]] peaking in self-[[deification]], Lucifer ({{transliteration|he|Hêlêl}}) became the template for the devil.&lt;ref&gt;Litwa, M. David (2016). Desiring Divinity: Self-deification in Early Jewish and Christian Mythmaking. Oxford University Press. ISBN 978-0-19-046717-3. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Lucifer was identified with the devil in Christianity and in Christian popular literature,&lt;ref name=Kohler1923/&gt; as in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', [[Joost van den Vondel]]'s ''Lucifer'', and [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.&lt;ref name="Adelman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adelman|first=Rachel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7Ue5kAkw20C|title=The Return of the Repressed: Pirqe De-Rabbi Eliezer and the Pseudepigrapha|date=2009|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|BRILL]]|isbn=978-90-04-17049-0|location=[[Leiden]]|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7Ue5kAkw20C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=heosphoros+%22Dante+and+Milton%22 67]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early medieval Christianity fairly distinguished between Lucifer and Satan.

[[Aquila of Sinope]] derives the word {{transliteration|he|hêlêl}}, the Hebrew name for the morning star, from the verb {{transliteration|he|yalal}} (to lament). This derivation was adopted as a proper name for an angel who laments the loss of his former beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnetain, Yvonne S (2015).

The equation of Lucifer with the fallen angel probably occurred in 1st century Palestinian Judaism. The church fathers brought the fallen lightbringer Lucifer into connection with the Devil on the basis of a saying of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke (10.18 EU): "I saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning."&lt;ref&gt;Theißen, Gerd (2009).

Some Christian writers have applied the name "Lucifer" as used in the Book of Isaiah, and the motif of a heavenly being cast down to the earth, to the devil. Sigve K. Tonstad argues that the [[New Testament]] [[War in Heaven]] theme of [[Revelation 12]], in which the dragon "who is called the devil and Satan [...] was thrown down to the earth", was derived from the passage about the Babylonian king in Isaiah 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YYNJxKrhcDAC&amp;q=Tonstad+%22derives+from+the+poem%22&amp;pg=PA75 |author1=Sigve K Tonstad |title=Saving God's Reputation |isbn=978-0-567-04494-5 |page=75 |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]] |location=London, New York City |date=20 January 2007 |access-date=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Origen]] (184/185–253/254) interpreted such Old Testament passages as being about manifestations of the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C |title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition |first=Joseph Francis |last=Kelly |publisher=[[Liturgical Press]] |location=[[Collegeville Township, Stearns County, Minnesota|Collegeville, Minnesota]] |date=2002 |page=[https://archive.org/details/problemofevilint00jose/page/44 &lt;!-- quote="Origen's approach had an unintended side effect, a new name for the devil""allegorized it as Satan falling from heaven.

[[Augustine of Hippo]]'s work {{lang |la |[[Civitas Dei]]}} (5th century) became the major opinion of Western demonology including in the [[Catholic Church]]. For Augustine, the rebellion of the devil was the first and final cause of evil. By this he rejected some earlier teachings about Satan having fallen when the world was already created.&lt;ref&gt;Schreckenberg, Heinz; Schubert, Kurt (1992).

The 1409 [[Lollard]] manuscript titled ''[[Great Architect of the Universe#Lanterne of Light classification of demons|Lanterne of Light]]'' associated Lucifer with the [[Seven deadly sins|deadly sin]] of the [[pride#sin and self-acceptance|pride]].

[[Protestantism|Protestant]] theologian [[John Calvin]] rejected the identification of Lucifer with Satan or the devil. He said: "The exposition of this passage, which some have given, as if it referred to Satan, has arisen from ignorance: for the context plainly shows these statements must be understood in reference to the king of the Babylonians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Calvin |first=John |others=Translated by John King |title=Commentary on Isaiah |volume=I:404 |date=2007 |publisher=Forgotten Books |location=Charleston, S.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] also considered it a gross error to refer this verse to the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ridderbos |first=Jan |others=Translated by John Vriend |title=The Bible Student's Commentary: Isaiah |page=142 |date=1985 |publisher=Regency |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counter-Reformation writers, like [[Albertanus of Brescia]], classified the seven deadly sins each to a specific Biblical demon.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Gilli (ed.). ''La pathologie du pouvoir: vices, crimes et délits des gouvernants: antiquité, moyen âge, époque moderne'' (2016). Studies in Medieval and Reformation Traditions, vol. 198. Brill. pg. 494&lt;/ref&gt; He, as well as [[Peter Binsfield]], assigned Lucifer to the sin ''pride''.&lt;ref&gt;Levack, B. (2013). ''The Devil Within: Possession and Exorcism in the Christian West''. Yale University Press. pg. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gnosticism ====
Since Lucifer's sin mainly consists of self-deification, some [[Gnostic]] sects identified Lucifer with the [[creator deity]] in the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;Litwa, M. David (2016). ''Desiring Divinity: Self-deification in Early Jewish and Christian Mythmaking''.

Jesus descended to earth to free the captured souls.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Thomsett (2011). ''Heresy in the Roman Catholic Church: A History''.

Shambhala. {{ISBN|978-0-834-82414-0}}. p. 745–755, 831&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to mainstream Christianity, the [[Christian cross|cross]] was denounced as a symbol of Lucifer and his instrument in an attempt to kill Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer (2009).

==== Latter Day Saint movement ====
Lucifer is regarded within the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] as the [[Mormon cosmology#Pre-mortality|pre-mortal]] name of the devil. [[Mormon theology]] teaches that in a [[Mormon cosmology#Council in Heaven|heavenly council]], Lucifer rebelled against the plan of [[God in Mormonism|God the Father]] and was subsequently cast out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Lucifer|title=Devils |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Mormonism}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Doctrine and Covenants]] reads:
{{blockquote|And this we saw also, and bear record, that an angel of God who was in authority in the presence of God, who rebelled against the Only Begotten Son whom the Father loved and who was in the bosom of the Father, was thrust down from the presence of God and the Son, and was called Perdition, for the heavens wept over him—he was Lucifer, a son of the morning. And we beheld, and lo, he is fallen! is fallen, even a son of the morning! And while we were yet in the Spirit, the Lord commanded us that we should write the vision; for we beheld Satan, that old serpent, even the devil, who rebelled against God, and sought to take the kingdom of our God and his Christ—Wherefore, he maketh war with the saints of God, and encompasseth them round about.|Doctrine and Covenants 76:25–29&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.25-29?lang=eng#p24|title=D&amp;C 76:25–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After becoming Satan by his fall, Lucifer "goeth up and down, to and fro in the earth, seeking to destroy the souls of men".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.27?lang=eng|title=D&amp;C 10:27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] consider Isaiah 14:12 to be referring to both the king of the Babylonians and the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/gs/lucifer?lang=eng|title=Lucifer |website=churchofjesuschrist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/ot/isa/14.12?lang=eng|title=Isaiah 14:12, footnote c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other occurrences==
===Anthroposophy===
[[Rudolf Steiner]]'s writings, which formed the basis for [[Anthroposophy]], characterised Lucifer as a spiritual opposite to [[Ahriman]], with [[Christ]] between the two forces, mediating a balanced path for humanity. Lucifer represents an intellectual, imaginative, delusional, otherworldly force which might be associated with visions, subjectivity, psychosis and fantasy. He associated Lucifer with the religious/philosophical cultures of Egypt, Rome and Greece. Steiner believed that Lucifer, as a supersensible Being, had incarnated in China about 3000 years before the birth of Christ.

===Luciferianism===
[[Luciferianism]] is a belief structure that venerates the fundamental traits that are attributed to Lucifer. The custom, inspired by the teachings of [[Gnosticism]], usually reveres Lucifer not as the devil, but as a savior, a guardian or instructing spirit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vampires in Their Own Words: An Anthology of Vampire Voices |author=Michelle Belanger |publisher=[[Llewellyn Worldwide]] |date=2007 |page=175 |isbn=978-0-7387-1220-8|author-link=Michelle Belanger}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even the true god as opposed to [[Jehovah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of Occultism |author=Spence, L. |publisher=Carol Publishing |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Anton LaVey]]'s ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'', Lucifer is one of the [[The Book of Abramelin|four crown princes of hell]], particularly that of the East, the 'lord of the [[Air (classical element)|air]]', and is called the bringer of light, the morning star, intellectualism, and enlightenment.&lt;ref name="LaVey"&gt;{{cite book|last=LaVey|first=Anton Szandor|title=The Satanic Bible|date=1969|publisher=Avon|location=New York|isbn=978-0-380-01539-9|chapter=The Book of Lucifer: The Enlightenment|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/satanicbible00lave|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/satanicbible00lave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freemasonry===
[[Léo Taxil]] (1854–1907) claimed that [[Freemasonry]] is associated with worshipping Lucifer. In what is known as the [[Taxil hoax]], he alleged that leading Freemason [[Albert Pike]] had addressed "The 23 Supreme Confederated Councils of the world" (an invention of Taxil), instructing them that Lucifer was God, and was in opposition to the evil god [[Adonai]].  Taxil promoted a book by Diana Vaughan (actually written by himself, as he later confessed publicly)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/taxil_confessed.html |title=Leo Taxil's confession |publisher=Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon |date=2 April 2001 |access-date=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that purported to reveal a highly secret ruling body called the [[Palladists|Palladium]], which controlled the organization and had a satanic agenda. As described by ''Freemasonry Disclosed'' in 1897:
{{blockquote|With frightening cynicism, the miserable person we shall not name here [Taxil] declared before an assembly especially convened for him that for twelve years he had prepared and carried out to the end the most sacrilegious of hoaxes. We have always been careful to publish special articles concerning Palladism and Diana Vaughan. We are now giving in this issue a complete list of these articles, which can now be considered as not having existed.&lt;ref&gt;''Freemasonry Disclosed'' April 1897&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Supporters of Freemasonry assert that, when Albert Pike and other Masonic scholars spoke about the "Luciferian path," or the "energies of Lucifer," they were referring to the Morning Star, the light bearer, the search for light; the very antithesis of dark. Pike says in Morals and Dogma, "Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it {{em|he}} who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish Souls? Doubt it not!"&lt;ref&gt;(Albert Pike, ''Morals and Dogma'', p. 321).&lt;/ref&gt; Much has been made of this quote.&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.masonicinfo.com/lucifer.htm Masonic information: Lucifer]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxil's work and Pike's address continue to be quoted by anti-masonic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.masonicinfo.com/taxil.htm |title=Leo Taxil: The tale of the Pope and the Pornographer |access-date=14 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Devil-Worship in France'', [[Arthur Edward Waite]] compared Taxil's work to today's [[tabloid journalism]], replete with logical and factual inconsistencies.

===Charles Godfrey Leland===
In a collection of folklore and magical practices supposedly collected in Italy by [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] and published in his ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'', the figure of Lucifer is featured prominently as both the brother and consort of the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], and father of [[Aradia]], at the center of an alleged Italian witch-cult.&lt;ref name="aradia_sardinia"&gt;Magliocco, Sabina. (2009). Aradia in Sardinia: The Archaeology of a Folk Character. Pp. 40-60 in ''Ten Years of Triumph of the Moon''. Hidden Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In Leland's mythology, Diana pursued her brother Lucifer across the sky as a cat pursues a mouse. According to Leland, after dividing herself into light and darkness:

{{blockquote|[...] Diana saw that the light was so beautiful, the light which was her other half, her brother Lucifer, she yearned for it with exceeding great desire. Wishing to receive the light again into her darkness, to swallow it up in rapture, in delight, she trembled with desire. This desire was the Dawn. But Lucifer, the light, fled from her, and would not yield to her wishes; he was the light which flies into the most distant parts of heaven, the mouse which flies before the cat.&lt;ref name="aradia"&gt;Charles G. Leland, ''Aradia: The Gospel of Witches'', Theophania Publishing, US, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here, the motions of Diana and Lucifer once again mirror the celestial motions of the moon and Venus, respectively.&lt;ref name="stregheria"&gt;Magliocco, Sabina. (2006). [https://www.academia.edu/584607/Italian_American_Stregheria_and_Wicca_Ethnic_ambivalence_in_American_Neopaganism Italian American Stregheria and Wicca: Ethnic Ambivalence in American Neopaganism]. Pp. 55-86 in Michael Strmiska, ed., ''Modern Paganism in World Cultures: Comparative Perspectives''. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-Clio.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Leland's Lucifer is based on the classical personification of the planet Venus, he also incorporates elements from Christian tradition, as in the following passage:

{{blockquote|Diana greatly loved her brother Lucifer, the god of the Sun and of the Moon, the god of Light (Splendor), who was so proud of his beauty, and who for his pride was driven from Paradise.&lt;ref name=aradia/&gt;}}

In the several modern [[Wiccan]] traditions based in part on Leland's work, the figure of Lucifer is usually either omitted or replaced as Diana's consort with either the Etruscan god [[Tagni]], or Dianus ([[Janus]], following the work of folklorist [[James Frazer]] in ''The Golden Bough'').&lt;ref name=aradia_sardinia/&gt;

'''Glycon''' ({{lang-grc|Γλύκων}} ''Glýkōn'', {{smallcaps|gen}}: {{lang|grc|Γλύκωνος}} ''Glýkōnos''), also spelled '''Glykon''', was an ancient [[snake worship|snake god]]. He had a large and influential cult within the [[Roman Empire]] in the 2nd century, with contemporary satirist [[Lucian]] providing the primary literary reference to the deity. Lucian claimed Glycon was created in the mid-2nd century by the Greek prophet [[Alexander of Abonoteichos]]. Lucian was ill-disposed toward the cult, calling Alexander a [[false prophet]] and accusing the whole enterprise of being a hoax: Glycon himself was supposedly a [[hand puppet]].&lt;ref&gt;{Λουκιανοῦ Ἀλέξανδρος ἢ Ψευδομάντις}, Lucian's "Alexander or the False Prophet", 18–20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macedonian cultural roots==
The cult possibly originated in [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], where similar snake cults had existed for centuries. The Macedonians believed snakes had magical powers [[Fertility rite|relating to fertility]] and had a rich mythology on this subject, for example the story of [[Olympias]]'s impregnation by [[Zeus]] disguised as a serpent.

==Early years==
At least initially, the cult did not worship an abstraction or a spirit of a snake but an actual, physical serpent that was said to embody the god. According to the cult's mythology, the snake appeared after Alexander had foretold the coming of a new incarnation of [[Asclepius]]. When the people gathered in the marketplace of Abonutichus at noon, when the incarnation was supposed to occur, Alexander produced a goose egg and sliced it open, revealing the god within. Within a week it grew to the size of a man with the features of a man on its face, including long blond hair. At this point the figure resembling this description was apparently a puppet that appeared in the temple. In some references Glycon was a trained snake with a puppet head.

As with previous Macedonian snake cults, the focus of worship at the temple was on fertility. Barren women would bring offerings to Glycon in hopes of becoming pregnant. According to Lucian, Alexander had less magical ways of causing pregnancy among his flock as well.

==Spread and influence==
[[File:Glycon bronze coin.jpg|thumb|Bronze coin of [[Antoninus Pius]] minted in [[Abonoteichos]] and showing the snake god Glycon with the legend “ΓΛVΚΩΝ ΑΒΩΝΟΤΕΙΧΕΙΤΩΝ” (29 mm, 16.89 g)]]

By 160, the worship of Glycon had undoubtedly spread beyond the Aegean. An inscription from [[Antioch]] of that date records a slogan, "Glycon protect us from the plague-cloud" that is consistent with the description we have from Lucian. Also in that year the [[Consul suffectus|governor]] of Asia, [[Publius Mummius Sisenna Rutilianus]], declared himself protector of Glycon's oracle. The governor later married Alexander's daughter. According to Lucian, another Roman governor, of [[Cappadocia]], was led by Glycon's oracle to his death in [[Armenia]], and even the Emperor himself was not immune to the cult: [[Marcus Aurelius]] sought prophesies from Alexander and his snake god.

Meanwhile, [[Abonoteichos]], a small fishing village before the arrival of the cult, became an important town and accepted another name, '''Ionopolis'''. It is uncertain what role the popularity of Glycon played in the rise of the city.

As the cult had an established popularity with the lower social strata,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eastern Cults in Moesia Inferior and Thracia (5th Century B.C.-4th Century A.D.)|last=Tacheva-Hitova|first=Margarita|publisher=Brill Publishers|year=Dec 1, 1983|isbn=9004295739|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later several important Roman functionaries and officials were counted among the believers in Glycon and the prophecies of Alexander,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Greek text of Lucian: Alexander or the False Prophet, with modern Greek translation by A.M. Harmon, 1925&lt;/ref&gt;  including the Emperor at the time, Marcus Aurelius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalziel|first=D.G.|date=February 1936|title=Alexander the Greater|journal=Greece &amp; Rome|volume= 5| issue =  14|pages=90–97|via=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such endorsement by the ruling classes coupled with pre existing superstitions of serpents as possessing healing powers, the cult of Glycon likely found no shortage of converts and adherents in new areas of the Roman world.

In short order Glycon worship was found throughout the vast area between the [[Danube]] and [[Euphrates]]. Beginning late in the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]] and continuing into the 3rd century, official Roman coins were struck in honor of Glycon, attesting his popularity. The Roman currency bearing the image of Glycon is known to have been in active circulation during 3rd century AD,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  however it is unknown if some of them were produced in this time period or if they remained in use after being produced earlier, during Alexander's life (c.105-c.170).

It is known that for at least a hundred years following Alexander's death a new Glycon cult began to spread its influence along areas adjacent to the Danube, with archaeological finds such as the statue discovered in Tomi (modern day [[Constanța]]) being interpreted by some to indicate the presence of a large public cult in the city.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

While the cult gradually lost followers after the death of its leader in c.170, it survived for at least a hundred years thereafter, with Alexander being incorporated into its mythology as a grandson of [[Asclepius]]. Given the prominence of snake cults as healing divinities in the Mediterranean and surrounding areas, both before and after the rise of Glycon in the region, the spread of the cult continued for some time following the death of Alexander. Some evidence indicates the cult survived into the 4th century. As the contemporary works of Lucian are the primary written reference to Glycon, its cult and their activities, what became of them exactly is unclear following the death of Alexander of Abonoteichos, due to lack of written record. &amp;nbsp;

==Modern times==
[[File:Bancnota 10000 lei din 1994.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Romanian 10.000 lei bank note of 1994, depicting Glycon in the center.]]
A marble statue of Glycon was found during an excavation under the former Pallas railway station in [[Constanța]], Romania. The statue is {{convert|66|cm}} tall and the length of the snake is {{convert|4.76|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;Vatamanu Nicolae: "Esculap reincarnat in Glycon, sarpele cu plete", ''[[Viața Medicală]]'' 1972, No.7 pg 333–335&lt;/ref&gt; It is on display at the [[Constanța History and Archaeology Museum]]. Romania commemorated this unique sculpture on a postage stamp in 1974, and on a bank note of 10,000 lei in 1994.

Having declared himself a [[ceremonial magician]] in 1993, the English [[comic book]] writer and [[occultist]] [[Alan Moore]] later described himself as a devotee of Glycon, preferring the belief in a hoax deity "because [he is] not likely to start believing that glove puppet created the universe or anything dangerous like that."&lt;ref name="SLATEDW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2092739/sidebar/2092745/ |title=Sidebar: How Alan Moore transformed American comics |last=Wolk |first=Douglas |author-link=Douglas Wolk |date=17 December 2003 |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |access-date=10 September 2008 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130202103137/http://www.slate.com/sidebars/2003/12/sidebar_6.html |archive-date=2 February 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Sterquilinus''' — also called '''Stercutus''' and '''Sterculius'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DSkBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA727&amp;dq=Sterculius&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfzOiG0JPWAhVqxoMKHVgpDKUQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Sterculius&amp;f=false Entry, "Sterculius, Stercutius, or Sterquilinus"], In: Smith, William (1858), ''A Classical Dictionary of Biography, Mythology and Geography'', 4th revised edition; London: [[John Murray (publishing house)|John Murray]], pg 725.&lt;/ref&gt; — was a god of [[odor]].&lt;ref&gt;Carter, W. Hodding (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wOaqkxplV_AC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq=Sterculius#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Flushed: How the Plumber Saved Civilization'']; [[Simon and Schuster]], pg 143.&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been equivalent to [[Picumnus (mythology)|Picumnus]]. The ''Larousse Encyclopaedia of Mythology'' gives the name as Stercutius, a pseudonym of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], under which the latter used to supervise the manuring of the fields.

The name Sterquilinus comes from the Latin ''stercus'' meaning "fertilizer" or "manure". His name was altered to avoid confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.godchecker.com/pantheon/roman-mythology.php?deity=STERCULIUS|title = STERCULIUS - the Roman God of Manure (Roman mythology)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Romans were an agrarian civilization and, functionally, most of their original pantheon of gods — as against the later ones they adapted to Greek stereotypes — were of a rural nature with figures such as [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]], [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]], [[Dea Dia]]; so it was apt to have a god supervising the basics of organic fertilization. Sterquilinus essentially taught the use of manure in agricultural processes. He was not the sole deity of feces on its own; as in, sewage.

Modern writers later elaborated upon and exaggerated the significance of Sterquilinus/Sterculius and other "earthy" deities of antiquity, sometimes with moralistic disapproval. One editor of ''An Encyclopædia of Plants'', published in 1836, related that &lt;blockquote&gt;Sterculius was the god of the privy, from ''stercus'', excrement. It has been well observed by a French author, that the Romans, in the madness of paganism, finished by deifying the most immodest objects and the most disgusting actions. They had the gods Sterculius, [[Crepitus (mythology)|Crepitus]], [[Priapus]]; and the goddesses [[Latin profanity#Cacāre: to defecate|Caca]], [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities#Conception and pregnancy|Pertunda]], &amp;c, &amp;c.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Claudius Loudon|Loudon, John Claudius]] (1836), editor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7vJ1GZJof0gC&amp;pg=PA815&amp;lpg=PA815&amp;dq=%22Sterculius+Crepitus%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=npkwi41wEs&amp;sig=ddAgbZ5M5zku5O5ZHkBGyVprWUg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1y9KJ1pPWAhVrzIMKHdmBDMYQ6AEIMjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sterculius%20Crepitus%22&amp;f=false ''An Encyclopædia of Plants'']; London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, and Longman, pg 815. This quote is from a section on the plant genus ''[[Sterculia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Popular culture references==
Sterculius was featured in "[[Peace, Love and Understanding]]" (1992), the second [[pilot episode]] of ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', where his spirit rose from a [[port-a-potty]] crushed by a [[monster truck]]; he is correctly identified by [[Butt-Head]].
