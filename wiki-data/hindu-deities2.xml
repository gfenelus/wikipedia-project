'''Ribhus''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ऋभु, ṛbhu, also Arbhu, Rbhus, Ribhuksan) is an [[ancient India]]n word whose meaning evolved over time.&lt;ref name="CoulterTurner2013p918"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Russell Coulter|author2=Patricia Turner|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWxekbhM1yEC|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-96397-2|page=918|chapter=Ribhus}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early layers of the Vedic literature, it referred to a sun deity.&lt;ref name="CoulterTurner2013p918"/&gt; It evolved to being a wind deity, thereafter referred to three male artisans whose abilities and austerities make them into divinities in later Vedic texts.&lt;ref name="CoulterTurner2013p918"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=HH Wilson|title=Rig-Veda-Sanhita, The First Ashtaka or Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yJ4-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA46|edition=2nd|year=1866|publisher=London: Trubner &amp; Co.|pages=46–48 with footnotes, 284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their individual names were Ribhu (or Rhibhu), Vaja and Vibhvan (also called Vibhu), but they were collectively called '''Rhibhus''' or '''Ribhus''' ({{IAST|ṛbhú-}}, pl. ṛbhava, also called Ribhuksan). Their name's meaning is "clever, skillful, inventive, prudent", cognate to [[Latin]] ''labor'' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''arb-aiþs'' "labour, toil", and perhaps to English ''[[elf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;suggested in [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ribhus are depicted in some legends of the Vedic literature as three sons of the goddess of morning light named ''Saranyu'' and Hindu god [[Indra]].&lt;ref name="CoulterTurner2013p918"/&gt; In other legends, such as in the [[Atharvaveda]], they are sons of ''Sudhanvan'', which means good archer.&lt;ref name="CoulterTurner2013p918"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffith1895p270"/&gt; In either legends, they are famous for their creative abilities, innovation and they design chariots, the magic cow of plenty, channels for rivers, and tools for Indra and other gods, which makes many envious.&lt;ref name="CoulterTurner2013p918"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=HH Wilson|title=Rig-Veda-Sanhita, The First Ashtaka or Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yJ4-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA46|edition=2nd|year=1866|publisher=London: Trubner &amp; Co.|pages=46–48 with footnotes, 135, 171, 283–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later Hindu mythology, the Ribhus are born in human form who then bring their innovation to earth, remain humble and kind.&lt;ref name="CoulterTurner2013p918"/&gt; This makes some gods angry and the Ribhus are refused entry back to heaven.&lt;ref name="CoulterTurner2013p918"/&gt; Other gods intervene and make the inventive Ribhus immortal. They are revered in ancient Hindu texts as sages, as stars, or rays of the sun.&lt;ref name="CoulterTurner2013p918"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffith1895p270"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ralph Thomas Hotchkin Griffith|title=The Hymns of the Atharvaveda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L9YoAAAAYAAJ|year=1895|publisher=E. J. Lazarus &amp; Company|pages=270 footnote 3 on The Sages|isbn=9780524075036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and meaning==
The Ribhus were first mentioned in the oldest [[Hindu]] scriptures of the [[Rigveda]], wherein eleven hymns are dedicated to them ([[Mandala 1|RV 1]].20, 110, 111, 161, [[Mandala 3|RV 3]].60, [[Mandala 4|RV 4]].33-37, [[RV 7]].48), and the [[Atharvaveda]]. They are said to be the sons of Sudhanvan, a descendant of [[Angiras (sage)|Angiras]].&lt;ref&gt;''RigVeda Samhita'' Vol.I According to the translation of [[H.H. Wilson]] and Bhasya of Sayanacarya by Ravi Prakash Arya and K.L.Joshi&lt;/ref&gt; In later [[Hindu mythology]] ([[Vishnu Purana]] Book 2, Chapters 15 - 16&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Wilson ''The Vishnu Purana A System of Hindhu Mythology And Tradition'', Delhi 1980, Reprint 2003, Vol.1 p.366 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Song of Ribhu''&lt;ref&gt;''The Song of Ribhu: Translated from the Original [[Tamil language|Tamil]] version of [[Ribhu Gita]]'': Translated by Dr. H. Ramamoorthy and [[Nome, Spiritual Teacher|Nome]], Published by [[Society of Abidance in Truth]]&lt;/ref&gt;) Ribhu, supposed to be the leader of them, is said to be a son of [[Brahma]]. Unlike that identification the "[[Puranic]] Encyclopedia" states that this Ribhu is not identical with the leader of the Ribhus whose name therein is Rbhuksan.&lt;ref&gt;Vettam Mani ''Puranic Encyclopedia'', Delhi 1975, 9th Reprint 2010, p.647&lt;/ref&gt; They are supposed to dwell in the solar sphere; [[Aitareya Brahmana]] III, 30 describes them as "sun's neighbours or pupils".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] ''[[The Orion (Book)|The Orion, Or, Researches Into The Antiquity Of The Vedas]]'', Reprinted from 1893 Edition Delhi 2008, p.167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

The Ribhus are artists who formed the horses of Indra, the carriage of the [[Ashvins]], and the miraculous cow of [[Brihaspati]], made their parents young, and performed other wonderful works which according to [[Mandala 4|RV 4]].51.6 were "done by the dawn".&lt;ref&gt;''The Orion'', p.167&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Yaska]] they also founded the sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;''Dates and Eras in Ancient Indian History'' Vol.1, p.76, Note 72&lt;/ref&gt; They are supposed to take their ease and remain every year for twelve days idle in the house of Agohya (an appellation of [[Aditya]] which means "one who cannot be concealed", therefore the Sun).&lt;ref&gt;''Dates and Eras in Ancient Indian History'' Vol.1, p.53&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] (gods) heard of their skill, they sent [[Agni]] to them,  bidding them, to construct four cups from the one cup of [[Tvashtar]], the artificer of the devas. When the Ribhus successfully had executed this task, the devas received them among themselves, gave them immortality and allowed them to partake of their sacrifices.

==Interpretations==

===Three Seasons===

According to Yaska and Sayana the Ribhus represent the rays of the sun. [[David Frawley]] states about that notion, that "Vedic gods, like the Adityas, Maruts, Vasus and Rhibhus, often appear as rays of the sun, as stars or constellations"&lt;ref&gt;''Gods, Sages and Kings'', p.169&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], stating that the interpretation of Yaska and Sayana could not explain their number, interpreted them 1893 referring to "several European scholars" as representing the three seasons of the year of the early Vedic period.&lt;ref&gt;''The Orion'', p.167; ''Dates and Eras in Ancient Indian History'' Vol.1, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; The Satapata [[Brahmana]] XIV.I.1.28 mentions "three divisions of the year"&lt;ref&gt;''Dates and Eras of Ancient Indian History'' Vol.1, p.76, Note 73&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Mandala 1|RV 1]].164.48 the "three spokes" are supposed to mean this three seasons.&lt;ref&gt;''Dates and Eras in Ancient Indian History'' Vol.1, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; But Tilak didn't show a relation of their name and works to this interpretation. So [[Arthur Berriedale Keith]] 1925 mentioned that "the assertion that the Rbhus are really the Rthus" (the seasons) "is not 'in the slightest degree plausible'".&lt;ref&gt;''Dates and Eras in Ancient Indian History'' Vol.1, p.76, Note 85, referring to A.B. Keith ''Philosophy and Religion in the Veda and Upanishads'' Vol.1, p.178&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twelve intercalary Days===

====Description====
According to  Bal Gangadhar Tilak referring to [[Mandala 1|RV 1]].161.13 the twelve days, when the Ribhus rested at the house of Agohya, took place "at the end of the year".&lt;ref name="The Orion, p.113 f"&gt;''The Orion'', p.113 f.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes them as the holiest days of the year of which the ancestors of today's Indians believed, that the devas then would leave heaven to visit the homes of the humans.&lt;ref&gt;Bal Gangadhar Tilak ''The Orion'', p.139&lt;/ref&gt;  As David Frawley mentioned in context of the seasons, according to [[RV 7]].103.7 - 8 also as the long [[Atiratra]] rite of [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] was celebrated at this time.&lt;ref&gt;David Frawley ''Gods, Sages And Kings'', first Indian Edition, Delhi 1993, p.173&lt;/ref&gt;

Bal Gangadhar Tilak further interpreted the hound or dog, which according to [[Mandala 1|RV 1]].161.13 woke the Ribhus, as the "dogstar" [[Sirius]], which appears at the [[March equinox|vernal equinox]] "at the end of the Pitriyana".&lt;ref name="The Orion, p.113 f"/&gt; The "Pitriyana" (meaning "the path of the fathers", called [[Pitrs]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Gods, Sages And Kings'', p.177&lt;/ref&gt; are the six southern signs of the [[Zodiak]], by Tilak also called "the eternal waters of Yamaloka".&lt;ref&gt;''The Orion'', p.114, see also p.109&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrative Maitrayani [[Upanishad]] VI, 1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gatewayforindia.com/upanishad/maitrayeni_upanishad.htm|title = Maitrayani Upanishad}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the year as divided into two halfes, one of which belongs to Agni (Fire) and the other to [[Varuna]] (Water).&lt;ref&gt;''Gods, Sages And Kings'', p.157&lt;/ref&gt; Thus according to Bal Gangadhar Tilak in 1893 the year started at the time of the ''Rigveda'' at the vernal equinox&lt;ref&gt;''The Orion'', p.170&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ribhus recommenced working after their awakening in the beginning of the new year.&lt;ref&gt;''The Orion'', p.169&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Dwight Whitney]] 1895 rejected this interpretation by Tilak.&lt;ref&gt;''Dates and Eras of Ancient Indian History'' Vol.1, p.52 f., referring to W.D. Whithey in ''Indian Antiquity''&lt;/ref&gt; In this context Tilak also pointed to the fact that because of [[Mandala 1|RV 1]].161.13 not the solar year but the anticlockwise movement of the [[precession of the equinoxes]] must be meant which he calls an "equinoctial year",&lt;ref&gt;''The Orion'', p.169, compare p.115&lt;/ref&gt; but he didn't refer to this in his further interpretation.

====Interpretation====
Bal Gangadhar Tilak then interpreted also in 1893 the Period of twelve days as the twelve [[intercalary day]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''The Orion'', p.168 f.&lt;/ref&gt; to fix the difference between the [[lunar year]] of 354 days and the [[solar year]] of 366 days.&lt;ref&gt;''Dates and Eras in Ancient Indian History'' Vol.1, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; While he interpreted the beginning of the year at the vernal equinox, [[Arthur Anthony Macdonell]] 1917 stated that the twelve intercalary days "in all probability" were inserted at the [[winter solstice]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dates and Eras in Ancient Indian History'' Vol.1, p.76, Note 86, referring to A.A. Macdonell ''A History of Sanscrit Literature'', p.106&lt;/ref&gt; A.B. Keith 1925 also criticized Tilak's interpretation by pointing to "... the fact that a year of 360 days and 12 months is ... the only year clearly known to the whole of Vedic literarure prior to the late Sutras".&lt;ref&gt;''Dates and Eras in Ancient Indian History'' Vol.1, p.56, referring to A.B. Keith ''Philosophy and Religion of the Veda and Upanishads'' Vol.1&lt;/ref&gt; Because he also "admits that ancient Indians had knowledge of intercalation" his statements on that point are considered "confused".&lt;ref&gt;''Dates and Eras in Ancient Indian History'' Vol.1, p.57; 56&lt;/ref&gt; But already 1895 a similar view in terms of the length of the year was stated by [[George Thibaut]]&lt;ref&gt;''Dates and Eras in Ancient Indian History'' Vol.1, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; and W.D. Whitney&lt;ref name="Ancient Indian History Vol p.57"&gt;''Dates and Eras in Ancient Indian History'' Vol.1, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Indian Antiquity''. In 1960 Narendra Nath Law wrote in ''Indian Antiquity Quarterly'' that: "W&lt;hitney&gt; would be correct if the 7th season or the 13th month (presumably for intercalation) had not been mentionend."&lt;ref name="Ancient Indian History Vol p.57"/&gt; He was referring to [[Mandala 1|RV 1]].164.15 which was interpreted by [[H.H. Wilson]] as describing seven seasons.&lt;ref&gt;''Dates and Eras in Ancient Indian History'' Vol.1, p.55, referring to H.H. Wilson ''Rigveda'' (Translation) Vol.2, p.131 f.&lt;/ref&gt; But according to the translation of [[Ralph Thomas Hotchkin Griffith]] [[Mandala 1|RV 1]].164.15 means the seven [[Rishis]],&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Thomas Hotchkin Griffith ''The Hymns of the Rigveda'' Vol.1, Benares 1889, Reprint USA 2012, p.286&lt;/ref&gt; which according to David Frawley were actually eight seers, representing the [[Big Dipper]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gods, Sages and Kings'', p.167&lt;/ref&gt; The eighth star of the big dipper is according to his later reference to [[Mandala 3|RV 3]].56.2 in connexion with [[Mandala 1|RV 1]].164.15 not the unseen fourth star of the handle forming a double star system  but the [[Pole Star]] around which the big dipper rotates.&lt;ref&gt;''Gods, Sages and Kings'', p.172, refer also p.167, the 8th seer&lt;/ref&gt; Already [[Moritz Winternitz]] 1907 pointed "to the fact that there are certain passages in the Vedic texts which admid of various interpretations."&lt;ref&gt;''Dates and Eras in Ancient Indian History'' Vol.1, p.49, referring to M. Winternitz ''A History of Indian Literature'' Vol.1, German 1907, English translation 1927, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; So A.B. Keith's and A.A. Macdonell's 1912 statement is still applicable, the 12 days were "merely the 'reflexion of the year' (samvatsarasya pratima) in the same way that they represent the twelve months and have no relation to chronology at all."&lt;ref&gt;''Dates and Eras in Ancient Indian History'' Vol.1, p.57, referring to A.B. Keith and A.A. Macdonell ''Vedic Index of Names and Subjects'' Vol.2 "Samvatsara", p.411-13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bhaga''''' is the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] god of wealth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kulasrestha |first=Mahendra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OIoRWGSfMikC&amp;dq=bhaga+wealth+book&amp;pg=PA90 |title=The Golden Book of Rigveda |date=2006 |publisher=Lotus Press |isbn=978-81-8382-010-3 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a term for "[[lord]], [[patron]]" and "wealth, prosperity". He is an [[Ādityas|Āditya]], a group of societal deities who are the sons of [[Aditi]]. Bhaga's responsibility was to make sure that people received a share of the goods in life. He is associated with his brother, [[Aryaman]], regarding the expectation of a successful marriage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephanie Jamison|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1LTRDwAAQBAJ|title=The Rigveda –– Earliest Religious Poetry of India|last2=Brereton|first2=Joel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0190633394|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The cognate term in [[Avestan]] and [[Old Persian]] is ''{{lang|peo-Latn|baga}}'', of uncertain meaning but used in a sense in which "lord, patron, sharer/distributor of good fortune" might also apply.&lt;!-- Uncertain: Since adjectives follow the noun, it might be an epithet of the preceding name, eg "Lord X". Alternatively, it might be part of a [[dvandvah]] compound, i.e. read as "X (and) Baga," which would imply Baga is a specific figure (cf. Ahura Mazda for various considerations). --&gt; The cognate in [[Slavic languages]] is the root [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic/bogъ#Etymology|bogъ]]. The [[semantics]] is similar to [[English language|English]] ''[[lord]]'' (from ''[[:wikt:hlaford|hlaford]]'' "bread-warden"), the idea being that it is part of the function of a chieftain or leader to distribute riches or spoils among his followers. The name of the city of [[Baghdad]] derives from [[Middle Persian]] ''baga-data'', "lord-given".

== Role ==
=== In Sanskrit religious literature ===
In the [[Rigveda|Rigveda Samhita]], Bhaga is invoked and praised as the "sustainer of the world", "giver of wealth", "chief leader of rites", and "possessor of opulence". He is asked to bestow upon his adherents cattle and horses, male issue, felicity, and riches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tf0xYQRrsgC&amp;dq=bhaga+wealth+book&amp;pg=PA108 |title=Rig-Veda Sanhitá a Collection of Ancient Hindú Hymns, Constituting the Fifth Ashtaka, Or Book of the Reg-Veda ... Translated from the Original Sanskrit by the Late H. H. Wilson |date=1866 |publisher=N. Trübner |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Sanskrit [[Rigveda]], ''bhaga'' is an epithet of both mortals and gods (e.g. of [[Savitr]], [[Indra]] and [[Agni]]) who bestow wealth and prosperity, as well as the personification of a particular god, ''the'' Bhaga, who bestows the same. In the Rigveda, the personification is attested primarily in ''RV'' 7.41, which is devoted to the praise of the Bhaga and of the deities closest to him, and in which the Bhaga is invoked about 60 times, together with Agni, Indra, the [[Dvandva|dual]] [[Mitra-Varuna]], the two [[Ashvins]], [[Pushan|Pusan]], [[Brahmanaspati]], [[Soma (deity)|Soma]] and [[Rudra]]. Bhaga is also invoked elsewhere in the company of Indra, [[Varuna]] and [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]] (e.g. ''RV'' 10.35, 42.396). The personification is occasionally intentionally ambiguous, as in ''RV'' 5.46 where men are portrayed as requesting the Bhaga to share in ''bhaga''. In the Rigveda, the Bhaga is occasionally associated with the sun: in ''RV'' 1.123, the Dawn ([[Ushas]]) is said to be the Bhaga's sister, and in ''RV'' 1.136, the Bhaga's eye is adorned with rays.

The 5th/6th-century BCE ''[[Nirukta]]'' (''Nir.'' 12.13) describes Bhaga as the god of the morning. In the Rigveda, the Bhaga is named as one of the [[Adityas]], the seven (or eight) celestial sons of [[Aditi]], the Rigvedic mother of the gods. In the medieval [[Bhagavata Purana]], the Bhaga reappears with the Puranic Adityas, which are by then twelve solar gods.

== Legacy ==
Elsewhere, the Bhaga continues as a god of wealth and marriage, in a role that is also attested for the [[Sogdian language|Sogdian (Buddhist)]] equivalent of the Bhaga.

The common noun ''bhaga'' survives in the 2nd century CE inscription of [[Rudradaman I]], where it is a fiscal term; in ''[[bhagavan]]'' for "one who possesses (''-van'') the properties of a ''bhaga-''", hence itself "lord, god"; and in ''bhagya'', and "that which derives from ''bhaga''", hence "[[destiny]]" as an abstract noun, and also ''Bhagya'' personified as the proper name of a son of [[Surya]].

Bhaga is also the presiding deity of the [[Purva Phalgunī]] Nakshatra.

'''Kubera''' ({{lang-sa|कुबेर|translit=Kubera}}) also known as  '''Kuvera''', '''Kuber''' and ''' Kuberan''', is the god of wealth, and the god-king of the semi-divine [[yakshas]] in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qmUssUXUFFYC&amp;pg=PA359 |title=The Poems of Sūradāsa|publisher=Abhinav publications|year=1999|isbn=9788170173694}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is regarded as [[Guardians of the directions|the regent of the north (''Dikpala'')]], and a protector of the world (''[[Lokapala]]''). His many epithets extol him as the overlord of numerous semi-divine species, and the owner of the treasures of the world. Kubera is often depicted with a plump body, adorned with jewels, and carrying a money-pot and a club.

Originally described as the chief of evil spirits in [[Veda|Vedic]]-era texts, Kubera acquired the status of a ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' (god) only in the [[Puranas|''Purana''s]] and the [[Hindu epic]]s. The scriptures describe that Kubera once ruled [[Lanka]], but was overthrown by his half-brother [[Ravana]], later settling in the city of [[Alaka]] in the [[Himalayas]]. Descriptions of the "glory" and "splendour" of Kubera's city are found in many scriptures.

Kubera has also been assimilated into the [[Buddhist]] and [[Jain]] pantheons. In Buddhism, he is known as [[Vaisravana]], the patronymic used of the Hindu Kubera and is also equated with [[Pañcika]], while in Jainism, he is known as '''Sarvanubhuti'''.

==Iconography==
Kubera is often depicted as a dwarf, with complexion of lotus leaves and a big belly. He is described as having three legs, only eight teeth, one eye, and being adorned with jewels. He is sometimes depicted riding a man.&lt;ref name="knapp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; The description of deformities like the broken teeth, three legs, three heads and [[Chaturbhuja|four arms]] appear only in the later ''Puranic'' texts.&lt;ref name="H147"&gt;{{harvnb|Hopkins|1915|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubera holds a mace, a pomegranate, or a money bag in his hand.&lt;ref name="knapp" /&gt; He may also carry a sheaf of jewels or a [[mongoose]] with him. In Tibet, the mongoose is considered a symbol of Kubera's victory over [[nāga]]s—the guardians of treasures.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt; Kubera is usually depicted with a mongoose in Buddhist iconography.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

[[File:British Museum Ganesha Matrikas Kubera.jpg|thumb|A bronze [[Matrika]] goddess group along with [[Ganesha]] (left) and Kubera (right) currently at the [[British Museum]]. Originally from Eastern India, it was dedicated in 43rd year of reign of [[Mahipala]] I (c. 1043 AD).|280x280px]]
In the ''[[Vishnudharmottara Purana]]'', Kubera is described as the embodiment of both ''[[Artha]]'' ("wealth, prosperity, glory") and ''[[Arthashastra]]''s, the treatises related to it—and his iconography mirrors it. Kubera's complexion is described as that of lotus leaves. He rides a man—the [[State (polity)|state]] personified, adorned in golden clothes and ornaments, symbolizing his wealth. His left eye is yellow. He wears an armour and a necklace down to his large belly. The ''Vishnudharmottara Purana'' further describes his face to be inclined to the left, sporting a beard and mustache, and with two small tusks protruding from the ends of his mouth, representing his powers to punish and to bestow favours. His wife Riddhi, representing the journey of life, is seated on his left lap, with her left hand on the back of Kubera and the right holding a ''ratna-patra'' (jewel-pot). Kubera should be four-armed, holding a ''gada'' (mace: symbol of  ''dandaniti''—administration of justice) and a ''[[shakti]]'' (power) in his left pair, and standards bearing a lion—representing ''Artha'' and a ''shibika'' (a club, the weapon of Kubera). The ''[[nidhi]]'' treasures Padma and Shankha stand beside him in human form, with their heads emerging from a lotus and a conch respectively.&lt;ref name="prakash"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prakash|first=Om|editor=Nagendra Kumar Singh|title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism  |year=2000|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. LTD|isbn=81-7488-168-9|pages=41–4|chapter=Artha and Arthasastra in the Puranic Iconography and their symbolic implications|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UG9-HZ5icQ4C&amp;q=kubera&amp;pg=PA43|volume = 31–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Agni Purana]]'' states that Kubera should be installed in temples as seated on a goat, and with a club in his hand.&lt;ref name = "Mani"/&gt; Kubera's image is prescribed to be that of gold, with multi-coloured attributes.&lt;ref name="Alain"/&gt; In some sources, especially in [[Jain]] depictions, Kubera is depicted as a drunkard, signified by the "nectar vessel" in his hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sutherland|1991|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and other names==
The exact origins of the name Kubera are unknown.&lt;ref name="Alain"/&gt; "Kubera" or "Kuvera" (कुवेर) as spelt in later Sanskrit, means "deformed or monstrous" or "ill-shaped one"; indicating his deformities.&lt;ref name="Alain"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "monier"&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0291-kudri.jpg Monier-Williams Dictionary: Kubera]&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory suggests that Kubera may be derived from the verb root ''kumba'', meaning to conceal. Kuvera is also split as ''ku'' (earth), and ''vira'' (hero).&lt;ref name = "S63"/&gt;

As the son of [[Vishrava]] ("Fame"), Kubera is called ''[[Vaisravana]]'' (in the [[Pali language]], Vessavana) and as the son of Ilavila, ''Ailavila''.&lt;ref name = "H142"&gt;{{harvnb|Hopkins|1915|pp=142–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaisravana is sometimes translated as the "Son of Fame".&lt;ref name="Alain"/&gt; The ''Sutta Nitapa'' commentary says that ''Vaisravana'' is derived from a name of Kubera's kingdom, ''Visana''.&lt;ref name = "S63"/&gt; Once, Kubera looked at Shiva and his wife [[Parvati]] with jealousy, so he lost one of his eyes. Parvati also turned this deformed eye yellow. So, Kubera gained the name ''Ekaksipingala'' ("one who has one yellow eye").&lt;ref name = "Mani"/&gt; He is also called ''Bhutesha'' ("Lord of spirits") like Shiva. Kubera usually is drawn by spirits or men (''nara''), so is called ''Nara-vahana'', one whose ''[[vahana]]'' (mount) is ''nara''. [[Edward Washburn Hopkins|Hopkins]] interprets ''nara''s as being water-spirits, although Mani translates ''nara'' as men.&lt;ref name = "Mani"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "H144"/&gt; Kubera also rides the elephant called ''Sarvabhauma'' as a ''loka-pala''.&lt;ref name = "H142"/&gt; His garden is named Chaitrarath.&lt;ref name="Madan"/&gt;

Kubera also enjoys the titles "king of the whole world", "king of kings" (''Rajaraja''), "Lord of wealth" (''Dhanadhipati'') and "giver of wealth" (''Dhanada''). His titles are sometimes related to his subjects: "king of [[yaksha]]s" (''Yaksharajan''), "Lord of [[rakshasa]]s" (''Rakshasadhipati''), "Lord of [[Guhyaka]]s" (''Guhyakadhipa''), "king of [[Kinnara]]s"(''Kinnararaja''), "king of animals resembling men" (''Mayuraja''), and "king of men" (''Nararaja'').&lt;ref name="Alain"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "H142"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "H144"/&gt; Kubera is also called ''Guhyadhipa'' ("Lord of the hidden"). The ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' calls him the "god of hiding".&lt;ref name = "H144"/&gt;

==Literature==
[[File:Kubera - Circa 1st Century CE - Kosi Kalan - ACCN 18-1506 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-23 5710.JPG|thumb|Kubera, 1st century CE, [[Mathura Museum]].]]

===Early descriptions and parentage===
In the ''Atharvaveda''—where he first appears&lt;ref name="Alain"&gt;{{cite book|last= Daniélou|first=Alain|title=The myths and gods of India|year=1964|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Company|pages=135–7|chapter=Kubera, the Lord of Riches}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'', Kubera is the chief of evil spirits or spirits of darkness, and son of Vaishravana.&lt;ref name = "monier"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "williams"/&gt; The ''Shatapatha Brahmana'' calls him the Lord of thieves and criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbr/sbe44/sbe44104.htm|title=Satapatha Brahmana Part V (SBE44): Thirteenth Kâ''n''''d''a: XIII, 4, 3. Third Brâhmana (13.4.3.10)|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Manusmriti]]'', he becomes a respectable ''lokapala'' ("world protector") and the patron of merchants.&lt;ref name = "S63"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sutherland|1991|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', Kubera is described as the son of ''[[Prajapati]]'' [[Pulastya]] and his wife Idavida, and the brother of sage [[Vishrava]]. Kubera is described as born from a cow. However, from the ''Purana''s, he is described as the grandson of Pulastya and the son of Vishrava and his wife [[Ilavida]] (or Ilivila or Devavarnini), daughter of the sage [[Bharadvaja]] or Trinabindu.&lt;ref name = "Mani"&gt;{{cite book|author = Mani, Vettam|title = Puranic Encyclopaedia: A Comprehensive Dictionary With Special Reference to the Epic and Puranic Literature|url = https://archive.org/details/puranicencyclopa00maniuoft|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass|year = 1975|location = Delhi|isbn = 0-8426-0822-2|pages = [https://archive.org/details/puranicencyclopa00maniuoft/page/434 434]–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alain"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "H142"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "williams"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=George Mason|title=Handbook of Hindu mythology|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-85109-650-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9791576071068/page/190 190–1]|chapter=Kubera|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9791576071068/page/190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, though still described as an ''[[asura]]'', Kubera is offered prayers at the end of all ritual sacrifices.&lt;ref name = "williams"/&gt; His titles, such as "best of kings" and "Lord of kings" (The''[[Harivamsa]]'' indicates that Kubera is made "Lord of kings"), in contrast to the god-king of heaven, [[Indra]], whose title of "best of gods" led to the later belief that Kubera was a man. The early texts ''Gautama [[Dharmaśāstra|Dharmashastra]]'' and ''[[Apastamba]]'' describe him as a man. Only the ''[[Grhya Sutras#Grhya Sutras|Grihyasutra]]''s of Shankhayana and Hiranyakesin call him a god, and suggest offerings of meat, sesame seeds and flowers to him.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "H146"&gt;{{harvnb|Hopkins|1915|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puranic and epic descriptions===

The ''Purana''s and the epics ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana]]'' grant Kubera unquestioned godhood.&lt;ref name="prakash" /&gt; Kubera also acquired the status of the "Lord of riches" and the wealthiest Deva. He also becomes a ''lokapala'' ("world protector") and [[Guardians of the directions|guardian (''dikapala'') of the North direction]], although he is also sometimes associated with the East.&lt;ref name="H142" /&gt;&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt; Kubera's status as a ''lokapala'' and a ''dikpala'' is assured in the ''Ramayana'', but in the ''Mahabharata'', some lists do not include Kubera. Thus, Kubera is considered a later addition to the original list of ''Loka-pala''s, where the gods [[Agni]] or [[Soma (deity)|Soma]] appear in his place.&lt;ref&gt;For Loka-palas, {{harvnb|Hopkins|1915|pp=149–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; This status, the ''Ramayana'' records, was granted to Kubera by [[Brahma]]—the creator-god and father of Pulastya—as a reward for his severe penance. Brahma also conferred upon Kubera the riches of the world (''[[Nidhi]]s''), "equality with gods", and the [[Pushpaka Vimana]], a flying chariot. Kubera then ruled in the golden city of [[Lanka]], identified with modern-day [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name="Mani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="H142" /&gt; The ''Mahabharata'' says that Brahma conferred upon Kubera the lordship of wealth, friendship with Shiva, godhood, status as a world-protector, a son called ''Nalakubera''/''Nalakubara'', the Pushpaka Vimana and the lordship of the ''Nairrata'' demons.&lt;ref name="H142" /&gt;

Both the ''Purana''s and the ''Ramayana'' feature the half-blood siblings of Kubera. Vishrava, Kubera's father, also married the ''[[rakshasa]]'' (demigod) princess [[Kaikesi]], who mothered four ''rakshasa'' children: [[Ravana]], the chief antagonist of the Ramayana, and his siblings, [[Kumbhakarna]], [[Vibhishana]], and [[Soorpanaka|Shurpanaka]].&lt;ref name="Mani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt; The ''Mahabharata'' regards Vishrava as the brother of Kubera, so Kubera is described as the uncle of Ravana and his siblings. It records that when Kubera approached Brahma for the favour of superseding his father Pulastya, Pulastya created Vishrava. To seek the favour of Vishrava, Kubera sent three women to him, by whom Vishrava begot his demon children.&lt;ref name="H142" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wilkins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkins|first=W. J. |title=Hindu Mythology, Vedic and Puranic|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/hmvp/hmvp39.htm|year=1990|publisher=Sacred texts archive|pages=388–93|isbn=1-4021-9308-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ravana, after acquiring a boon of Brahma, drove Kubera away from Lanka and seized his Pushpaka Vimana, which was returned to Kubera after Ravana's death. Kubera then settled on Gandhamandana mountain, near [[Mount Kailash]] – the abode of the god [[Shiva]]—in the [[Himalayas]]. Sometimes, Kailash itself is called Kubera's residence. His city is usually called [[Alaka]] or Alaka-puri ("curl-city"), but also ''Prabha'' ("splendour"), ''Vasudhara'' ("bejeweled") and ''Vasu-sthali'' ("abode of treasures").&lt;ref name="Mani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="H142" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Madan"&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= [https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada/page/65 65]|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Kubera had a grove called ''Caitraratha'', where the leaves were jewels and the fruits were girls of heaven. There is also a charming lake called ''Nalini'' in the grove.&lt;ref name="H142" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wilkins" /&gt; Kubera is often described as a friend of Shiva in the epics.&lt;ref name="knapp" /&gt; The ''[[Padma Purana]]'' says that Kubera prayed to Shiva for many years, and Shiva granted him the kingship of yakshas.&lt;ref name="Mani" /&gt;

[[File:Kubera, the God of Riches LACMA M.69.13.8 (1 of 9).jpg|thumb|left|An 11th century Kubera, [[Karnataka]].]]
A description of Kubera's magnificent court appears in the ''Mahabharata'' as well as the ''[[Meghaduta]]''. Here, gandharvas and [[apsara]]s entertain Kubera. Shiva and his wife [[Parvati]] often frequent Kubera's court, which is attended by semi-divine beings like the ''[[vidyadhara]]s''; ''[[Kimpurusha Kingdom|kimpurusha]]s''; rakshasas; ''[[pishacha]]s''; as well as Padma and Shankha; personified treasures (''[[nidhi]]''); and Manibhadra, Kubera's chief attendant and chief of his army. Like every world-protector, Kubera has seven seers of the North in residence. Alaka is recorded to be plundered by Ravana once, and attacked by the [[Pandava]] prince, [[Bhima]] once.&lt;ref name="prakash" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="H142" /&gt;&lt;ref name="H144"&gt;{{harvnb|Hopkins|1915|pp=144–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubera's ''Nairrata'' army is described to have defeated king Mucukunda, who then defeated them by the advice of his guru [[Vashishta]]. [[Shukra]], the preceptor of the asuras, is also recorded to have defeated Kubera and stolen his wealth.&lt;ref name="H147" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mani" /&gt; Another major tale in the scriptures records how Kubera entertained the sage [[Ashtavakra]] in his palace.&lt;ref name="H147" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mani" /&gt;

Kubera is the treasurer of the gods, and the overlord of the semi-divine yakshas, the ''[[guhyaka]]''s, ''[[kinnara]]''s and gandharvas, who act as his assistants and protectors of the jewels of the earth, as well as guardians of his city. Kubera is also the guardian of travelers and the giver of wealth to individuals, who please him. The rakshasas also serve Kubera,&lt;ref name="knapp"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knapp|first=Stephen |title=The Heart of Hinduism: The Eastern Path to Freedom, Empowerment and Illumination| year=2005|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=0-595-79779-2|pages=192–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, some cannibalistic rakshasas are described to have sided with Ravana in the battle against Kubera.&lt;ref name="H142" /&gt; Kubera also developed as minor marriage-divinity. He is invoked with Shiva at weddings and is described as ''Kameshvara'' ("Lord of ''[[Kama]]'' – pleasure, desire etc.").&lt;ref name="H148"&gt;{{harvnb|Hopkins|1915|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is associated with fertility of the aquatic type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sutherland|1991|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Purana''s and the ''Mahabharata'' record that Kubera married [[Bhadra]] ("auspicious"), or Kauberi ("wife of Kubera"), daughter of the [[Danava (Hinduism)|demon]] Mura. She is also called ''Yakshi'' – a female yaksha and ''Charvi'' ("splendour"). They had three sons: [[Nalakuvara|Nalakubara]] ("Reed-axle"), [[Manibhadra|Manigriva]] ("Bejewled-neck") or Varna-kavi ("Colourful poet"), and Mayuraja ("king of animals resembling men"); and a daughter called Minakshi ("fish-eyed").&lt;ref name="knapp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wilkins" /&gt;

==Worship==
As the treasurer of the riches of the world, Kubera is prescribed to be worshipped. Kubera is also credited money to the deity [[Venkateshwara]] (a form of Vishnu) for his marriage with [[Alamelu|Padmavati]]. In remembrance of this, the reason devotees go to [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple|Tirupati]] to donate money in Venkateshwara's ''Hundi'' ("Donation pot"), is so that he can pay it back to Kubera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fairs and Festivals of India|date=September 2006|publisher=Pustak Mahal|isbn=81-223-0951-8|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also associated with [[Lakshmi]] for this reason, and is sometimes represented with her as Kubera Lakshmi.

While Kubera still enjoys prayers as the god of wealth, his role is largely taken by the god of wisdom, fortune and obstacle-removal, [[Ganesha]], with whom he is generally associated.&lt;ref name="knapp"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "williams"/&gt;

Kubera is recognized outside India and Hinduism as well. Kubera is a popular figure in Buddhist as well as Jain mythology.&lt;ref name = "Britannica"&gt;Kubera.(2010). In Encyclopædia Britannica.  Retrieved July 08, 2010, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324235/Kubera&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] Dr. Nagendra Kumar Singh remarked that, "Every [[Indian religion]] has a Kubera after the Hindu prototype".&lt;ref name="jain"/&gt;

=== Buddhism ===
{{see also|Jambhala|Vaiśravaṇa}}

Kubera is the Buddhist Vaiśravaṇa or Jambhala, and the Japanese Bishamon. The Buddhist Vaisravana, like the Hindu Kubera, is the regent of the North, a ''lokapala'' and the Lord of yakshas. He is one of the [[Four Heavenly Kings]], each associated with a cardinal direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaudhuri|first=Saroj Kumar|title=Hindu gods and goddesses in Japan  |year=2003|publisher=Vedams eBooks (P) Ltd|isbn=81-7936-009-1|chapter=Chapter 2: Vaisravana, the Heavenly King}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhist legends, Kubera is also equated with [[Pañcika]], whose wife [[Hariti]] is the symbol of abundance.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland pp. 63–4, 66&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography of Kubera and Pancika is so similar that in certain cases, A. Getty comments, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between Pancika and Kubera.&lt;ref name = "Thomas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donaldson|first=Thomas E. |title=Iconography of the Buddhist Sculpture of Orissa|year=2001|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=81-7017-406-6|pages=329–30|chapter=Jambhala/Pancika}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese Bishamon, also known as Tamon-Ten,&lt;ref name=biswas184/&gt; is one of the Jūni-Ten (十二天), a group of 12 Hindu deities adopted in Buddhism as guardian deities (''[[deva (Buddhism)|deva]]'' or ''ten'') who are found in or around Buddhist shrines. The Juni-Ten group of twelve deities were created by adding four deities to the older grouping of Happou-Ten, the eight guardians of the directions. Bishamon rules over the north, like his Hindu counterpart Kubera.&lt;ref name=biswas184&gt;S Biswas (2000), Art of Japan, Northern, {{ISBN|978-8172112691}}, page 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emuseum.jp/detail/100031/000/000?mode=detail&amp;d_lang=en Twelve Heavenly Deities (Devas)] Nara National Museum, Japan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Snodgrass]] (2007), The Symbolism of the Stupa, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807815}}, pages 120–124, 298–300&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Jainism ===
In Jainism, Kubera is the attendant yaksha of the 19th [[Tirthankar]] [[Mallinath]].&lt;ref name="jain"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Nagendra Kumar Singh|title=Encyclopaedia of Jainism|volume=1|year=2001|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. LTD.|isbn=81-261-0691-3|page=7280}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is usually called ''Sarvanubhuti'' or ''Sarvahna'', and may be depicted with four faces, rainbow colours and eight arms. The [[Digambara]] sect of Jainism gives him six weapons and three heads; while the [[Svetambara]]s portray him with four to six arms, numerous choices of weapons, though his attributes, the money bag and citron fruit are consistent. He may ride a man or an elephant.&lt;ref name="jain"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Jose"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pereira|first= José|title=Monolithic Jinas The Iconography of the Jain Temples of Ellora|year=1977|publisher=Motilal Banarsidas|isbn=0-8426-1027-8|pages=60–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is related to the Buddhist Jambhala rather than the Hindu Kubera.&lt;ref name = "Jose"/&gt;

'''Rudra''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ʊ|d|r|ə}}; {{lang-sa|रुद्र}}) is a [[Rigvedic deities|Rigvedic deity]] associated with [[Shiva]], the [[wind god|wind]] or [[weather god|storms]],{{sfnp|Basham|1989|p=15}} [[Vayu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rigveda, with Dayananda Saraswati's Commentary, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W3PXAAAAMAAJ|publisher=Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha|date=1974|page=717|quote=The third meaning of Rudra is Vayu or air that causes pain to the wicked on the account of their evil actions......

Depending upon the periodic situation, Rudra can mean 'the most severe roarer/howler' 
(could be a hurricane or tempest) or 'the most frightening one'. This name appears in the [[Shiva Sahasranama]], and R. K. Sharma notes that it is used as a name of [[Shiva]] often in later languages. The ''[[Shri Rudram]]'' hymn from the [[Yajurveda]] is dedicated to Rudra and is important in the [[Shaivism]] sect.&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1993_7174"&gt;For an overview of the Śatarudriya see: {{harvp|Kramrisch|1993|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=O5BanndcIgUC&amp;pg=PA71 pp. 71-4]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a full translation of the complete hymn see {{harvp|Sivaramamurti|2004|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=rOrilkdu-_MC&amp;pg=PA13 p. 13]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Prathama Anuvaka of Namakam ([[Yajurveda|Taittiriya Samhita]] 4.5), [[Shri Rudram|Sri Rudram]] the 'mightiest of the mighty' Rudra, is revered as ''[[Sadasiva]] (meaning 'mighty Shiva')'' and [[Shiva|Mahadeva]]. Sadashiva is the [[Supreme Being]], Lord [[Parameshwara (god)|Paramashiva]] in the Mantra marga [[Saiva Siddhanta|Siddhanta sect]] of [[Shaivism]]. Also, the name ''[[Shiva]]'' is used plenty of times in the same Anuvaka for invoking ''Rudra''.

==Etymology==
The [[etymology]] of the [[theonym]] ''Rudra'' is somewhat uncertain.&lt;ref name=Chakravarti1994_4&gt;{{harvp|Chakravarti|1994|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) root ''rud-'' (related to English ''rude''), which means 'to cry, howl'.{{r|Chakravarti1994_4}}{{sfnp|Kramrisch|1993|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=O5BanndcIgUC&amp;pg=PA5 p. 5]}} The name Rudra may thus be translated as 'the roarer'.{{sfnp|Majumdar|1951|p=162}} An alternative etymology suggested by Prof. Pischel interprets ''Rudra'' as the 'red one', the 'brilliant one', possibly derived from a lost root ''rud-'', 'red'{{sfnp|Griffith|1973|loc=p. 75, note 1}} or 'ruddy', or alternatively, according to Grassman, 'shining'.{{r|Chakravarti1994_4}}

Stella Kramrisch notes a different etymology connected with the adjectival form ''raudra'', which means 'wild', i.e., of ''rude'' (untamed) nature, and translates the name ''Rudra'' as 'the wild one' or 'the fierce god'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kramrisch|1993|p=5}} cites “rudra” in M. Mayrhofer, ''Concise Etymological Sanskrit Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt;  R. K. Śarmā follows this alternate etymology and translates the name as 'the terrible' in his glossary for the [[Shiva Sahasranama]].{{sfnp|Śarmā|1996|p=301}} [[J. P. Mallory|Mallory]] and [[Douglas Q. Adams|Adams]] also mention a [[Comparative mythology|comparison]] with the [[Old East Slavic|Old Russian]] deity Rŭglŭ to reconstruct a [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|Proto-Indo-European]] wild-god named ''*Rudlos'', though they remind that the issue of the etymology remains problematic: from PIE ''*reud-'' ('rend, tear apart'; cf. [[Latin]] ''rullus'', 'rustic'), or ''*reu-'' ('howl').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Mallory|first1=J. P.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iNUSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA433 |title=The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World|last2=Adams|first2=D. Q.|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929668-2|pages=434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commentator [[Sayana|{{IAST|Sāyaṇa}}]] suggests six possible derivations for ''rudra''.{{sfnp|Chakravarti|1994|p=5}} However, another reference states that Sayana suggested ten derivations.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Rudram and Purushasukram, by Swami Amiritananda, pp. 9-10, Sri Ramakrishna Math.&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective ''shivam'' in the sense of 'propitious' or 'kind' is applied to the name ''Rudra'' in [[Mandala 10|RV 10]].92.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kramrisch|1993|p=7}}. For the text of RV 10.92.9, see {{harvp|Arya|Joshi|2001|loc=vol. 4, p. 432}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudra is called 'the archer' (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|Śarva}}''){{sfnp|Apte|1965|p=910}} and the arrow is an essential attribute of Rudra.&lt;ref&gt;For archer and arrow associations, see {{harvp|Kramrisch|1993|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=O5BanndcIgUC&amp;pg=PA27 Chapter 2]}}; for the arrow as an "essential attribute" of Rudra, see {{harvp|Kramrisch|1993|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This name appears in the [[Shiva Sahasranama]], and R. K. Śarmā notes that it is used as a name of [[Shiva]] often in later languages.{{sfnp|Śarmā|1996|p=306}} The word is derived from the Sanskrit root ''{{IAST|śarv}}-'' which means 'to injure' or 'to kill',{{sfnp|Apte|1965|p=910}} and Śarmā uses that general sense in his interpretive translation of the name {{IAST|Śarva}} as 'One who can kill the forces of darkness'.{{sfnp|Śarmā|1996|p=306}} The names {{IAST|Dhanvin}} ('bowman'){{sfnp|Chidbhavananda|1997|p=33}} and {{IAST|Bāṇahasta}} ('archer', [[Literal translation|literally]] 'Armed with a hand-full of arrows'){{sfnp|Chidbhavananda|1997|p=33}}&lt;ref&gt;For translation of {{IAST|Bāṇahasta}} as “Armed with arrows in his hands”, see: {{harvp|Śarmā|1996|p=294}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also refer to archery.

In other contexts the word ''rudra'' can simply mean 'the number eleven'.{{sfnp|Apte|1965|p=804}} The word ''[[rudraksha]]'' (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|rudrākṣa}}'' = ''rudra'' and ''{{IAST|akṣa}}'' 'eye'), or 'eye of Rudra', is used as a name for both the berry of the [[Elaeocarpus ganitrus|Rudraksha tree]] and a name for a string of the prayer beads made from those seeds.{{sfnp|Apte|1965|p=804}}

Rudra is one of the names of [[Vishnu]] in [[Vishnu Sahasranama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nityananda Misra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e89eDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT248|title=The Om Mala: Meanings of the Mystic Sound|date=25 July 2018|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-9387471856|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adi Shankara]] in his commentary to [[Vishnu Sahasranama]] defined the name Rudra as 'One who makes all beings cry at the time of cosmic dissolution'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. M. Ninan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8RTZcjg9awC|title=The Development of Hinduism|date=23 June 2008|publisher=Madathil Mammen Ninan|isbn=978-1438228204|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author D. A. Desai in his glossary for the [[Vishnu Sahasranama]] says, Lord Vishnu in the form of Rudra is the one who does the total destruction at the time of great dissolution.&lt;ref name="D. A. Desai 1998 58"&gt;{{cite book|author=D. A. Desai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-1gpAAAAYAAJ|title=Shri Vishnu Sahasranama: In Sanskrit with Phonetics and Brief English Translation Explaining Its Grandeur and Procedural Rituals Etc|date=1998|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=58|quote=One who does this total destruction ( Pratardanah ) is the Lord in the form of Rudra at the time of great dissolution (Pralaya).}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is only the context known where Vishnu is revered as Rudra.

==Rigvedic hymns==
The earliest known mentions of the Vedic deity Rudra , occur in the [[Rigveda]], where three entire hymns are devoted to him.&lt;ref&gt;For the three Rigvedic hymns devoted to Rudra, see {{harvp|Chakravarti|1994|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For citation of the four Rigvedic hymns (1.43, 1.114, 2.33, and 7.46) see: {{harvp|Michaels|2004|pp=216, 364 note 50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are about seventy-five references to Rudra in the Rigveda overall.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Rudra is also included in a litany given in RV 7.40.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Form of Lord Rudra===
In the Rigveda we find verses which speak about the form of Rudra. Some of them are:
{{Blockquote|text=त्र्यम्बकं यजामहे tryambakaṃ yajāmahe ([[Mandala 7|RV 7]].59.12) -&gt; We worship the ''three eyed one''.}}
{{Blockquote|text=कपर्दिने kapardine ([[Mandala 1|RV 1]].114.1) -&gt; Who has ''matted hairs''}}
{{Blockquote|text=हिरण्यम् इव रोचते hiraṇyam iva rocate ([[Mandala 1|RV 1]].43.5) -&gt; Who ''shines like Gold''}}
{{Blockquote|text=शुक्र इव सूर्यो śukra iva sūryo ([[Mandala 1|RV 1]].43.5) -&gt; Who ''shines like Sun''}}
{{Blockquote|text=स्थीरेभिरंगै sthīrebhiraṃgai ([[Mandala 2|RV 2]].33.9) -&gt; Who is with ''firm limbs''}}
{{Blockquote|text=पुरुरुप pururupa ([[Mandala 2|RV 2]].33.9) -&gt; Who has ''multiforms''}}
{{Blockquote|text=यजतं विश्वरुपम् yajataṃ viśvarupam ([[Mandala 2|RV 2]].33.10) -&gt; Who is ''Vishwarupa'' (universe as form)}}
{{Blockquote|text=येभिः शिवः yebhiḥ śivaḥ ([[Mandala 10|RV 10]].92.9) -&gt; Who is ''Shiva'' (auspicious)}}

===Epithets of fierceness and fright===
In the Rigveda, Rudra's role as a frightening god is apparent in references to him as ''ghora'' ('extremely terrifying'), or simply as ''asau devam'' ('that god').{{sfnp|Flood|2003|p=73}} He is 'fierce like a terrific wild beast' (RV 2.33.11).{{sfnp|Arya|Joshi|2001|loc=vol. 2, p. 81}} Chakravarti sums up the perception of Rudra by saying: 'Rudra is thus regarded with a kind of cringing fear, as a deity whose wrath is to be deprecated and whose favor curried'.{{sfnp|Chakravarti|1994|p=8}}

RV 1.114 is an appeal to Rudra for mercy, where he is referred to as 'mighty Rudra, the god with braided hair'.{{sfnp|Doniger|1981|pp=224-5}}

In [[Mandala 7|RV 7]].46, Rudra is described as armed with a bow and fast-flying arrows, although many other weapons are known to exist. As quoted by R. G. Bhandarkar, the hymn declare that Rudra discharges 'brilliant shafts which run about the heaven and the earth' (RV 7.46.3), which may be a reference to lightning.&lt;ref name=Bhandarkar1995_146&gt;{{harvp|Bhandarkar|1995|p=146}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudra was believed to cure diseases, and when people recovered from them or were free of them, that too was attributed to the agency of Rudra.{{r|Bhandarkar1995_146}} He is asked not to afflict children with disease (RV 7.46.2) and to keep villages free of illness (RV 1.114.1). He is said to have healing remedies (RV 1.43.4), as the best physician of physicians (RV 2.33.4), and as possessed of a thousand medicines (RV 7.46.3). So he is described with an alternative name, '''Vaidyanatha''' (Lord of Remedies).

===Epithets of supreme rule===

{{clear|left}}

A verse from the Rig Veda ([[Mandala 2|RV 2]].33.9) calls Rudra 'The Lord or Sovereign of the Universe' (''īśānādasya bhuvanasya''):
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em; float:left;"&gt;
''sthirebhiraṅghaiḥ pururūpa ughro babhruḥ śukrebhiḥ pipiśehiraṇyaiḥ''
''īśānādasya bhuvanasya bhūrerna vā u yoṣad rudrādasuryam'' (RV 2.33.9)
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em; float:left;"&gt;
With firm limbs, multiform, the strong, the tawny adorns himself with bright gold decorations:
The strength of Godhead never departs from Rudra, him who is Sovereign of this world, the mighty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv02033.htm ''The Hymns of the Rig Veda,''] trans. [[Ralph T. H. Griffith]] (1896).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

{{clear|left}}

A verse of Śrī Rudram (= Yajurveda 16.18) speaks of Rudra as Lord of the Universe: &lt;br /&gt;
{{blockquote| '''जगताम् पतये नमः ।''' &lt;br /&gt;
''jagatăm pataye namaha'' । &lt;br /&gt;
Homage to the Lord of the Universe.}}

Another verse (Yajurveda 16.46) locates Rudra in the heart of the gods, showing that he is the inner Self of all, even the gods:&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/hin/wyv/wyvbk16.htm "The Texts of the White Yajurveda"], tr. [[Ralph T.H. Griffith]], [1899]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
{{blockquote| '''देवानां हृदयभ्यो नमो ।''' &lt;br /&gt;
''devănăm hridayebhyo namo'' &lt;br /&gt;
Salutations to him who is in heart of the gods.}}

In a verse popularly known as the [[Mahamrityunjaya Mantra]], both Rig Veda (7.59.12) and Yajur Veda (3.60) recommend worshipping Rudra to attain moksha (liberation):

{{blockquote| '''त्र्यम्बकं यजामहे सुगंधिं पुष्टिवर्धनम् उर्वारूकमिव बन्धनान् मृत्योर्मुक्षीय मा अमृतात।''' &lt;br /&gt;
{{IAST|''tryambakaṃ yajāmahe sugandhiṃ puṣṭivardhanam ''}}&lt;br /&gt;
{{IAST|''urvārukamiva bandhanān mṛtyormukṣīya mā'mṛtāt ''}}

We worship Tryambaka, sweet augmenter of prosperity. As from its stem a cucumber, may I be freed from the bonds of death, not reft of immortality.}}

In the Taittiriya Aranyaka of [[Yajur Veda]] (10.24.1),&lt;ref name=sanskritweb_net01&gt;{{cite web |editor=Subramania Sarma |title=Taittiriya Aranyaka |website=sanskritweb.net  |url=http://www.sanskritweb.net/yajurveda/ta-deva.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudra is identified as the universal existent ('all this') and thus as the [[Purusha]] (Supreme Person or inner Self) of the Vedas:

{{blockquote| 
{{IAST|''sarvo vai rudrastasmai rudrāya namo astu ''}}&lt;br /&gt;
{{IAST|''puruṣo vai rudraḥ sanmaho namo namaḥ ''}}&lt;br /&gt;
{{IAST|''viśvaṃ bhūtaṃ bhuvanaṃ citraṃ bahudhā jātaṃ jāyamānaṃ ca yat ''}}&lt;br /&gt;
{{IAST|''sarvo hyeṣa rudrastasmai rudrāya namo astu ॥ 1॥ ''}}

All this verily is Rudra. To Rudra who is such we offer our salutation. We salute again and again that Being, Rudra, who alone is the Purusha and the Soul of creatures. The material universe, the created beings, and whatever there is manifoldly and profusely created, in the past and in the present, in the form of the world—all that is indeed this Rudra. Salutations be to Rudra who is such. }}

The Taittiriya Aranyaka of [[Yajur Veda]] 1.10.1{{r|sanskritweb_net01}} identifies Rudra and [[Brihaspati]] as Sons and companions of Bhumi (Earth) and Heaven:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.srihayagrivan.org/ebooks/038_ap_v2.pdf|title=SriHayagrivan – AruNa praSnam, vol. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudra is used both as a name of Shiva and collectively ('the [[Rudras]]') as the name for the [[Maruts]].&lt;ref&gt;For the terms "Maruts" and "Rudras" as equivalent, see {{harvp|Flood|1996|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Maruts are 'storm gods' associated with the atmosphere.{{sfnp|Flood|1996|pp=45-6}} They are a group of gods whose number varies from two to sixty, sometimes also rendered as eleven, thirty-three{{sfnp|Macdonell|1996|p=256}} or a hundred and eighty in number (i. e., three times sixty. See RV 8.96.8.).

The Rudras are sometimes referred to as 'the sons of Rudra'{{sfnp|Flood|1996|p=46}} while Rudra is referred to as 'Father of the Maruts' (RV 2.33.1).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Arya|Joshi|2001|loc=vol. 2, p. 78}}. For Shiva as the head or father of the group see {{harvp|Apte|1965|p=804}}. For Rudra as the head of a host of "storm spirits, the Maruts" see: {{harvp|Basham|1989|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudra is mentioned along with a litany of other deities in [[Mandala 7|RV 7]].40.5. Here is the reference to Rudra, whose name appears as one of many gods who are called upon:

{{cquote|This ''{{IAST|Varuṇa}}'', the leader of the rite, and the royal ''Mitra'' and ''Aryaman'', uphold my acts, and the divine unopposed ''Aditi'', earnestly invoked: may they convey us safe beyond evil. I propitiate with oblations the ramifications ({{IAST|vayāḥ}}) of that divine attainable ''{{IAST|Viṣṇu}}'', the showerer of benefits. ''Rudra'', bestow upon us the magnificence of his nature.  The ''{{IAST|Aśvins}}'' have come down to our dwelling abounding with (sacrificial) food.&lt;ref&gt;RV 7.40.4–5 as translated in {{harvp|Arya|Joshi|2001|pp=243-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One scholiast's{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} interpretation of the Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|vayāḥ}}'', meaning 'ramifications' or 'branches', is that all other deities are, as it were, branches of [[Vishnu]],&lt;ref&gt;For the scholiast interpretation of ''{{IAST|vayāḥ}}'' as "ramifications" or "branches" see {{harvp|Arya|Joshi|2001|p=244}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but, Ralph T. H. Griffith cites Ludwig as saying, 'This [...] gives no satisfactory interpretation' and cites other views which suggest that the text is corrupt at that point.&lt;ref&gt;The citation continues as follows: "This, Ludwig remarks, gives no satisfactory interpretation; but I am unable to offer anything better at present. Grassman alters {{IAST|vayāḥ}} into {{IAST|vayāma}}: 'we with our offering approach the banquet of this swift-moving God, the bounteous {{IAST|Viṣṇu}}; i. e. come to offer him sacrificial food.'" in: {{harvp|Griffith|1973|loc=p. 356, note 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Rigvedic hymns==

In the various recensions of the [[Yajurveda]] is included a litany of stanzas praising Rudra: ''Maitrāyaṇī-Saṃhitā'' 2.9.2, ''Kāṭhaka-Saṃhitā'' 17.11, ''Taittirīya-Saṃhitā'' 4.5.1 and ''Vājasaneyi-Saṃhitā'' 16.1–14. This litany is subsequently referred to variously as the ''[[Rudram Chamakam|Śatarudriyam]]'' and the ''Namakam'' (because many of the verses commence with the word ''namaḥ'', meaning 'homage'), or simply the ''[[Rudram]]''. This litany was recited during the ''[[Agnicayana]]'' ritual ('the piling of Agni'), and it later became a standard element in Rudra liturgy.

A selection of these stanzas, augmented with others, is included in the ''Paippalāda-Saṃhitā'' of the [[Atharvaveda]] (PS 14.3–4). This selection, with further PS additions at the end, circulated more widely as the ''Nīlarudram'' (or ''Nīlarudra Upaniṣad'').{{r|Kramrisch1993_7174}}{{sfnp|Lubin|2007}}

The Hindu god [[Shiva]] shares several features with Rudra. The [[theonym]] ''Shiva'' originated as an epithet of Rudra and the adjective ''shiva'' ('kind') is used euphemistically of Rudra, who also carries the epithet ''Aghora, Abhayankar'' ('{{sic|extremely calm}} non terrifying').{{sfnp|Zimmer|1972|p=181}} Usage of the epithet ''shiva'' came to exceed the original theonym by the post-Vedic period (in the [[Sanskrit Epics]]), and the name ''Rudra'' has been taken as a synonym for the god Shiva to where the two names are used interchangeably.

===Shri Rudram===

The President of the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], at [[Chennai]], in commentating on the foreword to Swami Amritananda's translation of ''Sri Rudram and Purushasuktam'', states, 'Rudra to whom these prayers are addressed is not a sectarian deity, but the [[Supreme Being]] who is omnipresent and manifests Himself in myriad forms for the sake of the diverse spiritual aspirants'. [[Shri Rudram]] occurs in the fourth Kanda of the Taittiriya Samhita in the Yajurveda.
It is a preeminent Vedic hymn to [[Shiva]] as the God of dissolution and it is chanted daily in Shiva temples throughout India.&lt;ref&gt;Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/H4hLtzCeVds Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131124094612/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4hLtzCeVds&amp;gl=US&amp;hl=en Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4hLtzCeVds|title=SHRI RUDRAM FROM YAJURVEDA (Full)|last=Karthik Satchitanandam|date=9 July 2011|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prayer depicts the diverse aspects of the Almighty. The Shri Rudram hymn is unique in that it shows the presence of divinity throughout the entire universe. We cannot confine the qualities of the divine to those that are favourable to us. The Lord is both garden and graveyard, the slayer and the most benevolent one. The Almighty is impartial and ubiquitous.&lt;ref&gt;Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/vQjBQJqi0Ak Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140123024641/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQjBQJqi0Ak Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQjBQJqi0Ak|title=Sri Rudram|last=Vasudev R|date=1 January 2012|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hymn, Rudra is described as the most dreaded terroriser (frightening). Shri Rudram describes Rudra the Vedic deity as the personification of 'terror'. The name Rudra comes from ''ru'', meaning 'Roar or howl' (the words ''dreaded'' or ''fearsome'' could only be used as adjectives to Rudra and not as Rudra because Rudra is the personification of terror) and ''dra'', which is a superlative meaning 'the most'. So Rudra, depending on the poetic situation, can mean 'the most severe roarer/howler' or a hurricane or tempest or 'the most frightening one'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vedam Tutorials |website=Sri Sathya Sai Books &amp; Publication Trust |url=http://www.sssbpt.org/sri-rudram/instructions-to-user.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&amp;q=Rudra&amp;lang=sans&amp;action=Search|title=Sanskrit Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rudra and Shiva==

[[File:ThreeHeadedShivaGandhara2ndCentury.jpg|upright|thumb|Three-headed Shiva, [[Gandhara]], 2nd century AD]]
[[Shiva]] as known today shares many features with Rudra,{{sfnp|Michaels|2004|pp=316}} and Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in [[Hindu texts|Hindu scriptures]]. The two names are used synonymously. Rudra, the god of the roaring storm, is usually portrayed in accordance with the element he represents as a fierce, destructive deity.{{sfnp|Flood|2003|p=73}}

The oldest surviving text of Hinduism is the [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]], which is dated to between 1700 and 1100 BC based on [[Linguistics|linguistic]] and [[philology|philological]] evidence.&lt;ref&gt;For dating based on "cumulative evidence" see {{harvp|Oberlies|1998|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; A god named Rudra is mentioned in the Rig Veda. The name Rudra is still used as a name for Shiva. In RV 2.33, he is described as the 'Father of the [[Rudras]]', a group of storm gods.{{sfnp|Doniger|1981|pp=221–3}}

Hymn 10.92 of the Rigveda states that the deity Rudra has two natures, one wild and cruel (''rudra''), and another that is kind and tranquil (''shiva'').{{sfnp|Kramrisch|1993|p=7}} The Vedic texts do not mention a bull or any other animal as the vehicle (''vahana'') of Rudra or of any other deities. On the other hand, post-Vedic texts such as the Mahabharata and the Puranas mention [[Nandi (mythology)|Nandi]] the bull and the [[zebu]] as the vehicles of Rudra and of Shiva, thereby unmistakably linking them as the same.{{sfnp|Kramrisch|1993|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=O5BanndcIgUC&amp;pg=PA14 p. 14–5]}}
==In Buddhism==
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], according to the ''[[Orgyen Lingpa|Padma Thang Yig]]'', Rudra is a demon, formerly a human monk of noble origin named Koukuntri and then Tharpa Nakpo, who misunderstands dharma and engages in a life of vice and is condemned to [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Naraka]]. After 20.000 impure lives, he is eventually reborn as a demon in [[Sri Lanka]] by a prostitute who sleeps with three kinds of supernatural creatures, giving him three heads. His birth brings about plague and famine, so he is banished to a charnel ground, but he survives by devouring his mother's corpse and returns in order to conquer the world. Becoming the lover of the [[rakshasha]] queen Krodhishvari, he battles the gods, who are terrified of his extraordinary power and call the Buddhas and boddhisattvas for help.

The Buddha [[Vajrasattva]], who in a previous life was Tharpa Nakpo's master Thupka Zhonu, receives the mission to destroy Rudra, for which he is accompanied by Vajrapani, himself a reborn Pramadeva or Denphak, Nakpo's servant and fellow disciple. They both assume the wrathful forms [[Hayagriva (Buddhism)|Hayagriva]] and [[Vajravārāhī|Vajravarahi]], who challenge Rudra with nine dances and battle him. Hayagriva turns diminutive and enters Rudra's anus, after which becomes gigantic and destroys his body from inside out, submitting the demon and converting him as a dharma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew T. Kapstein|title=The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhism: Conversion, Contestation, and Memory|url=|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190288204|page=170-174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert A.

In another version, Hayagriva impersonates Rudra and sleeps with Krodishvari, and is reborn as the resultant child, [[Vajrakilaya|Vajrarakshasha]]. He takes over Rudra's realm and defeats him by plunging a three-pointed ''[[khaṭvāṅga]]'' into his chest. He then devours Rudra, purifies him in his stomach and excretes him as a protector of dharma, who hands over his army of demons to him as attendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Jacob P. Dalton|title=The Taming of the Demons: Violence and Liberation in Tibetan Buddhism|url=|year=2011|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300153927|page=184-190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art|author=John C.

==In Sikhism==
The 10th Sikh Guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]], describes the [[incarnation]] of Rudra in a composition titled '[[Rudra Avtar]]' in his book the [[Dasam Granth]].

'''Tvashtr''' ({{lang-sa|त्वष्टृ|Tvaṣṭṛ}}) or '''Tvashta''' ({{lang-sa|त्वष्टा|Tvaṣṭā}}) is a [[Vedic]] artisan god or fashioner. He is mentioned as an [[Adityas|Aditya]] (sons of goddess [[Aditi]]) in later Hindu scriptures like the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Puranas]]'', though his significance gets reduced. Tvashtr is sometimes identified with another artisan deity named [[Vishvakarma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dalal|first=Roshen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UCEoAwAAQBAJ&amp;q=vishvakarma+tvashtr&amp;pg=PT351|title=The Vedas: An Introduction to Hinduism's Sacred Texts|date=2014-04-15|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=978-81-8475-763-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hindu Literature==
In the ''[[Rigveda]]'', Tvashtr is stated to be a skillful craftsman who created many implements, including [[Indra|Indra's]] bolt, the axe of [[Brihaspati]], and a cup for divine food and drink. He is stated to be the creator of forms, and is often stated to be the crafter of living beings and wombs.  He is also considered a universal father, and an ancestor of humans through his daughter [[Saranyu]].&lt;ref name="md" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=De Witt Griswold|first1=Harvey|title=The Religion of the Rigveda|last2=Farquhar|first2=J. N.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1923|pages=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the father of [[Bṛhaspati]], and likely Indra's father as well.&lt;ref name="md"&gt;{{cite book|last=Macdonell|first=Arthur Anthony|title=Vedic Mythology|work=Encyclopedia of Indo-Aryan Research|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1897|isbn=|editor-last=Bühler|editor-first=G.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/vedicmythology00macd/page/116 116–118]|chapter=Abstract Gods|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/vedicmythology00macd/page/116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He wields a metal axe,{{Sfn|Jamison|Brereton|2014|p=1090}}&lt;ref name="md" /&gt; and rides a chariot pulled by two fallow bay [[Mare|mares]].&lt;ref name="md" /&gt;{{Sfn|Jamison|Brereton|2014|p=837}} 

He is the guardian of [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], and his son Vishvarupa is the guardian of cows. Indra has a conflict with his likely father Tvashtr, with him stealing Tvashtr's soma and trying to possess Vishvarupa’s cattle. Indra is consistently victorious in the conflict, and Tvashtr is stated to fear Indra. In the [[Taittiriya Samhita]] and [[Brahmana|Brahmanas]], Vishvarupa is killed by Indra, and so Tvashtr does not allow Indra to attend his Soma sacrifice. Indra however, steals and drinks the soma through his strength.&lt;ref name="md" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephanie Jamison|url=|title=The Rigveda –– Earliest Religious Poetry of India|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0190633394|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to have revenge for the murder of his son Vishvarupa, Tvashtr creates a demon called [[Vritra]]. However when wishing him into existence, Tvashtr makes a mispronunciation in his incantation, which allows Indra to defeat Vritra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Jamison|first1=S. W.|last2=Witzel|first2=M.|date=1992|title=Vedic Hinduism|url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/vedica.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mānava Purana, he took rebirth as Arjuna's son,  [[Babhruvahana]].

Tvashtr is associated with many other deities, [[Pushan]], [[Savitr]], [[Dhatri|Dhatr]], [[Prajapati]], and [[Vishvakarman]], due to his role as a fashioner.&lt;ref name="md" /&gt;

'''Pushan''' ({{lang-sa|[[wiktionary:पूषन्|पूषन्]]|Pūṣan}}) is a [[Hindu]] [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] [[solar deity]] and one of the [[Adityas]]. He is the god of meeting. Pushan is responsible for marriages, journeys, roads, and the feeding of cattle. He was a [[psychopomp]] (soul guide), conducting souls to the other world. He protected travelers from bandits and wild beasts, and protected men from being exploited by other men. He was a supportive guide, a "good" god, leading his adherents towards rich pastures and wealth.

==Etymology==
Traditionally, the name of the deity is said to be derived from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] verb, ''pūṣyati'', which means "to cause to thrive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macdonell|first1=Arthur Anthony|title=A Vedic Reader for Students|date=1917|publisher=Clarendon Press (Oxford)|location=Oxford, England|pages=[https://archive.org/details/vedicreaderforst00macd/page/111 111]–115|url=https://archive.org/details/vedicreaderforst00macd|access-date=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern scholars consider Pushan to be derived from the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European god]] ''*Péh₂usōn'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallory|first1=J. P.|last2=Adams|first2=D. Q.|title=The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-19-929668-2|page=434}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would thereby make Pushan a [[cognate]] of the [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek god]] [[Pan (deity)|Pan]]. The connection between Pan and Pushan was first proposed by the German scholar Hermann Collitz in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;H. Collitz, "Wodan, Hermes und Pushan," Festskrift tillägnad Hugo Pipping pȧ hans sextioȧrsdag den 5 November 1924 1924, pp 574–587.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==
Ten hymns in the [[Rigveda]] are dedicated to Pūṣan (including one jointly to Soma and Pūṣan and another to Indra and Pūṣan).&lt;ref&gt;''Rigveda'' [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv01042.htm I.42], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv01138.htm I.138], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv02040.htm II.40] (to Soma and Pūṣan), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv06053.htm VI.53], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv06054.htm VI.54], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv06055.htm VI.55], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv06056.htm VI.56], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv06057.htm VI.57] (to Indra and Pūṣan), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv06058.htm VI.58] and [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10026.htm X.26].

He seems to represent the sun as a guardian of flocks and herds. Pushan is also regarded as Kavi, who in turn became an epithet of a number of gods and further a title signifying "king".

He has braided hair and a beard, and carries a golden [[axe]], an [[wikt:awl|awl]], and a [[goad]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jamison|first=Stephanie|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Rigveda_3_Volume_Set/fgzVAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0|title=The Rigveda –– Earliest Religious Poetry of India|last2=Brereton|first2=Joel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0190633394|location=|pages=151, 849–850}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Macdonell|first=Arthur Anthony|title=Vedic Mythology|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1897|pages=35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eats gruel, and in the [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] is stated to be toothless. He is married to Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun, whom the gods bestowed on him. He is a knower of paths and a guardian of roads.&lt;ref name = "Dalal14" /&gt; In this role he protects people from various dangers on roads, such as wolves and ambushers. He is also associated with divine paths, and is familiar with the path between earth and heaven, which allows him lead souls to heaven.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He is invoked to guard cattle, horses, and sheep, and is asked to find those cattle that have been lost.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to a narrative found in the [[Taittiriya Samhita]], [[Rudra]] was excluded from the [[Daksha yajna]], an important sacrifice in honor of various deities. He, in anger, pierced the sacrifice with an arrow and Pushan broke his teeth as he attempted to eat a part of the oblation. The later versions of this narrative are found in the [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]], and the [[Puranas]]. In these versions, [[Rudra]] (or [[Shiva]]) was angry because his father-in-law, [[Daksha]], the sacrificer, did not invite him. [[Shiva]], in anger, kicked Pushan and knocked out his teeth as he was eating the oblation.&lt;ref name="dowson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dowson |first=John |title=A Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology and Religion, Geography, History, and Literature |publisher= Trübner &amp; Co. |location=London |year=1888 |edition=2nd |pages=[https://archive.org/details/aclassicaldictio00dowsuoft/page/n294 249]–250 |url=https://archive.org/details/aclassicaldictio00dowsuoft |quote=Pushan + Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology and Religion, Geography, History and John Dowson. | isbn=978-0-7661-7589-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Puranic]] versions, [[Virabhadra]], created by [[Shiva]] from a lock of his matted hair, knocked out Pushan's teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilkins |first=W.J. |title=Hindu Mythology, Vedic, and Puranic |publisher=Thacker, Spink &amp; Co. |location=Calcutta |year=1900 |edition=2nd |page=270 |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/hmvp/hmvp33.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Mahabharata'' and ''Puranas'', Pushan is described as one of the twelve ''Adityas'' ([[Aditi]]'s sons). Aditi's other eleven sons as listed in the Mahabharata are [[Surya]], [[Aryaman]], [[Tvashta]], [[Savitr]], [[Bhaga]], [[Dhatri|Dhata]], [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]], [[Varuna]], [[Amsha]], [[Indra]] and [[Vishnu]] (in the form of [[Vamana]]deva).&lt;ref name = "Dalal14"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dalal|first=Roshen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrk0AwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Pushan|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|date=2014-04-18|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=978-81-8475-277-9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Rigveda]], Aryaman is described as the protector of mares and stallions, and the [[Milky Way]] (aryamṇáḥ pánthāḥ) is said to be his path.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Balarama''' ([[Sanskrit]]: बलराम, [[IAST]]: ''Balarāma'') is a [[Hindu god]] and the elder brother of [[Krishna]]. He is particularly significant in the [[Jagannath]] tradition, as one of the triad deities.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p82"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC |year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3179-8|pages=82–84, 269}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known as '''Haladhara''', '''Halayudha''', '''Baladeva''', '''Balabhadra''', and '''Sankarshana'''.

The first two epithets associate him with ''hala'' (''langala'', "plough")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Gonda|author-link=Jan Gonda|title=Aspects of Early Viṣṇuism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8urRsuUJ9oC |year=1969|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1087-7|pages=100, 152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; from his strong associations with farming and farmers, as the deity who used farm equipment as weapons when needed, and the next two refer to his strength.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p82"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lavanya Vemsani|title=Hindu and Mythology of Balarāma |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RXnXAAAAMAAJ |year=2006|location=[[Lewiston, New York]] |publisher=[[Edwin Mellen Press]]|isbn=978-0-7734-5723-2|pages=30–31, 52–59, 68–69 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balarama is sometimes described as incarnation of [[Shesha]], the serpent associated with the deity [[Vishnu]]; Krishna is regarded as an incarnation of Vishnu. Some traditions regard him as one of the [[Dashavatara|10 principal avatars]] of Vishnu himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Balarama|title=Balarama &amp;#124; Hindu mythology|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p82"/&gt;

Balarama's significance in Indian culture has ancient roots. His image in artwork is dated to around the start of the common era, and in coins dated to the second-century BCE.&lt;ref name="Elgood2000p57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heather Elgood|title=Hinduism and the Religious Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cj2tAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61|date=1 April 2000|publisher=Bloomsburg Academic|isbn=978-0-304-70739-3|pages=57, 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jainism, he is known as Baladeva, and has been a historically significant farmer-related deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vemsani|first1=Lavanya|title=Hindu and Jain Mythology of Balarama|date=2006|location=[[Lewiston, New York]]|publisher=[[Edwin Mellen Press]]|isbn=9780773457232|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=olivelle391&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Olivelle|title=Between the Empires: Society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efaOR_-YsIcC&amp;pg=PA391|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-977507-1|pages=391 with note 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balarama is an ancient deity, a prominent one by the epics era of Indian history as evidenced by archeological and numismatic evidence. His iconography appears with [[Nāga]] (many-headed serpent), a plough and other farm artifacts such as a watering pot, possibly indicating his origins in a bucolic, agricultural culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth W. Morgan|title=The Religion of the Hindus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ulz9mO9cK54C |year=1987|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0387-9|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balarama's legend appears in many ''Parva'' (books) of the ''[[Mahabharata]]''. The Book Three ([[Vana Parva]]) states about Krishna and him that Balarama is an avatar of Vishnu, while Krishna is the source of all avatars and existence. In some art works of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], temples of Gujarat and elsewhere, for example, Baladeva is the eighth avatar of Vishnu, prior to the [[Buddha]] (Buddhism) or [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]] (Jainism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6 |page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth W.

===Texts===

Narratives of Balarama are found in ''[[Mahabharata]]'', ''[[Harivamsha]]'', ''[[Bhagavata Purana]],'' and other [[Puranas]]. He is identified with the [[vyuha]] avatar of [[Saṃkarṣaṇa|Sankarshana]], along with the deities of [[Shesha]] and [[Lakshmana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimad-Bhagavatam: Bhagavata Purana|isbn=0892132507|author=A.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|editor=Bhaktivedanta Book Trust|year=1987}}&lt;!--|access-date=29 July 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The legend of Balarama as the avatar of Shesha, the demigod-serpent Vishnu rests upon, reflects his role and association with Vishnu.&lt;ref name=" JonesRyan2006p65"/&gt; However, Balarama's mythology and his association with the ten avatars of Vishnu is relatively younger and post-Vedic, because it is not found in the Vedic texts.&lt;ref&gt;Padmanabh S. Jaini (1977), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/615287 Jina Ṛṣabha as an "Avatāra" of Viṣṇu], ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', Cambridge University Press, Vol. 40, No. 2 (1977), pp. 321–337&lt;/ref&gt;

Balarama finds a mention in Kautilya's [[Arthashastra]] (4th to 2nd century BCE), where according to Hudson, his followers are described as "ascetic worshippers" with shaved heads or braided hair.&lt;ref name="Hudson2008p99"/&gt;

Balarama, as Baladewa, is an important character in the 11th-century Javanese text ''[[Kakawin Bhāratayuddha]]'', the Kakawin poem based on the ''Mahabharata''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Creese|title=Women of the Kakawin World: Marriage and Sexuality in the Indic Courts of Java and Bali|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZ1sBgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-45179-2|pages=93, 104–105, 110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins dated to about 185-170 BCE belonging to the Indo-Greek King [[Agathocles of Bactria|Agathocles]] show Balarama's iconography and Greek inscriptions. Balarama-Samkarshana is typically shown standing with a gada in his right hand and holding a plough in his left. On the other side of these coins is [[Vāsudeva-Krishna]] holding the conch and chakra.

At [[Chilas]] II archeological site dated to the first half of 1st-century CE in northwest Pakistan, near Afghanistan border, are engraved two males along with many Buddhist images nearby. The larger of the two males hold a plough and club in his two hands.

In all of these early depictions, Balarama-Samkarsana seems to hold a senior position over Vāsudeva-Krishna.&lt;ref name=" DS215"/&gt; On the coins of [[Agathocles of Bactria]], Balarama is on the front of the coin (the side with a legend in Greek), whereas Vāsudeva-Krishna is on the reverse ([[Brahmi]] side).&lt;ref name=" DS215"/&gt; At Chilas, Balarama is shown taller and bigger than Vāsudeva-Krishna.&lt;ref name=" DS215"/&gt; The same relationship is also visible in the hierarchy of the Vrishni heroes.&lt;ref name="DS215"/&gt;

[[File:Krishna meets parents.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Krishna]] and Balarama meet their parents. 19th-century painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]]]
Balarama was the son of [[Vasudeva]]. The evil king [[Kamsa]], the tyrant of [[Mathura]], was intent upon killing the children of his cousin, [[Devaki]], because of a prophecy that he would die at the hands of her eighth child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dalal |first=Roshen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrk0AwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=kamsa+cousin+devaki&amp;pg=PT632 |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |date=2014-04-18 |publisher=Penguin UK |isbn=978-81-8475-277-9 |pages=632 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Harivamsa|Harivamsha]] states that Kamsa went on to murder the first six children of the imprisoned Devaki by smashing the newborns against a stone floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U26fDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=kamsa+smashed+newborns&amp;pg=PA156 |title=Krishna's Lineage: The Harivamsha of Vyasa's Mahabharata |date=2019-07-02 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-027919-6 |pages=156 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishnu intervened and when Balarama was conceived, state the Hindu legends; his embryo was transferred from Devaki's womb into the womb of [[Rohini Devi|Rohini]], Vasudeva's first wife.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p65"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth W.

Balarama grew up with his younger brother Krishna with his foster-parents, in the household of the head of cowherds [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]], and his wife, [[Yashoda]].&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p82"/&gt; The chapter 10 of the Bhagavata Purana describes it as follows:

{{Blockquote|
The Bhagavan as the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Self]] of everything tells the creative power of His unified consciousness (yogamaya) about His plan for His own birth as Balarama and Krishna.

He was named Rama, but because of his great strength, he was called Balarama, Baladeva, or Balabhadra, meaning ''Strong Rama''.

One day, Nanda requested the presence of Sage [[Gargamuni]], his priest, to name the newborn [[Krishna]] and Balarama. When the Garga arrived, Nanda received him well and requested the naming ceremony. Gargamuni then reminded Nanda that Kamsa was looking for the son of Devaki and if he performed the ceremony in opulence, it would come to his attention. Nanda, therefore, asked Garga to perform the ceremony in secret and Garga did so:

Balarama spent his childhood as a cow herder with his brother Krishna. He killed [[Dhenuka]], an [[Asura (Hinduism)|asura]] sent by Kamsa, as well as [[Pralamba]] and Mushtika wrestlers sent by the king. When Krishna was killing Kamsa, Balarama slew his mighty commander, [[List of characters in the Mahabharata#Kaalvakra|Kalavakra]]. After the evil king was slain, Balarama and Krishna went to the ashrama of sage [[Sandipani]] at [[Ujjain]] for their education. Balarama married [[Revati]], the daughter of King [[Kakudmi]].&lt;ref name=pargiter135&gt;Pargiter, F.E. (1922, reprint 1972). ''Ancient Indian Historical Tradition'', New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; He had two sons - Nishatha and Ulmuka, and a daughter - Vatsala/Shashirekha.

Balarama is the celebrated tiller, one of the embodiments of agriculture along with livestock with whom Krishna is associated with. The plough is Balarama's weapon. In the ''Bhagavata Purana'', he uses it to fight asuras, dig a way for [[Yamuna]] river to bring it closer to [[Vrindavan]], and he also availed it to drag the entire capital of [[Hastinapura]] into the Ganga river.&lt;ref name="Hudson2008p99"&gt;{{cite book|author=D Dennis Hudson|title=The Body of God: An Emperor's Palace for Krishna in Eighth-Century Kanchipuram|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMCxbOezDi4C |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-970902-1|pages=97–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kurukshetra War ===

Balarama taught both [[Duryodhana]] of the Kauravas and [[Bhima]] of the Pandavas the art of war with a [[Gada (mace)|mace]]. When war broke between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, Balarama carried obligations for both sides and so remained neutral. He went for a pilgrimage with his nephew [[Pradyumna]] and other Yadavas during the war, and returned on the last day, to watch the fight between his disciples. When Bhima defeated Duryodhana by striking him in the thigh with his mace, a traditional violation of the rules of combat, Balarama threatened to kill Bhima. This was prevented when Krishna reminded Balarama of the vow of Bhima—to kill Duryodhana by crushing the thigh he had exposed to Bhima's wife, [[Draupadi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Varkey|first=C.P.|title=A Pilgrimage Through The Mahabharata|year=2001|publisher=St. Paul Society|location=Mumbai|isbn=81-7109-497-X|pages=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disappearance===
[[File:Death of Bala Rama.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Balarama ascends to heaven.]]

In the [[Bhagavata Purana]], it is described that after Balarama took part in the battle causing the destruction of the remainder of the [[Yadu dynasty]] and witnessing the disappearance of Krishna, he sat down in a meditative state and departed from this world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/11/30/26/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326075600/http://vedabase.net/sb/11/30/26/en1|url-status=dead|title=ŚB 11.30.26|archive-date=26 March 2007|website=vedabase.io}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scriptures describe a great white snake that left the mouth of Balarama, in reference to his identity as Ananta-[[Sesha]], a form of Vishnu. The place where he departed is situated near [[Somnath Temple]] in [[Gujarat]].

The local people of [[Veraval]] believe about the cave near the temple place, that the white snake who came out of Balarama's mouth got into that cave and went back to [[Patala]]''.''

===Significance===

In Hindu tradition, Balarama is depicted as a farmer's patron deity, signifying the one who is "harbinger of knowledge", of agricultural tools and prosperity.&lt;ref name=" Vemsani2016p23"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lavanya Vemsani |title=Krishna in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Hindu Lord of Many Names |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4fw2DAAAQBAJ |year= 2016|publisher =ABC-CLIO|isbn= 978-1-61069-211-3|pages= 23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is almost always shown and described with Krishna, such as in the act of stealing butter, playing childhood pranks, complaining to Yashoda that his baby brother Krishna had eaten dirt, playing in cow sheds, studying together at the school of [[guru]] [[Sandipani]], and fighting malevolent beasts sent by Kamsa to kill the two brothers.&lt;ref name="Vemsani2016p23"/&gt; He is the constant companion of Krishna, ever watchful, leading to the epithet ''"Luk Luk Dauji"'' (or ''Luk Luk Daubaba'') in the [[Pushtimarg|Pustimarga]] tradition of [[Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref name="Vemsani2016p23"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

In Hindu texts, Balarama almost always supports Krishna in form and spirit. However, there are occasions where the dialogues between Balarama and Krishna present different viewpoints, with Krishna's wisdom establishing him to be the ultimate divinity.&lt;ref name="Vemsani2016p23"/&gt; Balarama's constant symbolic association with Krishna makes him the protector and supporter of [[dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lavanya Vemsani |title=Krishna in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Hindu Lord of Many Names |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4fw2DAAAQBAJ  |year=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-211-3|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===

The [[Jain]] [[Puranas]], notably, the ''Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacarita'' of [[Hemachandra]], narrate hagiographical accounts of nine Baladevas or [[Balabhadra]]s who are believed to be [[śalākāpuruṣa]]s (literally torch-bearers, great personalities). Balarama was the ninth one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Iconography of Balarāma | publisher=Abhinav Publications | author=Joshi, Nilakanth Purushottam | year=1979 | location=New Delhi | isbn=81-7017-107-5}}, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Balarama along with Krishna are considered as cousins of the revered [[Tirthankara]] [[Neminatha]] (Aristanemi) by Jains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Umakant Premanand Shah|title=Studies in Jaina Art and Iconography and Allied Subjects |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fETebHcHKogC |year =1995|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-316-8|pages=75–76}}, Quote: "Krsna (Vasudeva) and Baladeva or Balarama are regarded as cousin brothers of Neminatha".&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jainism tradition lists 63 ''Śalākāpuruṣa'' or notable figures which, amongst others, includes the twenty-four ''Tirthankaras'' and nine sets of triads. One of these triads is Krishna as the ''Vasudeva'', Balarama as the ''Baladeva'', and [[Jarasandha]] as the ''Prati-Vasudeva''. In each age of the Jain cyclic time is born a ''Vasudeva'' with an elder brother termed the ''Baladeva''.  Between the triads, ''Baladeva'' upholds the principle of non-violence, a central idea of Jainism. The villain is the ''Prati-vasudeva'', who attempts to destroy the world. To save the world, ''Vasudeva-Krishna'' has to forsake the non-violence principle and kill the ''Prati-Vasudeva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Jaini|first=P.

[[File:Khajuraho22.jpg|thumb|Balarama with a plough in his left hand, at the [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho]] Parsvnatha Jain Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Devangana Desai|title=Khajuraho|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amPqAAAAMAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-565391-5|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The story of Krishna's life in the ''Puranas'' of Jainism follows the same general outline as those in the Hindu texts, but in details, they are very different: they include Jain ''Tirthankaras'' as characters in the story, and generally are polemically critical of Krishna, unlike the versions found in the ''Mahabharata'', the ''Bhagavata Purana'', and the ''Vishnu Purana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Cort| first=J. E.|date=1993|editor=Wendy Doniger|title=An Overview of the Jaina Puranas, in Purana Perennis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kZFzHCuiFAC&amp;pg=PA191 |pages=220–233 |isbn=9781438401362}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Krishna loses battles in the Jain versions, and his ''gopis'' and his clan of Yadavas die in a fire created by an ascetic named Dvaipayana. Similarly, after dying from the hunter Jara's arrow, the Jaina texts state Krishna goes to the [[Naraka (Jainism)|third hell]] in [[Jain cosmology]], while Balarama is said to go to the [[Svarga (Jainism)|sixth heaven]].&lt;ref name="Glasenapp1999p317"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helmuth von Glasenapp|title=Jainism: An Indian Religion of Salvation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzEzXDk0v6sC&amp;pg=PA317 |year=1999|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1376-2|pages=316–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other Jain texts, Krishna and Baladeva are stated to be a cousin of the twenty-second ''Tirthankara'', Neminatha. The Jain texts state that Naminatha taught Krishna all the wisdom that he later gave to Arjuna in the ''Bhagavad Gita''. According to [[Jeffery D. Long]], a professor of Religion known for his publications on Jainism, this connection between Krishna and Neminatha has been a historic reason for Jains to accept, read, and cite the ''Bhagavad Gita'' as a spiritually important text, celebrate Krishna-related festivals, and intermingle with Hindus as spiritual cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D.

Evidence related to early Jainism, states [[Patrick Olivelle]] and other scholars, suggests Balarama had been a significant farmer deity in Jain tradition in parts of the Indian subcontinent such as near the Mathura region.&lt;ref name=olivelle391/&gt; Jain texts such as the ''[[Kalpa Sūtra|Kalpasutra]]'' describe the same idea of embryo transfer, as in Hindu texts for Balarama, for the 24th Tirthankara [[Mahavira]]; in the latter case, the embryo of a Brahmin woman is moved into the womb of a Kshatriya woman.&lt;ref name="Pal1997p25"/&gt; Balarama, states [[Pratapaditya Pal]], was one of the historic deities revered in Jainism along with Ambika, Lakshmi and others.&lt;ref name="Pal1997p25"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pratapaditya Pal|title=Divine Images, Human Visions: The Max Tanenbaum Collection of South Asian and Himalayan Art in the National Gallery of Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PMUp4nxAqwwC&amp;pg=PA25 |year=1997 |publisher=National Gallery of Canada |isbn=978-1-896209-05-0| pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=MNP Tiwari|editor=Umakant Premanand Shah|title=Studies in Jaina Art and Iconography and Allied Subjects in Honour of Dr. U.P.

===Buddhism===
Balarama images have been discovered in central Indian Buddhist sites, such as with Sanchi stupas at Andher, Mehgaon and Chandna. These are dated to around the start of the common era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Julia Shaw|title=Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, c.

In the [[Puranas]], Shesha is said to hold all the planets of the universe on his hoods and to constantly sing the glories of [[Vishnu]] from all his mouths. He is sometimes referred to as '''Ananta Shesha''', "Endless-Shesha", or '''Adishesha,''' the "First Shesha". It is said that when Adishesa uncoils, time moves forward and creation takes place; when he coils back, the universe ceases to exist.

The [[Narayana]] form of Vishnu is often depicted as resting on Shesha, accompanied by his consort [[Lakshmi]]. Adishesha is considered as one of the two mounts of Vishnu alongside [[Garuda]]. He is said to have descended upon Earth in the following human forms or incarnations: [[Lakshmana]], brother of Vishnu's incarnation [[Rama]] during the [[Treta Yuga]], and according to some traditions, as [[Balarama]], brother of Vishnu's incarnation [[Krishna]] during the [[Dvapara Yuga]]. According to the [[Mahabharata]] (Adi Parva), his father was [[Kashyapa]] and his mother [[Kadru]], though in other accounts, he is usually a primordial being created by Vishnu. 

His name means "he who remains", from the [[Sanskrit]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''śiṣ'', because even as the world is destroyed at the end of each [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]], Shesha remains as he is.

Adishesha is generally depicted with a massive form that floats coiled through space, or upon the [[Kshir Sagar|Ocean of Milk]], to form the bed upon which Vishnu lays. Sometimes, he is depicted as a five-headed or seven-headed or a ten-headed [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]; but more commonly as one thousand-headed, or five thousand-headed, or even as many as a one million-headed [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]; sometimes with each head wearing an ornate crown.

== Origin ==
According to the [[Mahabharata]], Adishesha was born to the sage [[Kashyapa]] and his wife [[Kadru]]. Kadru gave birth to a thousand snakes, of which Shesha was the eldest. After Shesha, [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], [[Iravati]] and [[Takshaka]] were born, in that order. A lot of Shesha's brothers were cruel and were bent upon inflicting harm on others. They were even unkind to [[Garuda]], who was Kashyapa's son through [[Vinata]], sister of Kadru. (Kadru and Vinata were daughters of Daksha).

Shesha, disgusted by the cruel acts of his brothers, left his mother and kin, and took to austere penances. He lived on air and meditated in places including Gandhamadhana, Badrikashrama, Gokarna, Pushkara, and the [[Himalayas]]. His penances were so severe that his flesh, skin, and muscles dried up and merged with his frame. [[Brahma]], convinced of Shesha's will, asked Shesha to request a boon. Shesha asked that he be able to keep his mind under control so that he could continue to perform ascetic penances. Brahma gladly accepted the request. [[Brahma]] then asked a favour of Shesha: to go beneath the precarious earth and stabilise it. Shesha agreed and went to the netherworld and stabilised [[Bhumi (goddess)|Bhumi]] with his hood. He is believed to support her even today, thus making [[Patala]] his perennial residence.&lt;ref&gt;''Mbh'', Adi Parva&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahavishnu and Sankarshana===

Shesha is usually depicted as floating in the ocean of the changing world, forming the bed of [[Mahavishnu]].

In the [[Bhagavata Purana]], Shesha is named '''Sankarshana''', the [[tamasic]] energy of [[Narayana]] himself, and is said to live deep within the inner layers of [[Patala]], where there are many serpents with gems on their heads and where he reigns as its ruler. He is said to have existed before the creation of the universe. When the universe is towards its end, he creates the 11 [[Rudras]] from the serpents to destroy the universe for a new one to be created.

Sankarshana is also one of the four [[vyuha]] forms of [[Vishnu]], the other three being [[Vāsudeva]], [[Pradyumna]], and [[Aniruddha]].

In [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya]] accounts, Sankarshana expands himself as Garbhodakshayi-Vishnu in the beginning of the universe to create [[Brahma]]. In other words, Sankarshana is believed to be Narayana himself.

In the first few chapters of the [[Purana|Puranas]], it is also said that Sankarshana preached the [[Bhagavata]] to the [[Four Kumaras]], who in turn passed on this message. At some point, the message was passed to sage [[Maitreya]], who in turn preached it to [[Vidura]].

Adisesha is believed to have taken 6 incarnations on earth. During the [[Satya Yuga]], he came down in his original form to form a seat for Vishnu's avatar of [[Narasimha]], who had incarnated to slay the impious [[Hiranyakashipu]].

During the [[Treta Yuga]], Sesha took birth as [[Lakshmana]], as Lord Vishnu's (as [[Rama]]) brother. Lakshmana is a very prominent character in the Ramayana, along with Hanuman and Sita.

During [[Dvapara Yuga]], he is a stated to have incarnated as [[Balarama]] again as a brother to Vishnu (as Krishna). This is often disputed by the original line-ups of the [[Dashavatara|Dasavatara]], where Balarama is also considered to be an incarnation of Vishnu. 

During the [[Kali Yuga]], according to [[Sri Vaishnavism|Sri Vaishnava]] tradition, he was born as [[Patanjali|Patanjali Maharishi]], [[Ramanuja|Ramanujacharya]], and [[Manavala Mamunigal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Manavala Mamunigal |url=http://acharya.org/ac/smm/smmv7.html |access-date=2022-06-07 |website=acharya.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not accompanied by [[Vishnu|God]] during the Kali Yuga. Instead, he incarnated alone to spread devotion among the people, being a peaceful incarnation.

[[Sri Vaishnavism]] also states that Balarama is an incarnation of both [[Vishnu]] and Adishesha. In the [[Bhagavad-Gita|Bhagavad Gita]], in the middle of the battlefield [[Kurukshetra]], Krishna, explaining his omnipresence, says: "Of [[Nāga]]s, I am Ananta" indicating the importance of Ananta Shesha.

==Literature==
The [[Brahma Purana]] describes the attributes of Ananta:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2018-03-17 |title=The Magnitude of Netherworlds [Chapter 19] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/brahma-purana-english/d/doc216089.html |access-date=2022-08-13 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the welfare of the universe, he deprives the Asuras of their prowess. His eyes whirl and rove due to intoxication. He has only one earring at all times.

Wearing a crown and garlands he shines like a white mountain aflame with fire.

He is clad in blue garments. He is intoxicated with pride. He is resplendent with white garlands. He is lofty like the mountain of Kailāsa where the celestial Gaṅgā falls. He has placed his hand on the plough-share; he holds an excellent iron club. He is attended upon by the embodied splendour of Varuṇa.

He holds the entire sphere of the world rising above like a peak.|title=[[Brahma Purana]]|source=Chapter 19}}
The Brahmanda Purana also described Shesha in Patala:
{{Blockquote|text=With his two thousand eyes that have the reddish splendour of the rising sun and with his body that is white and glossy, he appears like the mountain. Kailāsa surrounded by clusters of flames. He has the white complexion like the Moon as well as the Kunda flowers.

He has a huge terrible body. With it (resting) in his reclining pose on his couch, he appears like a thousand-peaked mountain of vast dimensions (resting) over the earth.

This (enormously) huge lord of serpents, himself of great splendour, is being attended upon by extremely wise and noble-souled great serpents of huge physique. He is the king of all serpents. He is Ananta, Śeṣa, of excessive brilliance.|title=[[Brahmanda Purana]]|source=Chapter 20}}[[File:Vishnu with Shesha Naga - Bronze - Showcase 11-1 - Bronze Gallery - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 6635.JPG|thumb|Vishnu with Shesha Naga-ancient Bronze artefact in Government Museum Mathura]]The [[Bhagavata Purana]] equates Shesha and Balarama:

{{more citations needed|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Khajuraho ni05-11.jpg|thumb|Parshvanatha Temple, Khajuraho, the southeast corner, with guardians Indra (E) and Agni (SE).]]The '''Guardians of the Directions''' ([[Sanskrit]]: दिक्पाल, '''Dikpāla''') are the deities who rule the specific directions of space according to [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and ''[[Vajrayana|{{IAST|Vajrayāna}}]]'' [[Buddhism]]—especially [[Kalachakra|{{IAST|Kālacakra}}]]. As a group of eight deities, they are called '''{{IAST|Aṣṭa-Dikpāla}}''' (अष्ट-दिक्पाल), literally meaning guardians of eight directions. They are often augmented with two extra deities for the ten directions (the two extra directions being [[zenith]] and [[nadir]]), when they are known as the '''{{IAST|Daśa-Dikpāla}}'''. In Hinduism it is traditional to represent their images on the walls and ceilings of [[Hindu temple]]s. They are also often portrayed in Jain temples, with the exception that [[Nāga]] usually takes the place of [[Vishnu]]{{sfnp|Kumar|2001|p=17}} in the nadir. Ancient [[Java]] and [[Bali Hinduism]] recognize '''{{IAST|Nava-Dikpāla}}''', literally meaning guardians of nine directions, that consist of eight directions with one addition in the center. The nine guardian gods of directions is called ''Dewata Nawa Sanga'' (Nine guardian [[devata]]). The diagram of these guardian gods of directions is featured in [[Surya Majapahit]], the emblem of [[Majapahit empire]].

There are strong similarities between the concept of the '''guardians of the directions''' and the lore surrounding the Chinese [[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|four symbols]], four ancestral spirits who are responsible for four of the cardinal directions (North, South, East, and West).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Directions in Hindu tradition==
[[File:Brahma and the Lokapalas.jpg|thumb|Brahma, Lord of the Zenith (center) with (from left) Varuna, Kubera, Yama and Indra.]]Directions in Hindu tradition are called as ''{{IAST|Diśā}}'', or ''Dik''. There are four primary directions and a total of 10 directions.

In [[Hinduism]], the '''Maruts''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|r|ʊ|t|s}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/marut "Marut"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-sa|मरुत}}), also known as the '''Marutagana''' and sometimes identified with '''[[Rudras]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Hymns|page=352|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|author=Max Müller|author-link=Max Müller}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[Storm deity|storm deities]] and sons of [[Rudra]] and Prisni. The number of Maruts varies from 27 to sixty (three times sixty in [[Mandala 8|RV 8]].96.8). They are very violent and aggressive, described as armed with golden weapons i.e. lightning and thunderbolts, as having iron teeth and roaring like lions, as residing in the northwest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionnaire de la civilisation indienne|publisher=Robert Laffont|
author= Louis Frédéric|date=1987|isbn=2-221-01258-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; as riding in golden [[chariot]]s drawn by ruddy horses.

In the [[Vedic mythology]], the Maruts act as [[Indra]]'s companions as a troop of young warriors.&lt;ref name=Rel&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Witt Griswold|first1=Harvey|title=The Religion of the Rigveda|date=1923|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780896843059|pages=205–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to French comparative [[mythologist]] [[Georges Dumézil]], they are cognate to the [[Einherjar]] and the [[Wild hunt]].

== In mythology == 
Hymn 66 of Mandala VI of the [[Rig Veda]], the ancient collection of sacred hymns, is an eloquent account of how a natural phenomenon of a rain-storm metamorphoses into storm deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Hymns: Part I|publisher=[[Library of Alexandria]]|page=177|author=Max Müller, Hermann Oldenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Rig Veda they wore golden helmets and breastplates, and used their axes to split the clouds so that rain may fall. They were capable causing the mountains to tremble. Though they were the offspring of [[Rudra]], they were previously considered by [[Indra]], The main chieftain of heaven, &lt;ref name=Rel/&gt; who was entitled as ''Marutvant'' ("Accompanied by the Maruts"). They are also accompanied by a female deity, Rodasi, who rides with them through the heavens.&lt;ref name=Earl&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jamison|first1=Stephanie W.|last2=Brereton|first2=Joel P.|title=The Rigveda: The Earliest Religious Poetry of India, Volumen 1|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199370184|pages=49–}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is variously described as their mother and wife of Rudra, standing on the clouds that are the Maruts' chariot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lakshman Sarup|title=The Nighantu and the Nirukta: The Oldest Indian Treatise on Etymology, Philology and Semantics|url=|date=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=184|isbn=9788120813816}}&lt;/ref&gt; or their collective wife and beloved, who symbolizes lightning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Max Müller]]|title=Vedic Hymns, Parte 1|url=|date=1891|page=274|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maruts assist The King of heaven Indra, to defeat [[Vritra]], lending him their power.&lt;ref name=Rel/&gt; The myth continues with Indra disputing them their role on the battle, accusing them of having abandoned him after giving him encouragement before the fight, and they quarrel for the sacrifice given by the sage [[Agastya]]. However, their place to his side in mythology is accepted, appearing elsewhere with him.&lt;ref name=Earl/&gt;

According to later tradition, such as [[Purana]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Nature Myths: Legends of the Earth, Sea, and Sky|page=116|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|author=Tamra Andrews|year=2000|isbn=9780195136777|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7jS65aClvFEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Maruts were born from the broken womb of the goddess [[Diti]], after [[Indra]] hurled a thunderbolt at her to prevent her from giving birth to too powerful a son. The goddess had intended to remain pregnant for a century before giving birth to a son who would threaten Indra.

'''Mitra''' ([[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|Mitrá}}'') is a [[Deva (Hinduism)|Hindu god]] and generally one of the [[Adityas]] (the sons of the goddess [[Aditi]]), though his role has changed over time. In the [[#inscrip|Mitanni inscription]], Mitra is invoked as one of the protectors of treaties. In the [[Rigveda]], Mitra appears primarily in the ''[[dvandva]]'' compound ''Mitra-Varuna'', which has essentially the same attributes as the god [[Varuna]] alone,&lt;ref name="VR"&gt;{{cite book |last=MacDonell |first=Arthur Anthony |title=A Vedic Reader |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1917 |pages=78–83, 118–119, 134}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. as the principal guardian of {{IAST|[[ṛtá]]}} "Truth, Order". In the late Vedic texts and the [[Brahmana|''Brahmana''s]], Mitra is increasingly associated with the light of dawn and the morning sun (while Varuna becomes associated with the evening, and ultimately the night). In the post-Vedic texts &amp;ndash; in which Mitra practically disappears&lt;!-- while Varuna is relegated to a subsidiary position --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Visuvalingam |first=Elizabeth-Chalier |year=1989 |chapter=Bhairava's royal Brahmanicide |title=Criminal Gods and Demon Devotees: Essays on the guardians of popular Hinduism |location=New York, NY |publisher=State University Press |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; Mitra evolved into the patron divinity of friendship, and because he is "friend", abhors all violence, even when sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dumézil |first=Georges |title=Mitra-Varuna: An essay on two Indo-European representations of sovereignty |year=1990 |isbn=0-942299-13-2 |publisher=Zone Books |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Onomastics==
{{sister|project=wiktionary|text=Look up '''''[[wikt:Mitra|Mitra]]''''' and '''''[[wikt:मित्र#Sanskrit|मित्र]]''''' in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.}}
The [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] common noun [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-Iranian/mitrás|*''mitra'']] means "(that which) causes [-tra] to bind [mi-]", hence Sanskrit ''mitram'', "covenant, contract, oath",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayrhofer |first=Manfred |title=Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen |language=DE |trans-title=Etymological Dictionary of Old Indo-Aryan |volume=II |location=Heidelberg |publisher=Winter |year=1996 |pages=354–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; the protection of which is Mitra's role in both the [[Rigveda]] and in the Mitanni treaty. In post-Vedic India, the noun ''mitra'' came to be understood as "friend", one of the aspects of bonding and alliance. Accordingly, in post-Vedic India, Mitra became the guardian of friendships. In most [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], the word ''mitr'' means 'friend'. The feminine form of the word in languages like [[Marathi language|Marathi]] or Hindi is ''maitrin'' or ''mitrā''.

==In the Vedas==
In the [[Rigveda]], the oldest of the Vedic texts, Mitra is mostly indistinguishable from [[Varuna]], together with whom Mitra forms a ''[[dvandva]]'' pair Mitra-Varuna,{{efn|In Sanskrit ''[[dvandva]]'' compounds, the shorter name always appears first, regardless of seniority, hence 'Mitra-Varuna' even though Varuna is the more important of the two.&lt;!-- explanation of Duchesne-Gillemin: "Mitra coming first in the pair although he is the less important of the two, simply because in Sanskrit the shorter term in a compound always comes first" --&gt;}} and in which Mitra-Varuna has essentially the same characteristics as Varuna alone.&lt;ref name="VR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lüders |first=Heinrich |series=Varuna |volume=I |title=Varuna und das Wasser |language=DE |trans-title=Varuna and the Water(s) |editor-last=Alsdorf |editor-first=Ludwig |location=Göttingen |publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lüders |first=Heinrich |series=Varuna |volume=II |title=Varuna und das Rta |language=DE |trans-title=Varuna and the Rta |editor-last=Alsdorf |editor-first=Ludwig |location=Göttingen |publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varuna is not only the greater of the two, but also &amp;ndash; according to ''RV'' 2.12 &amp;ndash; the second-greatest of the RigVedic gods after [[Indra]].&lt;ref name="VR"/&gt;{{rp|134}} Rigvedic hymns to Mitra-Varuna include [[Mandala 1|RV 1]].136, 137, 151–153, [[Mandala 5|RV 5]].62-72, [[Mandala 6|RV 6]].67, [[Mandala 7|RV 7]].60-66, [[Mandala 8|RV 8]].25 and [[Mandala 10|RV 10]].132. Mitra is addressed independently in one hymn only [[Mandala 3|''RV'' 3]].59,&lt;ref name="VR"/&gt; where he has hardly any traits that distinguish him from Varuna,&lt;ref name="VR"/&gt; and owing to the scantiness of the information supplied in that hymn his separate character appears somewhat indefinite.&lt;ref name="VR"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mitra as an independent personage is insignificant. ...

===Asuras and devas===
Although they are Asuras, Rigvedic Mitra-Varuna are also addressed as [[Deva (Hinduism)|''devas'']] (e.g., ''RV'' 7.60.12). Mitra is also a ''deva'' (''mitrasya...devasya'', ''RV'' 3.59.6) in ''RV'' 3.59, which is the only Rigvedic hymn dedicated to Mitra independently from Mitra-Varuna. Despite the independent dedication, Mitra still retains much the same characteristics as Varuna in that hymn. Like Varuna, Mitra is lauded as a god following ''ṛta'', order and stability and of observances (3.59.2b, ''vrata''). Again like Varuna, Mitra is the sustainer of mankind (3.59.6a, said also of [[Indra]] in 3.37.4c) and of all gods (3.59.8c, ''[[Visvedevas|devān vishvān]]''). Elsewhere, when Mitra appears not paired with Varuna, it is often for the purpose of comparison, where other gods are lauded as being “like Mitra”, without the hymn being addressed to Mitra himself ([[Indra]] 1.129.10, 10.22.1–2 etc.; [[Agni]] 1.38.13 etc.; [[Soma (deity)|Soma]] 1.91.3; [[Vishnu]] 1.156.1). A characteristic unique to Mitra is his ability to marshal the people (''{{IAST|yātayati}}'', ''{{IAST|yātayáj-jana}}''), an attribute that appears to be peculiarly his.&lt;ref name="VR"/&gt;

===Distinct characteristics===
In some of their aspects, Varuna is lord of the cosmic rhythm of the sun and other celestial spheres, while Mitra brings forth the light at dawn, which was covered by Varuna the previous evening. Mitra is also independently identified as being force by which the course of the sun is regulated (ṛta); [[Savitr]] (''RV'' 1.35) is identified with Mitra because of those regulations, and [[Vishnu]] (''RV'' 1.154) takes his three steps by those regulations.&lt;ref name="VR"/&gt; Agni is kindled before dawn to produce Mitra, and when kindled is Mitra.&lt;ref name="VR"/&gt;

In the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'', Mitra is again associated with sunrise, and is contrasted with Varuna's association with the evening.&lt;ref name="VR"/&gt; In the [[Brahmana|''Brahmana''s]], the [[exegesis|exegetical]] commentaries on the Vedas, the associations with morning and evening lead Mitra to be connected with the day, and Varuna with night.&lt;ref name="VR"/&gt; Also in ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'', Mitra-Varuna is analyzed as "the Counsel and the Power" &amp;ndash; Mitra being the priesthood ([[Purohita]]), and Varuna the royal power ([[Raja|Rājān]]).

==In Post-Vedic texts==
Mitra appears in post-Vedic [[Hindu scriptures]] like the ''[[Ramayana]]'', the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', and the [[Puranas]]. However, his role gets significantly reduced and little is mentioned about him other than him being a solar deity and an [[Aditya]], (the sons of the goddess [[Aditi]], fathered by the sage [[Kashyapa]]).&lt;ref name = "W"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Williams |first=George M. |url=http://archive.org/details/isbn_9791576071068 |title=Handbook of Hindu mythology |date=2003 |publisher=Santa Barbara, Calif. : ABC Clio |others=Internet Archive |isbn=978-1-85109-650-3 |pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "H" &gt;{{Cite book |last=Hopkins |first=Edward Washburn |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-H0eiuvcG5IC&amp;q=+mitra&amp;pg=PA89 |title=Epic Mythology |date=June 1968 |publisher=Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers |isbn=978-0-8196-0228-2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', Revati (lit. 'prosperity') is the name of Mitra's wife and the couple has three sons—Utsarga, Arishtha and Pippala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Daniélou |first=Alain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=glwoDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=mitra+revat%C4%AB&amp;pg=PT162 |title=The Myths and Gods of India: The Classic Work on Hindu Polytheism from the Princeton Bollingen Series |date=1991-12-01 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-59477-733-2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pairing of Mitra with [[Varuna]] is still present;&lt;ref name = "H" /&gt; a [[yajna]] dedicated to them by [[Vaivasvata Manu]] is mentioned in these scriptures. An instance of rivalry between Varuna and Mitra also occurs; once both of them become enamored of the celestial nymph [[Urvashi]] and Varuna emits his seed into a divine pitcher. Mitra is promised her courtship, but she is more interested in Varuna. This causes Mitra's seed to fell from her womb into the same divine pitcher and he curses her for infidelity. From it, seers [[Vashishtha]] and [[Agastya]] are born, who are considered to be the sons of both Mitra and Varuna.&lt;ref name = "G" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "H" /&gt;

Other significant mentions about Mitra include the legend of [[Prithu]], where he acted as milkman of the gods to milk the cow form of the [[Bhūmi|earth goddess]]; his fight with Praheti in the [[Hindu mythological wars#The Devasura War|Devasura war]]; and his worship by [[Pandava]] King [[Yudhishthira]] and Akrura.&lt;ref&gt;Cologne Sanskrit Dictionaries: The Purana Index&lt;/ref&gt;

==In inscriptions{{anchor|inscrip}}==
Indic Mitra is first attested in a 14th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BCE [[Indo-Aryan superstrate in Mitanni|Mitanni inscription]] in which an Indo-Aryan king of [[Mitanni]] invokes the gods Mitra, [[Indra]], [[Varuna]], and the [[Nasatya]]s as guarantors of his sworn obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Læssøe |first=Jørgen |year=1963 |title=People of Ancient Assyria: Their inscriptions and correspondence |publisher=Routledge |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In living tradition==
In the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'', Mitra is associated with sunrise, and accordingly, Mitra is worshipped in the sunrise prayers of the Hindus. The morning ''upasthaana'' prayer, recited to the risen sun after contemplation on the sacred [[Gayatri]] [[mantra]], is a collection of Vedic verses addressing Mitra.

Mitra is co-worshipped in the [[Mitrotsavam]] Hindu festival of the Sun god [[Surya]], whose orderly traversal of the sky is ensured by Mitra (e.g. ''RV'' 1.35) and Mitra-Varuna (e.g. ''RV'' 8.25.8).

Mitra is also worshiped in Bengal in the month of Agrahayan (November- December). Worship begins on [[Kartik (month)|Kartik]] [[Sankranti]], the last day of the Bengali calendar month Kartik; and after worshiping the Mitra Dev (locally called Itu Thakur) for the full month, it{{clarify|date=December 2019}} is abducted into water on the day of Agrahayan Sankranti.

This puja is celebrated like a [[Vrata]] especially by women. On the first day, adherents bring a clay pot full of soil and plant many kind of seeds and plant roots in it. Every Sunday of the month they worship and sprinkle water on it. On the final day they abduct Itu Thakur in water before sunset.{{clarify|phrase "they the abducted"?|date=November 2019}}

'''Apam Napat''' is a deity in the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|Indo-Iranian]] [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] associated with water. His names in the [[Vedas]], '''''Apām Napāt''''', and in [[Zoroastrianism]], '''''Apąm Napāt''''', mean "child of the [[Ap (water)|waters]]" in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Avestan language|Avestan]] respectively. ''[[wikt:नपात्|Napāt]]'' ("grandson", "progeny") is cognate with [[Latin]] ''nepos'' and English ''[[nephew]]''.{{efn|name=a|[[Georges Dumézil]] and others have suggested an alternative origin for the name, which ties it etymologically to other Indo-European deities such as Etruscan [[Nethuns]], Celtic [[Nechtan (mythology)|Nechtan]] and Roman [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] (see [[Neptune (mythology)#Etymology|etymology of Neptune]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Philibert |first=Myriam |year=1997 |title=Les Mythes préceltiques |place=Monaco |publisher=Éditions du Rocher |pages=244–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dumézil |first=Georges |author-link=Georges Dumézil |year=1995 |title=Mythe et Epopée |volume=III |publisher=Quarto Gallimard, pub. Éditions Gallimard |isbn=2-07-073656-3 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the [[Rig Veda]], he is described as the creator of all things.&lt;ref name="RV2352"/&gt;

In the [[Vedas]] it is often apparent that ''Apām Napāt'' is being used as a title, not a proper name. This is most commonly applied to [[Agni]], god of fire, and occasionally to [[Savitr]], god of the sun. A correspondence has also been posited by [[Mary Boyce|Boyce]]&lt;ref name=Boyce-1989/&gt; between both the Vedic and Avestic traditions of Apam Napat, and [[Varuna]], who is also addressed as "Child of the Waters", and is considered a god of the sea.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Apąm Napāt |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/apam-napat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boyce-1989&gt;{{cite book |first=Mary |last=Boyce |author-link=Mary Boyce |year=1989 |title=A History of Zoroastrianism: The Early Period |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-08847-4 |pages=42–43, 45, 47–48 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3gfAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=F3gfAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA47 47–48]}} In the Iranian tradition, he is also called ''Burz'' ("high one," {{lang-fa|[[wikt:برز#Persian|برز]]|}}) and is a [[Yazata|''yazad'']].&lt;ref name=Boyce-1989/&gt;{{rp|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=F3gfAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42 42–43]}}

==Role==
In [[Yasht]]&amp;nbsp;19 of the Zoroastrian [[Avesta]] ''Apąm Napāt'' appears as the creator of mankind. However, since in Zoroastrianism [[Ahura Mazdā]] is venerated as supreme creator, this function of Apąm Napāt has become reduced. This is one reason ''Apąm Napāt'' is no longer widely worshipped, though he is still honoured daily through the Zoroastrian liturgies. The creator-god status is also seen in a hymn in honour of the Vedic ''Apām Napāt''.&lt;ref name="RV2352"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rig Veda |at=2.35.2 |chapter=Son of Waters |translator=Griffith, Ralph T.H. |edition=1896 |via=sacred-texts.com |chapter-url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv02035.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside [[Mithra]], Apąm Napāt maintains order in society, as well as [[Khvarenah]], by which legitimate rule is maintained among the Iranian peoples. It is his duty to distribute water from the sea to all regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.avesta.org/ka/yt8sbe.htm |chapter=Yasht&amp;nbsp;8.34 |translator=Darmesteter, James |title=Sacred Books of the East |edition=American |year=1898}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

==Fire and water==
In one Vedic hymn ''Apām Napāt'' is described as emerging from the water, golden, and "clothed in lightning", which has been conjectured to be a reference to fire.&lt;ref name="RV2352"/&gt; His regular identification with Agni, who is described  a number of times as hiding or residing in water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Shatapatha Brahmana|Satapatha Brahmana]] |chapter=Part&amp;nbsp;1 (SBE12) 1:2:3:1 |translator=Eggeling, Julius |edition=1882 |via=sacred-texts.com |chapter-url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbr/sbe12/sbe1209.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:The Rig Veda/Mandala 7/Hymn 49|Rig Veda 7.49.4]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:The Rig Veda/Mandala 3/Hymn 1|Rig Veda 3.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; and comparison with other Indo-European texts, has led some to speculate about the existence of a [[Proto-Indo-European mythology#Fire in water|Proto-Indo-European myth]] featuring a fire deity born from water.&lt;ref name=West-2007&gt;{{cite book |author=West, M.L. |title=Indo-European Poetry and Myth |date=24 May 2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-928075-9 |pages=270–272 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXrJA_5LKlYC&amp;pg=PA270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other such texts include a ninth-century Norwegian poem that uses the name ''sǣvar niþr'', meaning "grandson of the sea," as a [[kenning]] for fire, and an old Armenian poem in which a reed in the middle of the sea spontaneously catches fire, from which springs the hero [[Vahagn]], with fiery hair and eyes that blaze like sun.

===Conjectured original fireless myth===
Whether fire was an original part of Apam Napat's nature remains a matter of debate, especially since this connection is absent from the Iranian version. [[Hermann Oldenberg]] believed Apam Napat was originally an independent water deity who later came to be associated with Agni, in part because of an ancient Indian belief that water contained fire within itself,&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; fire appearing to "enter into" water when quenched by it.&lt;ref name=Oldenberg&gt;{{cite book |first=Hermann |last=Oldenberg |year=1894 |title=Die Religion des Veda |trans-title=The Religion of the Veda |pages=100–119 |lang=de |place=Berlin, DE |publisher=W. Hertz |url=https://archive.org/details/diereligiondesv00oldegoog |via=Archive.org}}

Associations with Savitr could be understood as similarly deriving from an image of the setting sun sinking into the ocean. Another theory explains the connection between fire and water through lightning, "the flash of fire born from the rainbearing clouds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Findly |first=Ellison Banks |year=1979 |title=The 'Child of the Waters': A Revaluation of Vedic Apāṃ Napāt |journal=Numen |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=164–184 |doi=10.2307/3269717 |jstor=3269717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==='Swamp gas' conjecture===
Based on the idea that this fire-from-water image was inspired by flaming seepage natural gas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tyrrell |first1=Maliheh S. |date=2000 |title=Aesopian Literary Dimensions of Azerbaijani Literature of the Soviet Period, 1920-1990 |page=34 |publisher=Lexington Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Azerbaijan early history |website=[[About.com]] |url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library |access-date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts have been made to connect the name "Apam Napat" to the word "[[wikt:naphtha|naphtha]]", which passed into Greek – and thence English – from an Iranian language.

However, there is only a modest amount of evidence for a link between the sacred fires of Iranian religion and petroleum or natural gas – although the account of the blowing of the 3&amp;nbsp;sacred fires out to sea from the back of the ox Srishok where, unquenched, they continue to burn on the water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Bundahishn]] |chapter=chapter&amp;nbsp;18 verses&amp;nbsp;8–9 |chapter-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is suggestive – particularly in relation to [[hydrocarbon]] deposits in the Southwestern part of the [[Caspian Sea]], exploited currently by the [[Absheron gas field]] near [[Baku]] in [[Azerbaijan]].

The etymology of the word "naphtha" has been claimed likely to relate to the Akkadian ''napṭu'', "petroleum".&lt;ref name="Forbes1966"&gt;{{cite book |author=R. J.

*'''Two [[Ashvins]]''' (or Nāsatyas), twin solar deities.

===Variations===
The list of Vedic Devas somewhat varies across the manuscripts found in different parts of South Asia, particularly in terms of guides (Aswins) and personified Devas. One list based on Book 2 of Aitereya Brahmana is:&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Oldenberg (1988), The Religion of the Veda, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803923}}, pp. 23-50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AA MacDonell, {{Google books|KCQ_AQAAMAAJ|Vedic mythology|page=PA19}}, Oxford University Press, pp. 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* Devas personified: [[Indra]] ({{IAST|Śakra}}), [[Varuna|{{IAST|Varuṇa}}]], [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]], [[Aryaman]], [[Bhaga]], [[Ansa (Hinduism)|{{IAST|Aṃśa}}]], Vidhata,&lt;ref&gt;Francis X Clooney (2010), Divine Mother, Blessed Mother, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199738731}}, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tvashtri|{{IAST|Tvāṣṭṛ}}]], [[Pushan|{{IAST|Pūṣan}}]], [[Vivasvan|Vivasvat]] (Surya), [[Savitr|{{IAST|Savitṛ}}]] (Dhatr), Vishnu.
* Devas as abstractions or inner principles: Ānanda (bliss, inner contentment), Vijñāna (knowledge), Manas (mind, thought), Prāṇa (life-force), Vāc (speech), [[Atman (Hinduism)|Ātmā]] (Self within each person), and five manifestations of ''Rudra/Shiva'' – [[Ishana|Īśāna]], Tatpuruṣa, Aghora, Vāmadeva, Sadyojāta
* Devas as forces or principles of nature – [[Prithvi|{{IAST|Pṛthivī}}]] (earth), [[Agni]] (fire), Antarikṣa (atmosphere, space), Jal (water), [[Vayu|Vāyu]] (wind), [[Dyaus Pita|{{IAST|Dyauṣ}}]] (sky), [[Surya|Sūrya]] (sun), {{IAST|Nakṣatra}} (stars), Soma (moon)
* Devas as guide or creative energy – Vasatkara, [[Prajapati|Prajāpati]]

The identity of the 2 [[Ashvins]] sometimes varies:

{{blockquote|There are eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Âdityas; and these two, Heaven and Earth, are the (thirty-second and) thirty-third. And there are thirty-three gods, and Pragâpati is the thirty-fourth;--thus he makes him (the sacrificer, or Yagña) to be Pragâpati 2: now that 3 is, for that is immortal, and what is immortal that is. But what is mortal that also is Pragâpati; for Pragâpati is everything: thus he makes him to be Pragâpati, and hence there are these thirty-four utterances, called expiations. {{refn|group=note|''aṣṭau vasavaḥ : ekādaśa rudrā dvādaśādityā ime eva dyāvāpṛthivī trayastriṃśyau trayastriṃśadvai devāḥ prajāpatiścatustriṃśastadenam prajāpatiṃ karotyetadvā astyetaddhyamṛtaṃ yaddhyamṛtaṃ taddhyastyetadu tadyanmartyaṃ sa eṣa prajāpatiḥ sarvaṃ vai prajāpatistadenam prajāpatiṃ karoti tasmādetāścatustriṃśadvyāhṛtayo bhavanti prāyaścittayo nāma.''}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbr/sbe26/sbe2666.htm|title=Satapatha Brahmana Part II (SBE26), Julius Eggeling tr.

'''Harihara''' ([[Sanskrit]]: हरिहर) is the fused [[Sattva|sattvika]] characterisation of [[Vishnu]] (Hari) and [[Shiva]] (Hara) from [[Hinduism|Hindu]] theology. Hari is the form of Vishnu, and Hara is the form of Shiva. Harihara is also known as '''Shankaranarayana''' ("Shankara" is Shiva, and "Narayana" is Vishnu).

''Harihara'' is also sometimes used as a philosophical term to denote the unity of Vishnu and Shiva as different aspects of the same Ultimate Reality called [[Brahman]]. This concept of equivalence of various gods as one principle and "oneness of all existence" is discussed as Harihara in the texts of [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;David Leeming (2001), A Dictionary of Asian Mythology, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195120530}}, page 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest sculptures of Harihara, with one half of the image as Vishnu and other half as Shiva, are found in the surviving cave temples of India, such as in the cave 1 and cave 3 of the 6th-century [[Badami cave temples]].&lt;ref&gt;Alice Boner (1990), Principles of Composition in Hindu Sculpture: Cave Temple Period, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807051}}, pages 89-95, 115-124, 174-184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TA Gopinatha Rao (1993), Elements of Hindu iconography, Vol 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120808775}}, pages 334-335&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:Indian god-sivakesava.JPG|thumb|[[Vishnu]] (holding [[Sudarshana Chakra]]) and [[Shiva]] (lighter coloured half, wearing tiger skin,  holding [[Trishula]]) combined in a single Harihara [[murti]], sometimes referred to as ''Sivakesava''and "Haryadhamurti".]]
The diversity within Hinduism encourages a wide variety of beliefs and traditions, of which two important and large traditions are associated with Vishnu and Shiva. Some schools focus on Vishnu (including his associated [[avatar]]s such as Rama and Krishna) as the Supreme God, and others on Shiva (including his different avatars such as Mahadeva and Pashupata). The [[Puranas]] and various Hindu traditions treat both Shiva and Vishnu as being different aspects of the one [[Brahman]]. Harihara is a symbolic representation of this idea. A similar idea, called [[Ardhanarishvara]] or ''Naranari'', fuses masculine and feminine deities as one and equivalent representation in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Goldberg (2002), The Lord who is half woman: Ardhanārīśvara in Indian and feminist perspective, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-791453251}}, pages 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on which scriptures (and translations) are quoted, evidence is available to support each of the different arguments. In most cases, even if one personality is taken as being superior over the other, much respect is still offered to both Vishnu and Shiva by the other's worshippers (i.e. Shiva is still regarded as being above the level of an ordinary [[jiva]] and 'the greatest of the Vaishnavas' by Vaishnavas who worship only Vishnu).&lt;ref&gt;"Lord Sambhu [Siva] the greatest of Vaishnavas and vice versa" from [http://srimadbhagavatam.com/12/13/16/en1 Bhag-Purana 12.13.16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009160352/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/12/13/16/en1 |date=9 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Swaminarayan]] holds that Vishnu and Shiva are different aspects of the same God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kakaji.org/shikshapatri_verses.asp?catid=viewAll] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180131/http://www.kakaji.org/shikshapatri_verses.asp?catid=viewAll |date=3 March 2016 }}, verses 47, 84, of their scripture, [[Shikshapatri]], [http://www.kakaji.org/shikshapatri_verses.asp?catid=viewAll] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180131/http://www.kakaji.org/shikshapatri_verses.asp?catid=viewAll |date=3 March 2016 }} states, "And the oneness of [[Narayana]] and [[Shiva]] should be understood, as the Vedas have described both to be brahmaroopa, or form of [[Brahman]], i.e., [[Saguna Brahman]], indicating that Vishnu and Shiva are different forms of the one and same God.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/scriptures/index.asp?idCategory=2&amp;curPage=2&amp;MediaType= Swaminarayan Satsang – Scriptures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716171647/http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/scriptures/index.asp?idCategory=2&amp;curPage=2&amp;MediaType= |date=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/scriptures/scriptureexplanation.asp?IDProduct=762&amp;idcategory=2={{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Legends ==
The earliest mention of Harihara is likely to be observed in the [[Harivamsa|Harivamsha]], where [[Markandeya]] discusses the being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Suresh |first=K. M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r7xmluMu-FsC&amp;q=harihara+purana |title=Sculptural Art of Hampi |date=1998 |publisher=Directorate of Archaeology and Museums |pages=68 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to one legend, when Vishnu appeared as the enchantress [[Mohini]] in front of Shiva, the latter grew besotted with her and attempted to embrace her. At this moment, Mohini reverted to the true form of Vishnu, at which point the two deities fused as one being, Harihara.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Coulter |first1=Charles Russell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QEJUEAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=harihara+god&amp;pg=PA204 |title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities |last2=Turner |first2=Patricia |date=2021-12-06 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-9179-7 |pages=204 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shiva's pale skin may be read as ash-covered in his role as an ascetic.  The Vishnu half will wear a tall [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] and other [[jewelry]], representing his responsibility for maintaining world order. Vishnu's black skin represents holiness.  Broadly, these distinctions serve to represent the duality of humble religious influence in the ascetic and authoritative secular power in the king or householder.&lt;ref&gt;Thirty Thousand Years of Art.  Phaidon Press Limited.  p. 484&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in other aspects Shiva also takes on the authoritative position of householder, a position which is [[Shiva#Ascetic and householder|directly at odds]] with the ascetic position depicted in his Harihara manifestation.{{Cn|date=February 2022}}

Harihara has been part of temple iconography throughout South Asia and Southeast Asia, with some illustrations listed in the following table. In some states, the concept of Harihara appears through alternate names and its progeny; for example, temples incorporating [[Ayyappan]] and [[Shasta (deity)|Shasta]] deities in [[Kerala]] illustrate this Hindu tradition there since at least the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Ryan (2007), Encyclopedia of Hinduism, {{ISBN|978-0816054589}}, page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu scripture ''[[Mahabharata]]'' identifies the prince [[Arjuna]] with Nara, and the deity [[Krishna]] with Narayana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2015-09-27|title=Twin incarnation of the Lord|language=en-IN|work=The Hindu|url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/religion/religion-twin-incarnation-of-the-lord/article7695022.ece|access-date=2021-06-28|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend of Nara-Narayana is also told in the scripture ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]''. Hindus believe that the pair dwells at [[Badrinath]], where their most important [[Badrinath Temple|temple]] stands.

==Etymology==
[[File:Nara narayana.jpg|230px|thumb|Narayana on the left and Nara on the right, [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh]], ca. 5th century AD]]
The name "Nara-Narayana" can be broken into two [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] terms, ''Nara'' and ''Narayana''. Nara means male being, and [[Narayana]] refers to the name of the deity.

[[Monier-Williams]] dictionary says Nara is "the primeval Man or eternal Spirit pervading the universe always associated with Narayana, "son of the primeval man". In epic poetry, they are the sons of [[Dharma]] by Murti or Ahimsa, and emanations of [[Vishnu]], [[Arjuna]] being identified with Nara, and [[Krishna]] with Narayana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0528-nabhoyoni.jpg][http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0529-narakapAla.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Nara-Narayana bhadrekashyam doing tapas.jpg|thumb|260x260px|Nara and Narayana performing tapas.]]
Nara-Narayana are depicted jointly or separately in images. When depicted separately, Nara is portrayed with two hands and wearing deer skin, while Narayana is shown on the right in the usual form of Vishnu. Nara is supposed to be depicted as fair-complexioned, while Narayana is to be portrayed as dark-complexioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Satyamayananda |first=Swami |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1iGKDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=nara+narayana+dark+fair&amp;pg=PT132 |title=Ancient Sages |date=2019 |publisher=Advaita Ashrama (A publication branch of Ramakrishna Math, Belur Math) |isbn=978-81-7505-923-8 |pages=132 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, both of them are depicted identical to each other. They are depicted four-armed and holding a mace, a discus, a conch, and a lotus, resembling Vishnu.

=== Birth ===
According to [[Dineshchandra Sircar|D.C. Sircar]], before their incarnations as Arjuna-Krishna, the duo were born as the [[Rishi|sages]] Nara-Narayana, the latter being the son of [[Dharma]]. They travelled from the world of men to the world of [[Brahman]] and, with veneration from both the devas and the [[Gandharva|gandharvas]], existed exclusively for the destruction of [[Asura|asuras]]. [[Indra]] is described to have been assisted by Nara and Narayana in his conflict with the [[Asura|asuras]].   

According to the [[Vamana Purana]], the twins were sons of [[dharma]], the son of [[Brahma]] and his wife Murti (daughter of [[Daksha]]), or Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Vamana]] Purana, Chapter 6 - Bhandarkar p.46&lt;/ref&gt; They live at [[Badrinath|Badrika]], performing severe austerities and meditation, for the welfare of the world and mankind. 

===Birth of Urvashi===
The [[Bhagavata Purana]] narrates [[Urvashi]]'s birth from the sages Nara-Narayana.&lt;ref&gt;''The Goddess in India: The Five Faces of the Eternal Feminine'' By Devdutt Pattanaik, Published 2000, Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Company, 176 pages, {{ISBN|0-89281-807-7}} p.66&lt;/ref&gt; Once, the sages Nara-Narayana were meditating in the holy shrine of Badrinath situated in the [[Himalayas]]. Their penances and austerities alarmed the devas, and so [[Indra]], the King of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s, sent [[Kamadeva]], [[Rati]], [[Vasanta (Ritu)|Vasanta]] (spring), and various [[apsaras]] (nymphs) such as [[Menaka]] and [[Rambha (apsara)|Rambha]] to inspire them with erotic passion, and disturb their devotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2019-01-28 |title=Story of Nārāyaṇa |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/compilation/puranic-encyclopaedia/d/doc241796.html |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sage Narayana took a flower and placed it on his thigh. Immediately, there sprung from it a beautiful nymph, whose charms far excelled those of the apsaras, and made them return to [[Svarga|heaven]], filled with shame and vexation. Narayana sent this nymph to Indra with them, and since she been produced from the thigh (Ūru in [[Sanskrit]]) of the sage, she was called [[Urvashi]]. Having sent back the apsaras, the divine sages continued to meditate.&lt;ref&gt;''Tales from the Puranas'' By Mahesh Sharma, pp.60-62, Diamond Pocket Books (P) Ltd.,{{ISBN|81-288-1040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vijnanananda267"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vijnanananda|2004|pp=267–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflict with Shiva ===
According to the [[Mahabharata]], Shiva's [[trishula]], after laying waste to [[Daksha yajna|Daksha's yajna]], travelled to the [[Badrinath|Badarikāśrama]], where it pierced the breast of Narayana, who had been engaged in a penance. By the force of the utterance of the sound 'Hum', produced by Narayana, the trident was subsequently ejected from his breast and returned to Shiva, who was then determined to slay the sages. Nara is stated to have plucked a blade of grass from the earth, which became an axe, and discharged it towards the destroyer deity. Shiva is described to have broken this axe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2019-01-28 |title=Story of Nara |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/compilation/puranic-encyclopaedia/d/doc241792.html |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] tradition, the sage Narayana performed great penances at the holy spot of Badarikāśrama, propitiating Shiva, and becoming invincible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dineschandra Sircar |url=http://archive.org/details/Sircar1971 |title=Studies In The Religious Life Of Ancient and Medieval India by Dineschandra Sircar (1971) |date=1971 |pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Badrinath ===
[[File:Badrinath temple.jpg|thumb|260px|right|[[Badrinath temple]]]]
According to the [[Bhagavata Purana]], "There in Badrikashram ([[Badrinath]]) the Personality of Godhead ([[Vishnu]]), in his incarnation as the sages Nara and Narayana, had been undergoing great penance since time immemorial for the welfare of all living entities." (3.4.22)

In [[Badrinath Temple]]'s sanctorum, to the far right side of the stone image of Badri-Vishala (or Badri-Narayana), are the images of Nara and Narayana. Also, the Nara and Narayana peaks tower over Badrinath.

=== Duel against Prahlada ===
[[Prahlada]], the king of the asuras, once commanded his forces to accompany him to the holy [[Tirtha (Hinduism)|tirtha]] of Naimiṣa, where he hoped to see a vision of Vishnu. They went hunting along the banks of the [[Sarasvati River|Sarasvati river]]. Prahlada observed two ascetics with matted hair, bearing the bows of [[Sharanga]] and [[Gandiva|Ajagava]]. The asura king asked them why they held weapons while performing a penance, and the two ascetics responded that all those who held power were righteous in their conduct. One of the [[Rishi|rishis]] assured the king that none in the three worlds could conquer them in a duel. Prahlada rose to the challenge. Nara fired arrows upon the king with his Ajagava, but the latter was able to defeat him with his own gold-plated arrows. Prahlada employed the divine Brahmastra against Nara's Narayanastra. Seeing them neutralised in a mid-air collision, Prahlada wielded his mace against Narayana. His mace broke, and Prahlada found himself growing helpless, and sought Vishnu's assistance. Vishnu told his devotee that the Nara-Narayana brothers were invincible, as they were the sons of [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], and could only be conquered in devotion rather than combat. The king left the regency to [[Andhaka]], and erected an ashrama to propitiate Nara-Narayana, and apologised for his folly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2019-01-28 |title=Story of Prahlāda |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/compilation/puranic-encyclopaedia/d/doc241839.html |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arjuna-Krishna ===
[[File:Nara Narayana 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Nara Narayana as per Mahabharata]]

[[Arjuna]] and [[Krishna]] are often referred to as Nara-Narayana in the [[Mahabharata]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Mahabharata, Book 1: Adi Parva: Section I |url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01002.htm |access-date=2021-01-11 |website=www.sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are considered reincarnations of Nara and Narayana respectively, according to the [[Devi Bhagavata Purana]].&lt;ref name="Vijnanananda250"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vijnanananda|2004|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bhandarkar, the deities of Nara-Narayana must have been very popular at the time of the composition of the [[Mahabharata]], since in the opening stanzas of various [[Mahabharata#The_18_parvas_or_books|''parvas'']] (constituent books) of the epic, obeisance is made to these two devas. In [[Vana Parva]] (12. 46, 47), Krishna says to Arjuna, "O invincible one, you are Nara and I am Hari Narayana, and we, the sages Nara-Narayana, have come to this world at the proper time.." In the same Parva, chapter 40 (verse 1); [[Shiva]] says to Arjuna — "In former birth you were Nara and with Narayana as your companion, performed austerities for thousands of years at Badari".&lt;ref name="Bhandarkar"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03040.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Kairata Parva: Section XL|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2019-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mahabharata suggests that by saluting Krishna (the omniscient Narayana), his friend and the highest of all male beings Arjuna, [[Saraswati]], and [[Vyasa]], the orator, and destroying demonic possessions, and conquering the conscience, one should recite the epic Mahabharata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Sankshipt Mahabharat Vol 1 Gita Press Gorakhpur |url=https://archive.org/details/sankshipt-mahabharat-vol-1-gita-press-gorakhpur/page/n27/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==
In the [[Swaminarayan]] sect, Nara and Narayana, are called ''Nara-Narayana Deva''. They are believed to reside at Badrikashram and to be the prime controllers of the destiny of all beings, depending on their [[karma]]. Nara-Narayana Deva are believed to have manifested at Narayana Ghat on the banks of river [[Sabarmati]] at [[Ahmedabad]]. Therefore, their [[murti|images]] were installed by Swaminarayan at the first Swaminarayan temple, [[Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Ahmedabad|Swaminarayan Mandir, Ahmedabad]] ([[India]]).

Members of this group interpret the events that took place at [[Badrinath|Badarikashram]], the abode of [[Nara Narayana]], that led to the incarnation of Swaminarayan. They believe that Narayana took birth as Swaminarayan due to a curse of sage [[Durvasa]] which he accepted at his own will. The curse led to Narayana taking the form of an avatar on Earth to destroy evil and establish ''ekantik-[[dharma]]'', religion based on morality, knowledge, detachment, and devotion.&lt;ref name="Badrikashram"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/lordswaminarayan/literaturestory.asp?StoryID=233 | title= History of Incarnation of Lord Shree Swaminarayan | url-status= dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090910011046/http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/lordswaminarayan/literaturestory.asp?StoryID=233 | archive-date= 10 September 2009 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is exclusive to the Swaminarayan sect.

In [[Hinduism]], '''Dharā''' ([[Sanskrit]]: धरा; Support) is one of the [[Vasus]], gods of the physical cosmos. He represents the earth and the element earth, though Earth is usually the goddess [[Prithvi]] rather than a god. Dhārā (Sanskrit: धारा) is a Sanskrit term used to refer to the flow of a stream or waterfall.

'''Pulastya''' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: पुलस्त्य) is one of the ten [[Prajapati]], and one of the [[Mānasaputra|mind-born]] sons of [[Brahma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02011.htm|title=''The Mahabharata''|author=[[Kisari Mohan Ganguli]] (1883 - 1896)|publisher=Sacred texts}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hinduism]]. He is also one of the [[Saptarishi]] (Seven great sages) in the first age of Manu, the [[Manvantara]].&lt;ref name=Tantra&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/tantra/maha/maha00.htm Inhabitants of the Worlds] Mahanirvana Tantra, translated by Arthur Avalon, ([[John Woodroffe|Sir John Woodroffe]]), 1913, Introduction and Preface. The Rishi are seers who know, and by their knowledge are the makers of shastra and "see" all mantras. The word comes from the root rish Rishati-prapnoti sarvvang mantrang jnanena pashyati sangsaraparangva, etc. The seven great Rishi or saptarshi of the first manvantara are '''Marichi, Atri, Angira, Pulaha, Kratu, Pulatsya, and Vashishtha'''. In other manvantara there are other ''saptarishi''. In the present manvantara the seven are '''Kashyapa''', ''Atri, Vashishtha, Vishvamitra, Gautama, Jamadagni, Bharadvaja''. To the Rishi the Vedas were revealed. Vyasa taught the Rigveda so revealed to Paila, the Yajurveda to Vaishampayana, the Samaveda to Jaimini, Atharvaveda to Samantu, and Itihasa and Purana to Suta. The three chief classes of rishi are the Brahmarshi, born of the mind of Brahma, the Devarshi of lower rank, and Rajarshi or Kings who became rishi through their knowledge and austerities, such as Janaka, Ritaparna, etc. Thc Shrutarshi are makers of Shastras, as Sushruta. The Kandarshi are of the Karmakanda, such as Jaimini.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Legend ==

=== Origin ===
The sage is said to have emerged from the ear of Brahma in the [[Bhagavata Purana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2019-01-28 |title=Story of Pulastya |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/compilation/puranic-encyclopaedia/d/doc241852.html |access-date=2022-10-28 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Children ===
The [[Ramayana]] describes Pulastya's wedding to Manini, and the birth of his son, [[Vishrava]]. Once, Pulastya was engaged in austerities in the [[Ashram|ashrama]] of Trinabindu, on the slopes of [[Mount Meru]]. Even as he was engaged in a penance in solitude, he was disturbed by a number of youthful maidens, the daughters of other sages, [[Nāga|naga]] maidens, as well as [[Apsara|apsaras]]. They played their musical instruments and danced, seeking to divert his attention. Enraged, Pulastya declared that she among them who fell under his gaze would instantly get impregnated. Terrified of the [[Brahmin|Brahmin's]] curse, the girls vanished. During this moment, Manini, the daughter of Trinabindu, who had not been present when the curse was invoked, wandered near the sage, searching for her friends. She found herself pregnant, and rushed to report her condition to her father. The sage Trinabindu requested Pulastya to marry his daughter, and the latter agreed, and so the two lived together in the ashrama. Pleased with his wife's virtuous conduct, Pulastya declared that their child would inherit her virtue, and would be named Vishrava.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2020-09-27 |title=The Birth of Vishravas [Chapter 2] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-ramayana-of-valmiki/d/doc424763.html |access-date=2022-10-28 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vishrava went on to have two wives: one was [[Kaikesi]] who gave birth to [[Ravana]], [[Shurpanakha]], [[Kumbhakarna]], and [[Vibhishana]]; and another was [[Ilavida]], and had a son named [[Kubera]].

Pulastya also becomes the father of Agastya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2012-06-15 |title=Agastya, Āgastya: 32 definitions |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/agastya |access-date=2022-10-28 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meeting Bhishma ===
Once, [[Bhishma]] lived in near the sacred source of the river [[Ganges|Ganga]], called Gaṅgādvāra. Pulastya makes his presence known before Bhishma, pleased by his austerities. Bhishma offers libations of water and pays his respects to the sage. Pleased, Pulastya instructs Bhishma regarding the path of [[dharma]], which itself had been taught to him by Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2019-07-30 |title=Contents of the Section on Creation (Sṛṣṭi-khaṇḍa) [Chapter 2] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-padma-purana/d/doc364122.html |access-date=2022-10-28 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-JZAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=bhishma+pulastya&amp;pg=PA238 |title="The" Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated Into English Prose |date=1884 |publisher=Bhārata Press |pages=238 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narrator ===
He serves as the medium through which some of the ''[[Puranas]]'' were communicated to the mankind.&lt;ref name="Dowson2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=John Dowson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=leH7AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA244 |title=A Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology and Religion, Geography, History and Literature |date=5 November 2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-39029-6 |pages=244–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the Vishnu Purana from Brahma, and communicated it to [[Parashara]], who made it known to mankind.

Pulastya responds to the questions of [[Narada]] in the [[Vamana Purana]] by reciting legends.

=== Ramakien ===
In Thai [[National epic]] [[Ramakien]], Pulastya is called ''Latsatian''. He was the second king of Lanka and the father of [[Ravana|Thotsakan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ความรู้เรื่อง'ทศกัณฐ์'จาก อ.อักษรศาสตร์ จุฬาฯ-'วัฒนธรรมย่อมเปลี่ยนไปตามผู้เสพ'|url=https://www.matichon.co.th/social/news_295034|publisher=[[Matichon]] Online|date=22 September 2016|access-date=27 August 2019|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology ==
Certain sources claim that the famous granite statue of a king in [[Polonnaruwa]], [[Sri Lanka]], which was first thought to be of King [[Parakramabahu I|Parakramabahu the Great]], might actually be the Pulastya Rishi. This idea was later proven to be false by [[Senarath Paranavithana|Prof. Senarath Paranawithana]]. Apart from this, no other statues, carvings, paintings or friezes of Pulastya Rishi have been found on the island ([[Sri Lanka]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

==Description==
It is assumed Parjanya is the udder and lightning is the teats of the rain-cow, accordingly rain represents her milk.

He is also considered as a protector of poets and an enemy of flesh-eating fire.&lt;ref&gt;Vedic Mythology - Nagendra Kr Singh - APH Publishing, Jan 1, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meanings==
According to his 1965 ''Sanskrit–English Dictionary'', [[Vaman Shivram Apte]] gives the following meanings:
* Rain-cloud, thunder cloud, a cloud in general;
* Rain (as referred in the [[Shloka]] from [[Bhagavad Gita]] Chapter 3 Verse 14);
* The god (deva) of rain i.e. [[Indra]].

Two hymns of the Rigveda, 5.83 and 7.101, are dedicated to Parjanya. In [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''Parjanya'' means "[[rain]]" or "raincloud". Prayers dedicated to ''Parjanya'', to invoke the blessings of rains are mentioned in the [[Atharvaveda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/av/av04015.htm Prayer.. ] [[Atharvaveda]], translated by [[Ralph T.H. Griffith]], 1895, Book 4: Hymn 15, A charm to hasten the coming of the rains.&lt;/ref&gt;
Parjanya was also one of the [[Saptarishi]] (Seven Great Sages [[Rishi]]) in the fifth [[Manvantara]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp075.htm Fifth interval of Manu] [[Vishnu Purana]], translated by [[Horace Hayman Wilson]], 1840, Book III: Chapter I. p. 262-263, In the fifth interval the Manu was Raivata: the Indra was Vibhu: the classes of gods, consisting of fourteen each, were the Amitábhas, Abhútarajasas, Vaikunthas, and Sumedhasas: the seven Rishis were
Hirańyaromá, Vedasrí, Urddhabáhu, Vedabáhu, Sudháman, '''Parjanya''', and Mahámuni.&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the 12 [[Adityas]] and according to the [[Vishnu Purana]], the guardian of the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartik]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp068.htm Parashara...In the month of Kártik they are Parjanya, Bharadwája, (another) Viswávasu, Viswáchí, Senajit, Airávata, and Chápa] [[Vishnu Purana]], translated by [[Horace Hayman Wilson]], Book II: Chapter X. p. 233, Names of the twelve Ádityas.

==In relation to other deities==
{{main|Perkwunos}}
The deity can be identified with various other Indo-European Gods such as [[Slavs|Slavic]] ''[[Perun]]'', [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''[[Perkūnas]]'', [[Latvian language|Latvian]] ''[[Perkūnas|Pērkons]]'' and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''[[Perkele]]'' "god of thunder",   [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''fairguni'' "mountain", and Mordvin language ''Pur'ginepaz''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/srp/srp05.htm#fr_72 Parjanya means "the rain" or "the thunderer..] Songs of the Russian People, by W. R. S. Ralston, 1872, Chapter II: Section I.--The Old Gods. p. 87. The description of '''Parjanya''' is in all respects applicable to the deity worshipped by the different branches of the Slavo-Lettic family under various names, such as the Lithuanian Perkunas, Lettish Pērkons, the Old Prussian Perkunos, the Polish Piorun, the Bohemian Peraun, and the Russian Perun. There is resemblance also to the Finnic Mordvin / Erza thunder god Pur'ginepaz. According to a Lithuanian legend, known also to other Indo-European nations, the Thunder-God created the universe by the action of warmth&amp;mdash;Perkunas wis iszperieje. The verb perieti (present form periu) means to produce by means of warmth, to hatch, to bear, being akin to the Latin pario, and the Russian parit' . In Lithuania Perkunas, as the God of Thunder, was worshipped with great reverence. His statue is said to have held in its hand "a precious stone like fire," shaped "in the image of the lightning," and before it constantly burnt an oak-wood fire. If the fire by any chance went out, it was rekindled by means of sparks struck from the stone. The Mordvin /Erza tradition has " Sparks fly from the cartwheels and the hooves of fiery-red horses of ''Pur'ginepaz'', when he drives across the sky " (''Yurtov, A. 1883. Obraztsy mordovskoi narodnoi slovesnosti. 2nd ed. Kazan. :129'')

 ''{{IAST|írā víśvasmai bhúvanāya jāyate yát parjányaḥ pṛthivîṃ rétasâvati}}''

'''Revanta''' or '''Raivata''' (Sanskrit: रेवन्त, lit. "brilliant") is a minor [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity. According to the ''[[Rig-Veda]]'', Revanta is the youngest son of the sun-god [[Surya]], and his wife [[Saranyu]]. Revanta is chief of the [[Guhyakas]], semi-divine and demonic class entities – like the [[Yakshas]] – who are believed to live as forest dwellers in the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0888-revatottara.jpg Monier-Williams Dictionary: Revanta]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0360-guruvyatha.jpg Monier-Williams Dictionary:Guhyaka]&lt;/ref&gt; Images and sculptures of Revanta often show him as a huntsman on a horse, with a bow and arrow.

The worship of Revanta was especially common in medieval Eastern India ([[Bihar]] and [[Bengal]]) with many archaeological finds indicating the existence of a cult dedicated to him that began in the 6th century A.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jash |first1=Pranabananda |title=THE CULT OF REVANTA IN EASTERN INDIA |journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress |date=1978 |volume=39 |pages=990-999 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44139448}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legends==

The tale of Revanta's birth is narrated in scriptures like the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' and the ''[[Markandeya Purana]]''. Once, Sanjna ([[Saranyu]]), the daughter of celestial architect [[Vishvakarma]] and wife of Surya, unable to take the fervour of the Sun-god, repaired to the forests to engage in devout austerities in the form of a mare. She placed her shadow [[Chhaya]], who looked just like Sanjna in her position as Surya's wife. When Surya realised that Chhaya was not the real Sanjna, he searched for Sanjna and finally found her in the forests of Uttar Kuru. There, Surya approached Sanjna disguised as a horse. Their union produced the twin-[[Ashvins]] and Revanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh|1997|pp=2605–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Kurma Purana]]'' and the ''[[Matsya Purana]]'', the mother of Revanta is named [[Ratri]] (Rajni), another wife of Surya. While in another chapter of the ''Markandeya Purana'', he is son of Chhaya and his brothers are the Saturn-god [[Shani]], [[Tapati]] and [[Savarni Manu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Myths and Gods of India: The Classic Work on Hindu Polytheism |first=Alain |last=Danielou | author-link=Alain Danielou |pages=96 |publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Company |isbn=0-89281-354-7 |year=1991 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=1HMXN9h6WX0C}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=A Talaqdar of Oudh|title=The Matsya Puranam: Part I|series=The Sacred books of the Hindus|volume=18|year=2008|publisher=Cosmo Publications|isbn=978-81-307-0532-3|page=32|chapter=XI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Markandeya Purana'' further adds he was assigned the duty as chief of Guhyakas by Surya and to protect mortals "amid the terrors of forests and other lonely places, of great conflagration, of enemies and robbers." Sometimes, Revanta is depicted as combating robbers in reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Religious Beliefs and Practices of North India During the Early Mediaeval Period |author=Vibhuti Bhushan Mishra |year=1973 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-03610-5 |page=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tale from the ''[[Devi Bhagavata Purana]]'' has a passing reference to Revanta. Once when Revanta – riding on the seven headed horse [[Uchaishravas]] – went to [[Vishnu]]'s abode, Vishnu's wife [[Lakshmi]] was mesmerized with the horse and ignored a question asked by Vishnu. Thus, she was cursed by her husband to become a mare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Women, androgynes, and other mythical beasts |first=Wendy |last=Doniger O'Flaherty |page=218 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-61850-1 |year=1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Revanta.jpg|thumb|11th century statue of Revanta from Bengal]]
Markandeya Purana describes Revanta as "holding a sword and bow, clad in an armour, riding on horseback, and carrying arrows and a quiver".&lt;ref name="Singh 2606"&gt;{{harvnb|Singh|1997|p=2606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalika Purana describes him carrying a sword in right hand and a whip in his left, seated on a white horse. Thus he is called ''Haya-[[Vahana]]'', one who rides a horse. [[Varahamihira]] describes him as accompanied by attendants for hunting.&lt;ref name="Singh 2606"/&gt;

In sculpture, Revanta is often depicted with the Guhyakas, whose chief he is, in scenes of hunting. Apart from the attributes described in texts like the sword, bow; he sometimes also carries a cup of wine in his hand. Revanta is often depicted wearing long [[Boot|boots]] reaching up to the calves, unlike other Hindu divinities – except Surya – who are depicted barefoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh|1997|pp=2611, 2613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Art of Osian Temples: Socio-Economic and Religious Life in India, 8th-12th Centuries A.D. |first=Asha |last=Kalia |year=1982 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn=0-391-02558-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/artofosiantemple00kali/page/119 119–120] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/artofosiantemple00kali/page/119 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Revanta is depicted seated on a horse and accompanied by a hunting dog. Revanta's attendants are depicted with various hunting weapons like lances and swords. Some of them are shown blowing a [[conch]] or beaming [[drum]]s or holding an umbrella over the head of their lord, the umbrella being the symbol of royalty.&lt;ref name = "Zoroastrianism"&gt;''A History of Zoroastrianism'' by Mary Boyce, Frantz Grenet, Roger Beck pp.485-6&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some of them are depicted as flying or holding wine or water jars. Sometimes, an attendant carries a dead boar in his shoulder or the dog chasing a boar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh|1997|pp=2606–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==

Revanta was worshipped as guardian deity of warriors and horses, protector from the dangers of forests and the patron god of hunting.&lt;ref name = "Zoroastrianism"/&gt; The worship of Revanta is closely associated with [[Saura (Hinduism)|Saura]], cult of Surya. Often, scriptures like [[Vishnudharmottara Purana]] and [[Kalika Purana]] recommend worship of Revanta alongside Surya or according to the rituals of [[Sun worship]].&lt;ref name="Singh 2606"/&gt; [[Shabha-kalpa-druma]] records Revanta's worship after Surya's, in the Hindu month of [[Ashvin]] by warriors.&lt;ref name="Singh 2607"&gt;{{harvnb|Singh|1997|pp=2607}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nakula]], the fourth [[Pandava]], is believed to have written ''Ashavashastram'' on horses. He suggests worship of Raivata to protect horses from ghosts.&lt;ref name="Singh 2607"/&gt;

The worship of Revanta was popular in the early-mediaeval period, particularly in [[Rajasthan]]. Revanta is mostly depicted in [[Vaishnava]] and Surya temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh|1997|p=2609}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a stone inscription that talks about a temple to Revanta, as the principal deity, in Vikranapur (modern [[Kotgaph]], [[Madhya Pradesh]]) built by the [[Kalachuris of Ratnapura|Kalachuri]] king [[Ratnadeva]] II.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh|1997|pp=2615–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Saivism}}
'''Nandi''' ({{lang-sa|नन्दि}}), also known as '''Nandikeshwara''' or '''Nandideva''', is the [[bull]] [[vahana]] of the [[Hindu god]] [[Shiva]]. He is also the [[Dvarapala|guardian]] deity of [[Mount Kailash|Kailash]], the abode of Shiva. Almost all Shiva temples display stone-images of a seated Nandi, generally facing the main shrine.

According to [[Saivism|Saivite]] [[Shaiva Siddhanta|siddhantic]] tradition, he is considered as the chief [[guru]] of eight disciples of [[Nandinatha Sampradaya]], namely, [[Four Kumaras|Sanaka, Sanatana, Sanandana]], [[Sanatkumara]], [[Tirumular]], [[Vyagrapada]], [[Patanjali]], and Sivayoga Muni, who were sent in eight different directions, to spread the wisdom.&lt;ref name="sivay"&gt;{{cite book | author=Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami|date=2003|title=Dancing with Siva: Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism|publisher=Himalayan Academy Publications|ISBN=978-0-945497-89-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hinduism in Vietnam|Cham Hindus of Vietnam]] believes that when they die, the [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] will come and take their soul to the holy land of India from Vietnam.

The Sanskrit word nandi ({{lang-sa|नन्दि}}) has the meaning of happy, joy, and satisfaction, the properties of divine guardian of Shiva- Nandi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/tamil/recherche | title=Monier Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary | access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is recently documented, that the application of the name Nandi to the bull (Sanskrit: ''Vṛṣabha''), is in fact a development of recent [[syncretism]] of different regional beliefs within Saivism.&lt;ref&gt;Gouriswar Bhattacharya, (1977), "Nandin and Vṛṣabha", ''Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft'', Supplement III,2, XIX. Deutscher Orientalistentag,  pp. 1543–1567.&lt;/ref&gt; The name Nandi was widely used instead for an anthropomorphic [[Dvarapala|door-keeper]] of Kailasha, rather than his mount, in the oldest Saivite texts in Sanskrit, Tamil, and other Indian languages. [[Shaiva Siddhanta|Siddhantic]] texts clearly distinct Nandi from ''Vṛṣabha''. According to them, [[Parvati|Devi]], [[Chandeshvara Nayanar|Chandesha]], [[Mahākāla|Mahakala]], Vṛṣabha, Nandi, [[Ganesha]], [[Bhringi]], and [[Murugan]], are the eight Ganeshwaras (commanders) of Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sabaratnam Sivacharyar|first1=Dr.S.P.|title=Shrimat Kamigagamah Purva Pada (Part One)|publisher=The Himalayan Academy, Kauai Adheenam|location=USA|pages=4:471–500|url=http://www.himalayanacademy.com/view/kamika-agama-purva-pada-part-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and legends ==
 
Nandi is described as the son of the sage Shilada. Shilada underwent severe penance to have a boon– a child with immortality and blessings of Lord Shiva, and received Nandi as his son. Legends say that Nandi was born from a [[Yajna]] performed by the Shilada. Nandi grew as an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva and he performed severe penance  to become his gate-keeper, as well as his mount, on the banks of river [[Narmada River|Narmada]], near Tripur Tirth Kshetra in present-day Nandikeshwar Temple, in [[Jabalpur]], [[Madhya Pradesh]].

Nandi got the divine-knowledge of [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamic]] and [[Tantra|Tantric]] wisdom taught by Shiva, from goddess [[Parvati]]. He could teach that divine-knowledge to his eight disciples, who are identified as the progenitors of [[Nandinatha Sampradaya]], namely, [[Four Kumaras|Sanaka, Sanatana, Sanandana]], [[Sanatkumara]], [[Tirumular]], [[Vyagrapada]], [[Patanjali]], and Sivayoga Muni. These eight disciples were sent in eight different directions of the world by Nandi, to spread this knowledge.&lt;ref name="sivay" /&gt;

Many other puranic tales are available about Nandi. One describes his conflict with [[Ravana]], the antagonist of [[Ramayana]]. Nandi cursed Ravana (the demon King of [[Lanka]]), that his kingdom would be burnt by a forest-dweller monkey ([[Vanara]]), since he behaved in a restless manner, just like a monkey,while waiting to meet [[Shiva]].

The ancient Tamil text ''[[Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam]]'' mentions another story in which Nandi is [[incarnate]]d as a whale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ge5ZAAAAMAAJ | title=The Indian Journal of English Studies, Volume 34 | publisher=Orient Longmans | author=Indian Association for English Studies | pages=92| year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It says that Parvati lost her concentration while Shiva was explaining the meaning of ''[[Vedas]]'' to her. Parvati, then incarnated as a fisher-woman to atone for her lack of concentration. To unite his master and his beloved-wife, Nandi took the form of a whale and started to trouble the people. Fisher-woman Parvati's father declared that the man who would kill the whale would marry his daughter. Later, Shiva took the form of a fisherman and killed the whale, and received Parvati in her previous form.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

[[Āgama (Hinduism)|''Agamas'']] describe him in a zoo-anthropomorphic form, with the head of bull and four hands, with [[antelope]], axe, mace, and [[abhayamudra]]. In his mount form, Nandi is depicted as a seated bull in all Shiva temples, all over the world.

The white color of the bull symbolizes purity and justice. Symbolically, the seated Nandi faces the sanctum in Shiva temples and represents an individual [[Ātman (Hinduism)|jiva]] (soul) and the message that the jiva should always be focused on the [[Parameshwara (god)|Parameshwara]]. From the yogic perspective, Nandi is the mind dedicated to Shiva, the absolute.

'''Kama''' ({{lang-sa|कामदेव}}, {{IAST3|Kāmadeva}}), also known as '''Kamadeva''' and '''Manmatha''', is the [[Hindu]] god of erotic love, desire and pleasure, often portrayed alongside his consort and female counterpart, [[Rati]]. He is depicted as a handsome young man decked with ornaments and flowers, armed with a bow of sugarcane and shooting arrows of flowers.&lt;ref name="Sanford2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sanford, A.W. |year=2005 |title=Shifting the Center: Yakṣas on the Margins of Contemporary Practice |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=89–110 |doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfi005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Atharvaveda|Atharva Veda]] regards Kamadeva as the wielder of the creative power of the universe, also describing him to have been "born at first, him neither the gods nor the fathers ever equalled".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Webster |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S89fgAUG2AEC&amp;dq=Kamadeva+atharva+veda&amp;pg=PA56 |title=The Philosophy of Desire in the Buddhist Pali Canon |date=2004-12-31 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-27941-8 |pages=56 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mentioned as a ''[[manasputra]]'' (mind-born son) of the creator god [[Brahma]] in the ''[[Puranas]]'', Kamadeva's most popular legend is his story of incineration by [[Shiva]]'s third eye while the latter was meditating, later embodied on earth as the eldest son of [[Krishna]] and his chief consort [[Rukmini]], [[Pradyumna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hudson |first=D.

==Etymology and other names==
The name ''Kama-deva'' ({{IAST3|kāma-deva}}) can be translated as 'god of love'. ''Deva'' means heavenly or divine, and refers to a deity in [[Hinduism]]. ''Kama'' ({{IAST3|kāma}}) means "desire" or "longing", especially as in sensual or sexual love. The name is used in [[Rig Veda]] ([[Mandala 9|RV 9]], 113. 11).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Kamadeva is a name of [[Vishnu]] in [[Vishnu Purana]] and [[Bhagavata Purana]] (SB 5.18.15), and also [[Krishna]] as well as [[Shiva]]. ''Kama'' is also a name used for [[Agni]] ([[Atharvaveda|Atharva Veda]] 6.36.3).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Atharva Veda: Book 6: Hymn 36: In praise of Agni Vaisvānara|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/av/av06036.htm|access-date=2022-02-15|website=www.sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth===
[[File:Thewakamnoet (1959, p. 137).jpg|thumb|left|A Thai depiction of Kamadeva riding a parrot, 1959]]
The story of the birth of Kamadeva has several variants in different Hindu scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benton|2006|loc=p. 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Taittiriya Brahmana]]'' and the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', he is mentioned as a son of [[Yama (Hinduism)#Identification with Dharmadeva|Dharma]], the god of righteousness and a ''prajapati'' (agent of creation).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01067.htm Adi Parva, Chapter 66, Verses 31-33]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "VM2"&gt;{{cite book

According to [[Purana|''Puranic'' scriptures]] including the ''[[Shiva Purana]]'', the ''[[Kalika Purana]]'', the ''[[Brahma Vaivarta Purana]]'' and the ''[[Matsya Purana]]'', Kama is one of the [[Manasputra|mind-born sons]] of the creator god [[Brahma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benton|2006|loc=p. 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benton|2006|loc=p. 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "SK" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chandra" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "SS2" /&gt; In the most common narrative, after Brahma creates all the [[prajapati]]s (agents of creations) and a maiden named Sandhya, an extremely handsome and youthful man emerges from his mind and enquires Brahma about the purpose of his birth. Brahma names him Kama and orders him to spread love in the world by shooting his flower-arrows. Kama decides to first use his arrows against Brahma and shoots him with his floral arrows.{{efn|In the ''Kalika Purana'', Kama also shoots at the ''prajapatis'', and later from the sweat of [[Daksha]], [[Rati]] emerges.&lt;ref name = "VM2" /&gt;}} He becomes attracted to Sandhya and desires for her. The ''prajapati'' Dharma becomes worried by this and calls the god [[Shiva]], who watches them and laughs at both Brahma and Kama.{{efn|In some versions, the role of Dharma is absent. Instead, Shiva sees them while traveling there.&lt;ref name = "SS2" /&gt;}} Brahma regains consciousness and curses Kama to be burnt to ashes by Shiva in the future. However, on Kama's pleading, Brahma assures him that he would be reborn.&lt;ref name = "SS2" &gt;{{Cite book |last=Santideva |first=Sadhu |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUFZ9XzzHAcC&amp;dq=k%C4%81ma+brahm%C4%81&amp;pg=PA112 |title=Ascetic Mysticism |date=2000 |publisher=Cosmo Publications |isbn=978-81-7020-998-0 |pages=111–117 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "VM2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benton|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "SK" /&gt;{{efn|In some texts like the ''Matsya Purana'' and ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'', a different name is used for Sandhya.&lt;ref name = "SS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "SK" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "VM2" /&gt;}} A later version of the myth is found in the ''[[Skanda Purana]],'' according to which, Brahma creates Kama from his mind to ignite passion in the ''prajapatis'' (agents of creation) after they refused to procreate.&lt;ref name = "SK" &gt;{{Cite book |last=Kramrisch |first=S. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5BanndcIgUC&amp;dq=k%C4%81ma+god&amp;pg=PA218 |title=The Presence of Siva |date=1981 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-01930-7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In this version, Kama is cursed by Brahma as he initially ignores his orders.&lt;ref name = "SS2" /&gt;}}

In some traditions, Kama is considered a son of the goddess of wealth [[Lakshmi]] and the preserver god [[Vishnu]] due to his birth as [[Pradyumna]] to [[Rukmini]] and [[Krishna]], the incarnations of Lakshmi and Vishnu respectively.&lt;ref name = "WW" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning By Eva Rudy Jansen p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chandra" /&gt; According to ''Matsya Purana'', Visnu-Krishna and Kamadeva have a historical relationship.&lt;ref name="Sanford2002" /&gt;

===Family and assistants===
Both the epics and the ''[[Puranas]]'' attest the goddess [[Rati]] as the consort and chief assistant of Kamadeva. She is his female counterpart representing sensual pleasure. According to ''[[Kalika Purana]]'' and ''[[Shiva Purana]]'', she emerged from a sweat drop of ''prajapati'' [[Daksha]] who was assigned by [[Brahma]] to present Kamadeva a wife. The ''Shiva Purana'' also mentions that Kama himself was pierced by his love-arrows when he saw Rati. The ''[[Brahmavaivarta Purana]]'' gives Rati another origin, according to which Sandhya died after [[Brahma]] desired for her but was revived as Rati by [[Vishnu]] who presented her to Kama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benton|2006|loc=p. 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benton|2006|loc=p. 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Priti (goddess)|Priti]] ("affection") is mentioned as Kamadeva's second spouse in the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'', while in other texts, 'Priti' is just an epithet of Rati.&lt;ref name = "Chandra" /&gt;

In the most scriptures, Kama and Rati have two children, Harsha ("Joy") and Yashas ("Grace"). However, the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' mentions that they only has one son – Harsha.&lt;ref name = "Hop" /&gt;

Besides Rati, Kama's main assistant is Vasanta, the god of spring season, who was created by Brahma. Kama is served by a group of violent ''[[gana]]s'' known as the Maras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benton|2006|loc=p. 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chandra" /&gt;Kama also leads the celestial nymphs, the [[apsaras]], and they are often sent by [[Indra]]—the king of heaven—to disturb the penance of sages to prevent them from achieving divine powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benton|2006|loc=p. 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incineration by Shiva===
[[File:Madan-Bhasma (Shiva Turns to Ashes).jpg|thumb|Madan-Bhasma (Shiva Turns Kama to Ashes)]]
One of the principal myths regarding Kama is that of his incineration by [[Shiva]], the ''Madana-bhasma'' (Kama Dahana). It occurs in its most developed form in the [[Matsya Purana]] (verses 227–255)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; but is also repeated with variants in the [[Shiva Purana|Shaiva Purana]] and
other Puranas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Klaus Klostermaier]], (2000) Hinduism: A Short History. Oxford: One World Publications.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the narrative, [[Indra]] and the gods are suffering at the hands of the demon [[Tarakasura]] who cannot be defeated except by Shiva's son. [[Brahma]] advises that [[Parvati]] should do sacred pooja with lord Shiva, since their offspring would be able to defeat Taraka. Indra assigns Kamadeva to break Shiva's meditation. To create a congenial atmosphere, Kamadeva (Madana) creates an untimely spring (''akāla-vasanta''). He evades Shiva's guard, [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]]n, by taking the form of the fragrant southern breeze, and enters Shiva's abode.

After he awakens Shiva with a flower arrow, Shiva, furious, opens his third eye, which incinerates Madana instantaneously and he is turned into ash. However, Shiva observes Parvati and asks her how he can help her. She enjoins him to resuscitate Madana, and Shiva agrees to let Madana live but in a disembodied form; hence Kamadeva is also called ''Ananga'' (an- = without; anga = body, "bodiless"), or ''Atanu'' (''a''- = without; ''tanu'' = body). The spirit of love embodied by Kama is now disseminated across the cosmos: afflicting humanity with the creation of a different atmosphere. Lord Shiva agrees with Mother Parvati's proposal and their pooja results the  birth of Lord Karthikeya. Their son [[Kartikeya]] goes on to defeat Taraka.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty]], (1975) Hindu Myths: A Sourcebook Translated from the Sanskrit.

===Incarnations===

According to [[Garuda Purana]], [[Pradyumna]] and [[Samba (Krishna's son)|Samba]] - the sons of [[Krishna]], [[Four Kumaras|Sanat Kumara]] - the son of [[Brahma]], [[Kartikeya|Skanda]] - the son of [[Shiva]], [[Sudarshana]] (the presiding deity of Sudarshana Chakra), and [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Bharata]] are all incarnations of Kama.&lt;ref name="Motilal Banarsidass"&gt;{{cite book |author1=J.L.

The religious rituals addressed to him offer a means of purification and re-entry into the community. Devotion to Kamadeva keeps desire within the framework of the [[dharma|religious tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benton|2006|loc=p. 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamadeva appears in many stories and becomes the object of devotional rituals for those seeking health, physical beauty, husbands, wives, and sons. In one story{{Where|date=December 2016}} Kamadeva himself succumbs to desire, and must then worship his lover in order to be released from this passion and its curse.

===In Gaudiya Vaishnavism===
In the [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] tradition, [[Krishna]] is identified as the original Kamadeva in [[Vrindavana]]. Kamadeva also incarnates as Krishna's son [[Samba (Krishna's son)|Shamba]] after being burned down by [[Shiva]]. Since he was begotten by Krishna himself, his qualities were similar to those of Krishna, such as his colour, appearance, and attributes.&lt;ref name=Prabhupada1972&gt;{{cite book

 | title = Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
 |page = Ch. 55: Shaba was Born to Kṛṣṇa and Jambabati
| title-link = Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This Shamba is not considered identical with [[Vishnu]]'s [[vyuha]]-manifestation called Shamba, but is an individual soul (''[[jiva]]-tattva'') who, owing to his celestial powers, becomes an emanation of [[Vishnu]]'s prowess.

The Kamadeva that was incinerated is believed to be a celestial [[demigod]] capable of inducing love and lusty desires. He is distinguished from the spiritual Kamadeva.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt; Here [[Krishna]] is the source of Kamadeva's inciting power, the ever-fresh [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] god of love of [[Vrindavana]], the origin of all forms of Kamadeva, yet above mundane love, who is worshiped with the Kama-Gayatri and Kama-Bija [[mantra]]s.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;&lt;ref name=CC&gt;''vṛndāvane aprākṛta navīna madana, kāma-gāyatrī kāma-bīje yāṅra upāsana'' (Caitanya Caritamrita, 2.8.138)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miller1980&gt;{{cite journal

When Kamadeva is referenced as ''smara'' in ''Bhāgavata Purāṇa'' (book 10) in the context of the supramundane love between Krishna and the [[gopi]]s (cowherd maidens), he is not the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]] who incites lusty feelings.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt; The word ''smara'' rather refers to Krishna himself, who through the medium of his [[bansuri|flute]] increases his influence on the devoted [[gopi]]s. The symptoms of this ''smarodayam'' (lit. "arousal of desire") experienced by the [[gopi]]s have been described in a commentary (by [[Vishvanatha Cakravarti]]) as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhagavata Purana]] 10.21.3 Tika, “''caksu-ragah prathamam cittasangas tata ‘tha sankalpah nidra-cchedas tanuta visaya-nivrittis trapanasah / unmado muriccha mrtir ity etah smara-dasa dasaiva syuh.”&lt;/ref&gt; "First comes attraction expressed through the eyes, then intense attachment in the mind, then determination, loss of sleep, becoming emaciated, uninterested in external things, shamelessness, madness, becoming stunned, and death.

==Temples==
While it is believed that there are no temples to Kamadeva, and no [[murti]]s (statues) of Kamadeva are sold for worship on the market,&lt;ref name=Benton2&gt;{{cite book
 | author = Benton, C.
 | year = 2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet there is an ancient temple of [[Madan Kamdev]] in Baihata Chariali, Kamrup district in [[Assam]]. Madan is the brother of Kamadeva. The ruins of Madan Kamdev are scattered widely in a secluded place, covering 500 meters.

Some other temples dedicated or related to this [[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]:
*Kameshwara Temple, in [[Aragalur]]. The [[Purana#Sthala Puranas|Sthala purana]] indicates that Kamadeva woke up [[Shiva]] at this place.

In Hindu tradition, the theonym ''Váruṇa'' ([[Devanagari]]: [[wikt:वरुण#Sanskrit|वरुण]]) is described as a derivation from the verbal root ''vṛ'' ("to surround, to cover" or "to restrain, bind") by means of a suffixal ''-uṇa-'', for an interpretation of the name as  "he who covers or binds", in reference to the cosmological [[Oceanus|ocean or river]] encircling the world, but also in reference to the "binding" by universal law or ''[[Ṛta]]''.&lt;ref name="Snodgrass1992p121" /&gt;

[[Georges Dumézil]] (1934) made a cautious case for the identity of Varuna and the Greek god ''[[Uranus (mythology)|Ouranos]]'' at the earliest [[Indo-European mythology|Indo-European]] cultural level.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil, ''Ouranós-Váruna: Étude de mythologie comparée indo-européenne'' (Paris:Maisonneuve 1932).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dumézil"&gt;Georges Dumézil, ''Ouranos-Varuna – Essai de mythologie comparée indo-européenne'' (Paris: G.-P.

The etymological identification of the name ''Ouranos'' with the Sanskrit ''Varuṇa'' is based in the derivation of both names from the [[PIE root]] ''*ŭer'' with a sense of "binding" – the Indic king-god ''Varuṇa'' binds the wicked, the Greek king-god ''Ouranos'' binds the Cyclopes. This derivation of the Greek name is now widely rejected in favour of derivation from the root  *''wers-'' "to moisten, drip" (Sanskrit vṛṣ "to rain, pour").&lt;ref&gt;[[Manfred Mayrhofer]], ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen'', vol. 2, s.v.

In ''Vajasaneyi Samhita'' 21.40 (''[[Yajurveda]]''), Varuna is called the patron deity of physicians, one who has "a hundred, a thousand remedies".&lt;ref name="Srinivasan1997p48" /&gt; His capacity and association with "all comprehensive knowledge" is also found in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' (~1000 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Srinivasan |first=Doris |title=The Religious Significance of Divine Multiple Body Parts in the Atharva Veda |journal=Numen |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |volume=25 |issue=3 |year=1978 |doi=10.1163/156852778x00245 |pages=198–200, context: 193–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varuna also finds a mention in the early [[Upanishad]]s, where his role evolves.

=== Upanishads ===
Varuna, addressed as Varuni explained [[Brahman]] in [[Taittiriya]] Upanishad to sage [[Bhrigu]]. First six anuvakas of Bhrigu Valli are called ''Bhargavi Varuni Vidya'', which means "the knowledge Bhrigu got from (his father) Varuni". It is in these anuvakas that sage Varuni advises Bhrigu with one of the oft-cited definition of Brahman, as "that from which beings originate, through which they live, and in which they re-enter after death, explore that because that is Brahman".&lt;ref name="pauldeussen311"&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 241-246&lt;/ref&gt; This thematic, all encompassing, eternal nature of reality and existence develops as the basis for Bhrigu's emphasis on introspection, to help peel off the outer husks of knowledge, in order to reach and realize the innermost kernel of spiritual Self-knowledge.&lt;ref name="pauldeussen311" /&gt;

=== Ramayana ===
[[File:Rama-Varuna.jpg|thumb|Varuna himself arose from the depth of the ocean and begged Rama for forgiveness.]]
Rama interacts with Varuna in the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]''. For example, faced with the dilemma of how to cross the ocean to [[Lanka]], where his abducted wife [[Sita]] is held captive by the demon king [[Ravana]], [[Rama]] (an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]]) performs a ''pravpavesha'' (prayer, [[tapasya]]) to Varuna, the Lord of Oceans, for three days and three nights, states Ramesh Menon.&lt;ref name="Menon2004p376" /&gt; Varuna does not respond, and Rama arises on the fourth morning, enraged. He states to his brother Lakshamana that "even lords of the elements listen only to violence, Varuna does not respect gentleness, and peaceful prayers go unheard".&lt;ref name="Menon2004p376"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ramesh Menon |title=The Ramayana: A Modern Retelling of the Great Indian Epic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEEXjAagUzsC |year=2004 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-1-4668-2625-0 |pages=376–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his bow and arrow, Rama prepares to attack the oceans to dry up the waters and create a bed of sand for his army of monkeys to cross and thus confront Ravana. Lakshmana appeals to Rama, translates Menon, that he should return to "peaceful paths of our fathers, you can win this war without laying waste the sea".&lt;ref name="Menon2004p376" /&gt; Rama shoots his weapon sending the ocean into flames. As Rama increases the ferocity of his weapons, Varuna arises out of the oceans. He bows to Rama, stating that he himself did not know how to help Rama because the sea is deep, vast and he cannot change the nature of sea. Varuna asked Rama to remember that he is "the soul of peace and love, wrath does not suit him". Varuna promised to Rama that he will not disturb him or his army as they build a bridge and cross over to Lanka. Although, most of the sources claim it was [[Samudra]], the god of the oceans who met Rama not the water god Varuna.&lt;ref name="Menon2004p376" /&gt;

The [[Tolkāppiyam]], a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] grammar work from 3rd century BCE divides the people of ancient [[Tamilakam]] into five [[Sangam landscape]] divisions: ''kurinji, mullai, paalai, marutham'' and ''neithal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uP7LHS3cDMC&amp;q=sangam+landscape&amp;pg=PT124 |title=Tamil Oratory and the Dravidian Aesthetic: Democratic Practice in South India |last=Bate |first=Bernard |date=2010-06-01 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-51940-3 |pages=100 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each landscape is designated with different gods.

== Beyond Hinduism and India ==

=== Sri Lankan Tamils ([[Karaiyar]] caste) ===

Karaiyar is a Sri Lankan Tamil caste found mainly on the northern and eastern coastal areas of Sri Lanka, and globally among the Tamil diaspora.
They are traditionally a seafaring community that is engaged in fishing, shipment and seaborne trade. They fish mostly in deep seas, and employ gillnet and seine fishing methods. The Karaiyars were the major maritime traders and boat owners who among other things, traded with pearls, chanks, tobacco, and shipped goods overseas to countries such as India, Myanmar and Indonesia. The community known for their maritime history, are also reputed as a warrior caste who contributed as army and navy soldiers of Tamil kings. They were noted as the army generals and navy captains of the Aryacakravarti dynasty. The Karaiyars emerged in the 1980s as strong representatives of Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism. The nuclear leadership of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have background in the wealthier enterprising section of the Karaiyars.

The word "Karaiyar" is derived from the [[Tamil language]] words ''karai'' ("coast" or "shore") and ''yar'' ("people").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dravidian Linguistics Association|title=International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics|date=1990|publisher=Department of Linguistics, University of Kerala.|pages=110|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Kareoi'' mentioned by 2nd century AD writer [[Ptolemy]], is identified with the Tamil word "Karaiyar".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vhIAAAAIAAJ|title=The History of the Pearl Fishery of the Tamil Coast|last=Arunachalam|first=S.|date=1952|publisher=Ananamalai University|pages=34|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese and Dutch sources mentions them under the term ''Careas'', ''Careaz'', or ''Carias,'' which are terms denoting "Karaiyar".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Buddhism ===

====Theravada====

The [[Pali Canon]] of the [[Theravada]] school recognizes Varuṇa (Sanskrit; Pali: Varuna) as a king of the devas and companion of [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Sakka]], [[Prajapati|Pajāpati]] and [[Ishana|Isāna]]. In the battle against the [[Asura (Buddhism)|Asuras]], the devas of [[Trāyastriṃśa|Tāvatiṃsa]] were asked to look upon the banner of Varuna in order to have all their fears dispelled (S.i.219).

The [[Tevijja Sutta]] mentions him among [[Indra]], [[Soma (deity)|Soma]], [[Ishana|Isāna]], [[Prajapati|Pajāpati]], [[Yama]] and [[Mahiddhi]] as gods that are invoked by the [[brahmins]].

The [[Atanatiya Sutta|Ātānātiya Sutta]] lists him among the [[Yaksha|Yakkha]] chiefs.

Buddhaghosa states (SA.i.262) that Varuna is equal in age and glory (vanna) with Sakka and takes the third seat in the assembly of devas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Varuna |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/varuna#buddhism |website=Wisdom Library |date=June 2008 |access-date=2019-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sui Ten Varna TOJI12TEN.JPG|thumb|Painting of Varuna ([[Kyoto]], [[Japan]])]]

In [[East Asian Buddhism]], Varuna is a [[dharmapāla]] and often classed as one of the [[Twelve Devas]] (Japanese: [[:ja:十二天|Jūniten]], 十二天). He presides over the western direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emuseum.jp/detail/100031/000/000?mode=detail&amp;d_lang=en Twelve Heavenly Deities (Devas)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201634/http://www.emuseum.jp/detail/100031/000/000?mode=detail&amp;d_lang=en |date=2016-03-04 }} Nara National Museum, Japan&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, he is called "Suiten" (水天 lit. "water [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]"). He is included with the other eleven devas, which include Taishakuten ([[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra/Indra]]), Fūten ([[Vāyu]]), Emmaten ([[Yama]]), Rasetsuten ([[Nirṛti (god)|Nirṛti]]/[[Rakshasa|Rākṣasa]]), Ishanaten ([[Ishana|Īśāna]]), Bishamonten ([[Vaiśravaṇa|Vaiśravaṇa/Kubera]]), Katen ([[Agni]]), Bonten ([[Brahmā]]), Jiten ([[Pṛthivī]]), Nitten ([[Sūrya|Sūrya/Āditya]]), and Gatten ([[Chandra]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=juuniten 十二天 |url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/j/juuniten.htm |website=JAANUS |access-date=23 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shinto ===

[[File:Tokyo Suitengu 201604a.jpg|thumb|left|[[Suitengū (Tokyo)]] is a [[Shinto shrine]] to Varuna.]]

Varuna is also worshipped in Japan's [[Shinto]] religion. One of the Shinto shrines dedicated to him is the [[Suitengū (Tokyo)|''Suitengū'']] ("Palace of Suiten") in [[Tokyo]]. After the Japanese emperor issued the ''[[Shinbutsu bunri]]'', the separation of Shinto and Buddhist practices as part of the [[Meiji Restoration]], Varuna/Suiten was identified with the Japanese supreme God, [[Amenominakanushi]].&lt;ref&gt;"Tokyo Suitengu monogatari" 1985 Kodansha, {{ISBN|406202117X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life ==
[[File:Anirudha,_holding_a_sword_and_a_shield,_in_the_Kondamotu_Vrishni_heroes_relief,_4th_century_CE.jpg|alt=|291x291px|thumb|Aniruddha, holding a sword and a shield, in the Kondamotu Vrishni heroes relief, 4th-century CE.&lt;ref name="VVG74"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gupta |first1=Vinay K. |title=Vrishnis in Ancient Literature and Art |journal=Indology's Pulse Arts in Context, Doris Meth Srinivasan Festschrift Volume, Eds.

Anirudha was born to Pradyumna and [[Rukmavati]]. He was the grandson of [[Krishna]] and [[Rukmini]]. His mother [[Rukmavati]] was the daughter of [[Rukmi]], the king of Vidarbha. He was also one of the few Maharathis (incredibly strong warriors) of his dynasty. His early life and marriage to his first wife, Rochana, are described in the [[Bhagavata Purana]], Canto 10, Chapter 61.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Srimad Bhagavatam: Canto 10 - Chapter 61|url=http://bhagavata.org/canto10/chapter61.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Bhagavata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriages ==

=== Marriage to Rochana ===
Aniruddha's marriage to Rochana is described in the 61st Chapter of the 10th Canto of the [[Bhagavata Purana]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the behest of his sister [[Rukmini]], [[Rukmi]] requested Krishna to have Aniruddha marry Rochana, after the wedding ceremony, Rukmi was killed by [[Balarama]] after the former cheated the latter in a game of dice and insulted his Yadava heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Srimad Bhagavatam: Canto 10 - Chapter 61 |url=http://bhagavata.org/canto10/chapter61.html |access-date=2022-07-11 |website=bhagavata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Great War and Marriage to Usha ===
According to the [[Bhagavata Purana|Srimad Bhagavatam]], a [[daitya]] princess named [[Uṣā|Usha]], a daughter of [[Banasura]] (also referred to as Bana), fell in love with Aniruddha after seeing him in her dream and making love to him.

Banasura, ruling his kingdom from the city of Sonitapura, was the son of [[Mahabali|Bali]] and the grandson of [[Prahlada]]. Banasura was a great devotee of [[Shiva]] and as a result of a boon granted to him from the deity, had gained 1000 arms. Intoxicated by his prowess, he observed to Shiva that he was the latter's equal, and that he had attempted to fight elephants, but the creatures had grown terrified of him. Shiva, enraged by his words, spoke thus: 'Your flag will be broken, oh fool, when your pride is vanquished in a battle you have with someone like me.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Srimad Bhagavatam: Canto 10 - Chapter 62 |url=http://bhagavata.org/canto10/chapter62.html |access-date=2022-07-11 |website=bhagavata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File: Raja Ravi Varma, Usha's Dream (oleographic print).jpg|thumb|left|Usha dreaming of Aniruddha]]

As per the artistic description of Usha's dream, [[Chitralekha (deity)|Chitralekha]] (In Sanskrit, ''artist''), her friend, drew pictures of many [[Vrishni heroes|Vrishnis]] using her special abilities. Usha recognised Aniruddha's picture among all of them. Chitralekha, with her yogic powers and Anima Siddhi, shrunk the son of Pradyumna to the size of a doll and brought him to Usha's palace. She worshipped him and furnished him with priceless garments, garlands, fragrances, lamps, and with beverages, dishes, and words. Breaking her vow of chastity with him, she kept him hidden in her maiden quarters, and the lovers lost track of the days. Catching wind of his daughter's activities, Banasura rushed to her chambers to find her playing dice with doll sized Aniruddha. Even as the prince fended off the guards, Banasura subdued him with the mystical ropes of [[Varuna]] due to Aniruddha's shrunken state. Usha was overwhelmed with sorrow due to this incident. Aniruddha was held captive by Banasura for a month, until Narada informed the Yadus in Dvaraka, who were searching for Aniruddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Srimad Bhagavatam: Canto10 - Chapter 62|url=http://bhagavata.org/canto10/chapter62.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Bhagavata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yadus' army attacked Banasura in a great battle. When the Yadu princes and their army besieged his kingdom with 12 [[Akshauhini|akshauhinis]], surrounding it completely, [[Banasura]] staged a fierce counterattack. During the war, [[Shiva]] appeared on the battlefield, riding on Nandi, to protect his devotee, Banasura. Balarama fought against Banasura's commander, while Samba fought against Banasura's son. To bear witness, the leaders of the godly souls headed by Brahma came in their celestial vehicles, as also the sages, the perfected souls, and the venerable personalities, the singers and [[Apsara|apsaras]] of heaven, and the [[Yakshini|yakshinis]]. Krishna and Shiva faced each other. Krishna used a ''brahmastra'' against Shiva's ''brahmastra'', a mountain weapon against a wind weapon, a rain weapon against a fire weapon, and His ''narayanastra'' against Shiva's ''pasupatiastra''. After duelling with [[Satyaki]], Bana took up arms against [[Krishna]]. However, Krishna blew his conch and instantly, Banasura's charioteer was killed and his chariot broken and shattered.

In a desperate attempt to save Banasura, Kothara, his mother, stood naked before Krishna with her hair dishevelled. When the deity looked away, the asura fled to the city. When Shiva's forces had been defeated, Jvara, the embodiment of Shiva's fever, bearing three heads and three feet, attacked Krishna with scorching heat. Krishna produced his own Jvara of frigid coldness, and the two fought each other. Overwhelmed by Vishnu's fever, Shiva's Jvara offered its surrender and obeisance to Krishna and departed.

Meanwhile, Balarama defeated Banasura's commander. Bana rode forth upon his chariot to fight with Krishna, and the fought back with his [[Sudarshana Chakra]]. When Krishna started chopping Banasura's arms, [[Shiva]] returned to his senses and extolled the glories of [[Krishna]], and urged him not to kill Banasura, whom he had bestowed with fearlessness. Obliging, Krishna replied that he had never intended to kill Banasura, since he was the son of Bali and the grandson of the devout [[Prahlada]]. Vishnu had promised Bali not to kill any member of his family, and therefore would not slay him. However, Krishna severed Banasura's extra arms to destroy the latter's pride, leaving Banasura with only four arms.

Banasura realised his mistake and bowed his head before Krishna, arranging for a chariot to seat Aniruddha and Usha for their wedding in Dvaraka.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Srimad Bhagavatam: Canto 10 - Chapter 63|url=http://bhagavata.org/canto10/chapter63.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Bhagavata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boar Aspect==
[[File:The God Vishnu in Three Incarnations. Northern India (Mathura), Gupta period, mid-5th century AD. Boston Museum.jpg|thumb|Aniruddha appears as a boar, and [[Samkarsana]] appears as a lion in this [[Vaikuntha Chaturmurti]] statue, showing Vishnu with his three main emanations, the mid-5th century.

In [[Vaishnavism]], Aniruddha is associated with the boar, which is his [[theriomorphic]] aspect, also known as [[Varaha]].&lt;ref&gt;"The glorious Aniruddha should be Varaha who rescued the Earth" in {{cite book |last1=Rangarajan |first1=Haripriya |title=Varāha Images in Madhya Pradesh: An Iconographic Study |date=1997 |publisher=Somaiya Publications |isbn=978-81-7039-214-9 |page=38 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJTpAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Aniruddha (is represented) by his theriomorphic form, the boar" in {{cite book |last1=Srinivasan |first1=Doris |title=Many Heads, Arms, and Eyes: Origin, Meaning, and Form of Multiplicity in Indian Art |date=1997 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-10758-8 |page=254 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZheP9dIX9wC&amp;pg=PA254 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DS39"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Srinivasan |first1=Doris |title=Early Vaiṣṇava Imagery: Caturvyūha and Variant Forms |journal=Archives of Asian Art |date=1979 |volume=32 |pages=39–54 |issn=0066-6637|jstor=20111096 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aniruddha appears as a boar in some of the [[Caturvyūha]] statues, where he is an assistant to [[Vāsudeva]], and in the [[Vaikuntha Chaturmurti]] when his boar's head protrudes from the side of [[Vishnu]]'s head.&lt;ref name="DS39"/&gt;

Aniruddha is also associated with the qualities of ferociousness and sovereignty.&lt;ref name="VIA"&gt;"Gentleness and strength are associated with Vasudeva, "knowledge with Samkarsana, (Narasimha) female power with Pradyumna (Varaha) and ferociousness and sovereignty with Aniruddha (Kapila)." {{cite book |last1=Kamalakar |first1=G. |last2=Veerender |first2=M. |title=Vishnu in Art, Thought &amp; Literature |date=1993 |publisher=Birla Archeological &amp; Cultural Research Institute |page=92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMcYAAAAYAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Pradyumna and Aniruddha died in the intoxicated brawl between the Yadavas, which claimed the life of every Yadava prince, except Vajra, who was the only survivor. [[Arjuna]] moved the survivors to the kingdom of [[Indraprastha]] and crowned Vajra the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Srimad Bhagavatam: Canto 11 - Chapter 30|url=http://bhagavata.org/canto11/chapter30.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Bhagavata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Srimad Bhagavatam: Canto 11 - Chapter 31|url=http://bhagavata.org/canto11/chapter31.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Bhagavata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==
The story of Aniruddha and Usha (as ''Okha'' in Gujarati, also "Ukha" in Assamese) is depicted in the 18th century [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] [[Akhyana]] entitled ''Okhaharan'' by [[Premanand Bhatt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sen|first=Siba Pada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HyhuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=okha+haran+Akhyan+Premanand|title=Sources of the History of India|date=1988|publisher=Institute of Historical Studies|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1901 Telugu language play titled ''[[Usha Parinayam]]'' written by [[Vedam Venkataraya Sastry]] was based on his love story with Usha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Leiter|first=Samuel L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JttNAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Usha+Parinayam+play|title=Encyclopedia of Asian Theatre: A-N|date=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-33530-3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aniruddha, which means "unstoppable," is also another name of Vishnu.

A temple of Dharma stood in the Jaun Bazaar street in Calcutta during the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IWsoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA322&amp;lpg=PA322&amp;dq=%E2%80%98Buddhist+Temple+in+Jaun+Bazar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ff9ex5nQBb&amp;sig=ACfU3U2JWUNsEUhCfGQ9QlWZxD2F2UutZg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwialsLM2NHlAhUKt54KHU16CwMQ6AEwAnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%98Buddhist%20Temple%20in%20Jaun%20Bazar&amp;f=false The Calcutta Review, Volume 106, 1898  p. 322]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Dharmaraj has been linked with many gods such as Sun-god [[Surya]], [[Varuna]], [[Vishnu]], [[Yama]], [[Shiva]] and even with [[Buddhism]]. Fundamentally, it all started with the magical beliefs related to harvesting in the primitive days and thereafter layers of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] Hindu and Buddhist beliefs transformed it in many ways at different places and has now become too complex to trace its roots properly.&lt;ref name=Mitra1&gt;Mitra, Dr. Amalendu, ''Rarher Sanskriti O Dharmaraj'', (in Bengali), first published 1972, 2001 edition, pp. 109–117, Subarnarekha, 73 Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Suniti Kumar Chatterji]] says, "Dharma who is however described as the supreme deity, creator and ordainer of the Universe, superior even to Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva and at times identified with them, and he has nothing of the abstractions of Buddhist Dharma about him." He has further opined that the songs and dances linked with [[Gajan (festival)|Gajan]] of Dharma is clearly non-Aryan in origin. It could be [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] or [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Tibeto-Chinese]].&lt;ref name=Mitra1/&gt;   

[[Sukumar Sen (linguist)|Sukumar Sen]] says that Dharmaraj has come down with the so-called lower category of common people. They formed a majority at one point of time and had no right to [[Brahminical Hinduism|Brahminical]] learning. Brahmins who started migrating to [[Bengal]] in large numbers during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period were mostly not the original inhabitants of Bengal and as such had no links with Dharmaraj. He was not a personal-god but a community-god worshipped by many at a time. He was worshipped by large groups of non-Brahmins.&lt;ref name=Mitra1/&gt; 

It is notable that very important patrons of his worship were Brahmins and that they wrote most of the scriptures dedicated to his worship. These include works ''Dharma Purana'' of Mayura Bhatt,&lt;ref&gt;P. 19 ''The history of medieval Vaishnavism in Orissa'' By Prabhat Mukherjee&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Dharmamangal]]'' of Mayura Bhatta, Manik Ganguly, Ghanarama, Sahadeva Chakravarty,&lt;ref&gt;P. v ''History of Bengali language and literature: A series of lectures delivered as Reader to the Calcutta University'' by Dineshchandra Sen, University of Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt; and Ruparama.&lt;ref&gt;P. 30 ''Vaiṣṇavism in Bengal, 1486-1900'' by Ramakanta Chakravarti&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the Ghanarama festival,&lt;ref&gt;P. 87 ''Spolia zeylanica: Volume 36'' by National Museums of Sri Lanka, Colombo Museum, Colombo, Ceylon&lt;/ref&gt; in which modern-day adherents worship Dharmaraj is named after the Brahmin Ghanarama Chakravarti.

Frank Korom, a Professor of Religion and Anthropology at Boston University, wrote his PhD dissertation on Dharmaraj. He found that Dharmaraj is perceived and worshipped differently from district to district.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Joseph Korom, "``To be happy'': Narrative, ritual play and leisure in an annual Bengali religious festival" (1 January 1992). Dissertations available from ProQuest. Paper AAI9235162. http://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI9235162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahan==
Hindu gods and goddesses have ''[[Vahana|bahans]]'' – an animal on which the deity rides. Horse is the ''bahan'' of Dharmaraj. However, in some cases the elephant is also used as a ''bahan''. In the Rarh region where Dharmaraj is worshipped there is no end to the symbolic use of terracotta and wooden horses. Symbolic sacrifice of horses for fulfilment of wishes is common for many village gods and goddesses, but an assembly of terracotta horses of various shapes and sizes representing sacrifice on wish fulfilment is perhaps peculiar to Dharmaraj. It is a possibility that the horse symboloises links with the Sun-god.&lt;ref&gt;Mitra, Dr. Amalendu, pp. 156-159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gajan==
The festival associated with Dharmaraj is called Dharmer [[Gajan (festival)|gajan]] or Dharma's gajan.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, R. (2008). Rites of Spring. Gājan in Village Bengal. New Delhi: Chronicle Books. Ferrari, F.M. (2010). Guilty Males and Proud Females. Negotiating Genders in a Bengali Festival. Calcutta and London: Seagull.&lt;/ref&gt; Shiva’s gajan and Dharmaraj's gajan are similar. The horse is essential in Dharmaraj's gajan but it is not so in Shiva’s gajan. The sannyasis (hermits) of gajan are called ''bhakta'' of ''bhaktia''.  They observe certain rituals which are similar to those observed on a person’s death. There is certain amount of confusion regarding the interpretation of the rituals as gajan is supposed to celebrate the marriage of Dharmaraj with Mukti.&lt;ref&gt;Mitra, Dr. Amalendu,  pp. 165-169&lt;/ref&gt; The skull dance is part of Gajan. This is believed to be  of non-Aryan origin.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Binoy, ''Paschim Banger Sanskriti'', (in Bengali), part I, 1976 edition, p. 67, Prakash Bhaban&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sharabha''' ({{lang-sa|शरभ}}, {{IAST|Śarabha|Sharav}},Tamil: ஸரபா, {{lang-kn|ಶರಭ}}, Telugu: శరభ) or '''Sarabha''' is a part-lion and part-bird beast in [[Hindu mythology]], who is described eight-legged and more powerful than a lion or an elephant, possessing the ability to clear a valley in one jump. In later literature, Sharabha is described as an eight-legged deer.&lt;ref name="Pattanaik"&gt;{{cite book| last = Pattanaik| first = Devdutt| title = Shiva to Shankara decoding the phallic symbol| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Oka4ekgGDRoC&amp;pg=PA29| year = 2006| publisher = Indus Source| isbn = 978-81-88569-04-5| pages = 123–124| work = Sharabha (Shiva Purana) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw1057-zaryahan.jpg|title=शरभ|work=Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary|page=1057|access-date=18 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226140735/http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=%2Fscans%2FMWScan%2FMWScanjpg%2Fmw1057-zaryahan.jpg|archive-date=2012-02-26|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shaiva]] scriptures narrate that god [[Shiva]] assumed the form of Sharabha to pacify [[Narasimha]] - the fierce man-lion avatar of [[Vishnu]] worshipped by the [[Vaishnava]] sect. This form is popularly known as '''Sharabeshwara''' ("Lord Sharabha") or '''Sharabeshwaramurti'''.&lt;ref name="Waradpande"&gt;{{cite book| last = Waradpande| first = N. R.| title = The mythical Aryans and their invasion| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GR1uAAAAMAAJ| access-date = 2010-01-09| year = 2000| publisher = Books &amp; Books| isbn = 978-81-85016-57-3| pages = 43, 46| work = Sharabha }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vaishnavas refute the portrayal of Narasimha as being destroyed by Shiva-Sharabha and regard Sharabha as a name of Vishnu. The Vimathgira purana, Vathistabhaana purana, Bhalukka purana, and other puranas narrate that Vishnu assumed the form of the ferocious [[Gandabherunda]] bird-animal to combat Sharabha.

==Development and iconography==
In Sanskrit literature, Sharabha is initially described as an aggressive beast that roared and scared other animals in the hills and forest areas. Similies compare warriors to Sharabha. In the Hindu epic [[Mahabharata]], this form of Sharabha was defined as a lion-slaying monster with eight legs, eyes on the top; living in the forest and which ate raw flesh. It is also mentioned as residing on Mount [[Krauncha]] but not as a monster but as an ordinary beast along with lions and tigers on mount [[Gandhamadana]]. The epic also includes Sharabha in the list of edible animals - the ''mrigajatis''- the animal group of antelope, deer, hare, bear, ruru deer, sambar, gayal, boar, and buffalo - which was offered as part of food at dinner to guests. Sharabha appears primarily as the incarnation of the god [[Shiva]], as a name of a monkey-king in the epic [[Ramayana]], also as a proper name of heroes and serpent [[Nāga]]s and one of the names of god [[Vishnu]] as well as [[Buddha]].&lt;ref name="Hopkins"&gt;{{cite book| last = Hopkins| first = E.

However, the features explained are of an eight legged animal of the size of a camel with huge horns and conjectured as a large Himalayan goat.&lt;ref name="Zimmermann"&gt;{{cite book| last = Zimmermann| first = Francis| title = Volume 4 of Indian medical tradition Alternative Medicine Series| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=V1o_PRCLOeMC&amp;pg=PA82| access-date = 2010-01-15| year = 1999| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publishers| isbn = 978-81-208-1618-3| page = 82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shiva's incarnation===
In [[Puranas|Puranic literature]], Sharabha is associated with god [[Shiva]], who incarnates to subdue fierce manifestations of Vishnu. The legend of Sharabha fighting [[Narasimha]] - the man-lion form of Vishnu - brings to fore the overt rivalry between the devotees of Vishnu ([[Vaishnava]] sect) and those of Shiva ([[Shaiva]] sect), which exposes the fierce debate aspect.&lt;ref name=Pattanaik/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blurton"&gt;{{cite book| last = Blurton| first = T.

It also has a long face and nose, nails, eight legs, eight tusks, a cluster of manes, and a long tail. It jumps high repeatedly making a loud cry.&lt;ref name="Roy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shastri"&gt;{{cite book| last = Shastri| first = Biswanarayan| title = Kalika purana| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ivVToiARmkoC&amp;pg=PA25| access-date = 2010-01-15| year = 1994| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ| isbn = 978-81-208-1124-9| pages = 25–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NarasimhaHara.JPG|thumb|Two-headed Sharabha with four legs.]]
The iconography of Sharabeshwaramurti (Shiva as Sharabha) is specifically defined in texts such as ''[[Agama (Hinduism)|Kamikagama]]'' and ''[[Sritattvanidhi]]''. In Kamikagama, Sharabha is described in the form of a bird with golden color, with two uplifted wings, two red eyes, four legs in the form of a lion touching the ground, four legs with claws upwards, and with an animal tail. The top part of the body is shown as human but with the face of a lion with an ornamented crown; side tusks are also depicted giving an overall frightening sight. It also shows the Narasimha beneath Sharabha's legs as a lion-faced human with ''[[Añjali Mudrā|anjali]]'' (hands folded prayer gesture). (See Infobox image)&lt;ref name= "Rao p.172-173"&gt;Rao pp.172–173&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Sritattvanidhi'', the depiction prescribed for Sharabeshwaramurti is of thirty arms; arms on the right are to hold [[Vajra|thunderbolt]], mushti, abhaya, [[chakra]] (discus), sakti, [[danda|staff]], [[ankusha|goad]], sword, [[khatvanga]], [[parashu|axe]], akshamala, a bone, bow, musala, and fire; and the left hands to display noose, varada, [[Gada (mace)|mace]], arrow, flag, and another type of sword, a snake, a lotus flower, [[kapala|skull-cup]], pustaka, plough, and mrudanga with one hand encircling [[Durga]] in a hug. This form is extolled to usher good luck, cure all diseases and destroy all enemies.&lt;ref name="Rao p.173"&gt;Rao p.173&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chola dynasty]] in Tamil Nadu was particularly favourable to the beliefs of Shaiva sect. It is said that the sectarian aspect got highlighted during their reign. This is evident from the four Sharabha images, the earliest at the Vikramsolishwaram temple near Kumbakonam built by [[Vikrama Chola]] (1118–35). The other images are at [[Darasuram]] and [[Kampaheswarar Temple, Thirubuvanam|Kampahareshvarar temple]], [[Thirubuvanam]] built by a Chola ruler, [[Kulottunga Chola III]] where Sharabha's image is housed in a separate shrine.&lt;ref name="Smith "&gt;{{cite book| last = Smith| first = David| title = The Dance of Siva Religion, Art and Poetry in South India Volume 7 of Cambridge Studies in Religious Traditions| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4EvknQEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA191| access-date = 2010-01-15| year = 2003| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-52865-8| page = 193 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sculpture of Sharbeshwaramurti in the Tribhuvanam temple, a Shiva temple in [[Tanjore district]], in [[Tamil Nadu]] is seen with three legs, with body and face of a lion and a tail. It has four human arms, the right upper hand holds axe, noose is held in the lower right hand, the deer in the upper left hand and fire in the lower left hand. Narasimha is shown with eight arms in the [[Airavatesvara Temple]] at Darasuram, a rare image of the Chola period, in black basalt, depicts Shiva as Sharabha. It is deified in an exclusive small shrine, as part man, beast and bird, destroying the man-lion incarnation of Vishnu, Narasimha. This highlights the hostility between the Shaivite and Vaishnavite sects.&lt;ref name="Kamat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamat.com/jyotsna/blog/blog.php?BlogID=1149|title=Gandaberunda- The Two Headed Bird|access-date=2010-01-10|publisher=Kamat Potpourri|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202000034/http://www.kamat.com/jyotsna/blog/blog.php?BlogID=1149|archive-date=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Maharashtra]] the stone cut Sharabha idol is placed on the outer walls of the entrance gate of many historic forts.

In iconographic representations of the myth of Shiva vis-à-vis Vishnu, Sharabha form has been built around Narasimha but substantially embellished with wings to represent [[Kali]] and [[Durga]] to denote the female powers ([[shakti]]s) of Shiva; Sharabha is also shown with a bird head and a serpent in his beak head.&lt;ref name="Kramrisch"&gt;{{cite book| last = Kramrisch| first = Stella| title = The Presence of Siva| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O5BanndcIgUC&amp;pg=PA436| access-date = 2010-01-15| year = 1994| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 978-0-691-01930-7| page = 436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hindu scriptures==

===In the ''Mahabharata''===
The [[Hindu epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'' narrates: a dog, with the help of a [[Rishi]] (sage) assumes various animal forms - starting from a dog to a tiger then to an elephant followed by a lion and a sharabha - terrorized every one in the hermitage of the Rishi. Eventually, Sharabha assumed a further fiercer form. In this fierce form he wanted to devour the Rishi. The Rishi then narrating the process of change in Sharabha's development, as a result of his benevolence, cursed Sharabha to go back to his original form of a dog.&lt;ref name="Ganguli "&gt;{{cite book| last = Ganguli| first = Kisari Mohan| title = The Mahabharata of Krishna-dwaipayana Vyasa, Book-12| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CnQVCgtmW-sC&amp;pg=PA348| access-date = 2010-01-15| year = 2009| publisher = BiblioBazaar, LLC| isbn = 978-0-559-13713-6| pages = 347–348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The epic does not relate Shiva to Sharabha.

===Shaiva views===
[[File:Sarabha Narasinmha Kangra.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sharabha (right) with Narasimha killing [[Hiranyakashipu]] as [[Prahlada]] and his mother look on.]]
The legend of Sharabha as an incarnation of Shiva is narrated in many Hindu scriptures and each presents a different version to suit one's religious beliefs. But one common refrain in all these depictions is that Sharabha is a combination of a huge animal-bird beast with enormous strength manifested with the purpose of pacifying similar ferocious avatar of Vishnu such as [[Narasimha]] (man-lion).

The Narasimha-Sharabha legend is linked to deities assuming mythical animal forms to slay or subdue each other. Vishnu assumed the form of Narasimha to slay [[Hiranyakashipu]], an [[asura]] (demon) king, who was terrorising the universe, and was a devotee of Shiva.&lt;ref name=Pattanaik/&gt;&lt;ref name= Blurton/&gt;

While the canon ending of the tale of Narasimha is that he returned to [[Vaikuntha]] after his fury vanished when he beheld the devotion of [[Prahlada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Swami |first=Bodhasarananda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a4SoCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=narsimha+prahlada&amp;pg=PT62 |title=Stories from the Bhagavatam |date=2016-03-02 |publisher=Advaita Ashrama |isbn=978-81-7505-814-9 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shaivism|Shaivas]] sought to made retroactive changes to assert Shiva's supremacy. The ''[[Shiva Purana]]'' mentions: After slaying Hiranyakashipu, Narasimha's wrath threatened the world. At the behest of the gods, Shiva sent [[Virabhadra]] to tackle Narasimha. When that failed, Shiva manifested as Sharabha.

The Shiva Purana and some puranas mention Sharabha attacking Narasimha and immobilising him. He thus quelled Narasimha's terrifying rage.&lt;ref name="Woodroffe"&gt;{{cite book| last = Woodroffe| first = Sir John| title = Hymns to the Goddess|publisher = Forgotten Books| isbn = 978-1-60620-146-6| page = 151| work = Saharab }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soifer 1991 91–92"&gt;{{cite book| last = Soifer| first = Deborah A.| title = The myths of Narasiṁha and Vāmana two avatars in cosmological perspective| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OoFDK_sDGHwC&amp;pg=PA4| year = 1991| publisher = SUNY Press| isbn = 978-0-7914-0799-8| pages = 90–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also said that Sharabha then decapitated and de-skinned Narasimha so Shiva could wear the hide and lion-head as a garment.&lt;ref name="Pattanaik" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Knipe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakker" /&gt; The ''[[Linga Purana]]'' and the ''[[Sharabha Upanishad]]'' also mention the mutilation and murder of Narasimha. After the mutilation, Vishnu assumed his normal form and retired to his abode, after duly praising Shiva. It was from here on that Shiva came to be known as "Sharabeshamurti" or "Simhagnamurti".&lt;ref name="Rao" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakker" /&gt;

The ''[[Skanda Purana]]'' considers Narasimha as a mere irritation to Hiranyakasipu and not a threat to the world, contrary to what was brought out in the Shiva and Linga Puranas. The perception was that Vishnu may permanently adopt the fierce form of Narasimha, which would be detrimental to his role of doing good deeds. Hence, the purpose of Shiva assuming the form of Sharabha was to ensure that the lion body of Vishnu was discarded and he got united with his original divine form. Narasimha struck Sharabha with his body, it was Vishnu who groaned in pain and not Sharabha who was in an "adamantine body". It was then that Vishnu realised that Sharabha was none other than Shiva and bowed and praised Sharabha. Shiva then blesses Vishnu and gives him a boon to kill [[daityas|demons]].&lt;ref name= Bakker &gt;{{Cite book|author = Phyllis Granoff|editor = Bakker, Hans| title=Origin and growth of the Purāṇic text corpus|pages=116–131|chapter = Saving the Saviour| access-date=2010-01-15| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLN0F7GGecsC&amp;q=sarabha&amp;pg=PA122|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|year=2004|isbn=8120820495}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Purana ends the story with gods fearing that Sharabha may not be able to control his rage and thus urging Shiva to give up his Sharabha form.

In the ''[[Kalika Purana]]'', [[Varaha]] - Vishnu's boar avatar - had amorous dalliance with the [[Prithvi|earth goddess]]. He and his three boar sons then created mayhem in the world, which necessitated Shiva to take the form of Sharabha, to kill the Varaha form. Here, Narasimha appears to aid Varaha. Sharabha kills Narasimha first and then kills Varaha, allowing Vishnu to reabsorb the energies of both his forms.&lt;ref name="Roy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shastri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frederick"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frederick M.

===Vaishnava views===
[[File:Ashtamukha Gandaberunda Narasimha.jpg|thumb|left|Narasimha transformed into Gandabherunda, to combat Sharabha. Ashtamukha Gandabherunda Narasimha slaying Sharabha and Hiranyakashipu, depicted in his lap.]]

Vaishnava followers including [[Dvaita]] scholars, such as [[Vijayendra Tirtha]] (1514–93) refute the portrayal of Narasimha as being destroyed by Sharabha as they consider the Shaivite Puranas as [[tamasic]] - and thus not authoritative. The refutation of the Sharabha legend along with ten other Shaivite legends is discussed in a text by Vijayindra Tirtha called ''Shaivasarvasvakhandanam''.&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;{{cite book| last = Sharma| first = B.

The Vathistabhaana purana, Vimathgira purana, Pradhana purana, Prahladhaswayam Purana, Bhalukka purana and many other puranas narrate that Narasimha took the form of [[Gandabherunda]] (literally "the mighty two-headed"), a more ferocious two-headed bird-animal, who combats and kills Shiva-Sharabha.&lt;ref name="Kamat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/05-09/features1382.htm|title=Nrsimhadev-Ganda Bherunada and Shiva Sarabha |date=23 May 2005|work=The Sampradaya Sun|publisher=HareKrsna.com|access-date=2 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406211613/http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/05-09/features1382.htm|archive-date=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thepatriot.in/2018/11/29/one-bird-two-heads/|title=One bird, two heads|date=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a reference to Sharabha in the ''[[Vishnu sahasranama]]'', the thousand names of Vishnu, and the literal meaning seems to suggest the praise of Sharabha (the lion-killing animal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Swami [[Chinmayananda]]| first = Swami| title = Vishnusahasranama| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=G2EfW1oiVw8C&amp;pg=PA107| publisher = [[Chinmaya Mission]]| isbn = 978-81-7597-245-2| page = 107 }} Stanza 37, line 1: "atulah '''sharabhah''' bheemah samayagno havirharih sarvalakshanalakshanyah lakshmeevaan samitinjayah."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adi Shankaracharya]] refutes the sectarian Sharabha story and refers to this 356th name of Vishnu sahasranama as not mentioning the lion-killing animal at all and instead interprets the name to mean, "As the Lord shines in the body as the indwelling Self, He is called Sharabha, while the body is sara (perishable)."&lt;ref&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami, Sri Vishnu Sahasranama, pg. 91, Chennai: Sri Ramakrishna Math. Sanskrit and English, with an English translation of Sri Sankara Bhagavatpada's commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narasimhan Krishnamachari, a scholar on [[Vishishtadvaita]] philosophy, states that the name "Sharabha" has been interpreted in two ways namely; the first interpretation means "the Destroyer (of those who transgress the bounds of ethics)," as given by the [[Sri Sampradaya|Sri Vaishnavite]] commentator, [[Parasara Bhattar]] and the second interpretation as given by Adi Sankara, among others.&lt;ref name = "Krishnamachari"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahobilavalli.org/vishnu_sahasra_namam_vol2.pdf|title= Vishnusahsranamam, Volume II- Annotated Commentaries by Sri Narasimhan Krishnamachari|publisher=hobilavalli.org|access-date=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former is based on the [[Sanskrit]] verb SR, which means "to injure to destroy".&lt;ref name = "Krishnamachari"/&gt; According to C.

==In Buddhist scriptures==
[[File:Sharabha deer.jpg|thumb|Sharabha is depicted similar to a deer, folio from Jataka tales.]]

In the [[Jataka tales]] of [[the Buddha]]'s previous lives, there is narration related to his birth as [[Bodhisattva]] in a forest as a Sharabha, the eight-legged deer. This story is of one compassion of the deer shown towards the King who wanted to hunt the deer. The King, while trying to hunt the deer, fell into a precipice with his horse. The deer instead of abandoning the king to his fate rescued him. The King was deeply touched by the compassion shown by the deer and thereafter promulgated a decry stating that hunting was an illegal activity in his country.&lt;ref name="Himalaya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.himalayanart.org/image.cfm/50215.html|title= Shakyamuni Buddha - Jataka (previous lives)|access-date=2010-01-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031232948/http://www.himalayanart.org/image.cfm/50215.html|archive-date=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Edward Byles Cowell|author2=Sir Robert Chalmers |author3=William Henry Denham Rouse |author4=Henry Thomas Francis |author5=Robert Alexander Neil | title = The Jātaka or stories of the Buddha's former births| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tyzjqrJ2YnwC&amp;pg=PA166| volume = 4| year = 2000| publisher = Asian Educational Services| isbn = 978-81-206-1469-7| pages = 166–74| chapter = Sarabha-Miga-Jataka| editor = Edward Byles Cowell }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], sharabha is represented as a beast with a goat's head and horns, a lion's mane and horse's body and legs. It symbolizes determination, strength and speed. Sometimes, it is represented additionally with horns of an antelope and claws of an eagle. Sometimes, the goat head is replaced by a lion's, horse's feet by a lion's and horns can be of a ram. A common feature of all representations is the horse's body. It is often depicted as mounts of young [[Deva (Buddhism)|Devas]] or dwarfs in a ''[[Torana]]'' – a six-level archway behind an enlightenment throne of a [[Buddha]] or [[Bodhisattva]]. Together with the devas, they symbolize the perfection of effort (virya).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Robert Beér| title = The encyclopedia of Tibetan symbols and motifs| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XlqeS3WjSWIC&amp;pg=PA90| year = 2004| publisher = Serindia Publications, Inc.| isbn = 978-1-932476-10-1| pages = 80, 90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Robert Beer| title = The handbook of Tibetan Buddhist symbols| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-3804Ud9-4IC&amp;pg=PA259| year = 2003| publisher = Serindia Publications, Inc.| isbn = 978-1-932476-03-3| page = 259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudras''' refer to the forms of the god [[Rudra]], whose traditions have since been associated with [[Shiva]]. They make up eleven of the [[thirty-three gods]] in the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] pantheon.&lt;ref name = "hopkins"&gt;Hopkins pp. 172-3&lt;/ref&gt; They are at times identified with the storm deities referred to as [[Maruts]], while at other times considered distinct from them.&lt;ref name = "alain"/&gt;

While the ''[[Vamana Purana]]'' describes Rudras as the sons of Kashyapa and Aditi, Maruts are described distinct from the Rudras as the 49 sons of [[Diti]], sister of Aditi, and the attendants of Indra, rather than Rudra.&lt;ref&gt;Mani pp. 489-90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and names==
The ''[[Ramayana]]'' tells they are eleven of the 33 children of the sage [[Kashyapa]] and his wife [[Aditi]], along with the 12 [[Adityas]], 8 [[Vasus]] and 2 Ashvins, constituting the  [[Thirty-three gods]].&lt;ref name = "Mani"&gt;Mani pp. 654–5&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Vamana Purana]]'' describes the Rudras as the sons of Kashyapa and Aditi.&lt;ref name = "alain"/&gt; The ''[[Matsya Purana]]'' notes that [[Surabhi]] – the mother of all cows and the "cow of plenty" – was the consort of Brahma and their union produced the eleven Rudras. Here they are named&lt;ref name = "Matsya"&gt;{{cite book|last=A Taluqdar of Oudh|title=The Matsya Puranam|series=The Sacred books of the Hindus|volume=2|year=2008|publisher=Cosmo Publications for Genesis Publishing Pvt Ltd.|isbn=978-81-307-0533-0|pages=74–5, 137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Harivamsa]]'', an appendix of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', makes Kashyapa and Surabhi – here, portrayed as his wife – the parents of the Rudras.&lt;ref name = "alain"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance in the Mahabharata, it is [[Dharma]] (possibly identified with [[Yama]]) who is the father of the Rudras and the Maruts.&lt;ref name = "hopkins"/&gt;

[[File:Bangalore Shiva.jpg|thumb|Rudra, identified with the Puranic Shiva (pictured) is associated with the Rudras.]]

The ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' narrates that Rudra – here identified as [[Shiva]] . The furious Rudra was in [[Ardhanari]] form, half his body was male and other half female. He divided himself into two: the male and female. The male form then split itself into eleven, forming the eleven Rudras. Some of them were white and gentle; while others were dark and fierce. They are called:

#[[Manyu (deity)|Manyu]]
#Manu 
#Mahmasa 
#Mahan 
#[[Shiva|Siva]] 
#Rtudhvaja 
#Ugraretas
#[[Bhava]] 
#[[Kama]]
#[[Vamadeva]]
#Dhrtavrata

From the woman were born the eleven Rudranis who became wives of the Rudras. They are:
 
#Dhi 
#Vrtti 
#Usana 
#Urna 
#Niyuta 
#Sarpis 
#Ila 
#[[Ambika (goddess)|Ambika]] 
#Iravatl 
#Svadha
#Diksa

Brahma allotted to the Rudras the eleven positions of the heart and the five [[sensory organs]], the five organs of action and the mind.&lt;ref name = "Mani"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "alain"/&gt; Other Puranas call them Aja, [[Ekapada]] (Ekapat), Ahirbudhnya, Tvasta, Rudra, Hara, Sambhu, Tryambaka, Aparajita, Isana and Tribhuvana.&lt;ref name = "Mani"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "alain"/&gt;

In one instance in the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the Rudras are eleven in number and are named:

#Mrgavadha 
#Sarpa 
#[[Nirṛti (god)|Nirriti]] 
#Ajaikapad 
#[[Ahi (Hinduism)|Ahi]] 
#Budhnya 
#Pinakin 
#Dahana 
#[[Ishvara]] 
#[[Kapali (Rudras)|Kapali]] 
#[[Shiva|Sthanu]] 
#[[Bhaga]]

While Kapalin is described the foremost of Rudras here,&lt;ref name = "hopkins"/&gt; in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] it is Sankara who is considered the greatest of the Rudras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radhakrishan|first=S.|author-link=Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|title=The Bhagavadgita|year=1977|publisher=Blackie &amp; Son (India) Ltd.|page=263|chapter=Verse 10.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Kapalin and Sankara are epithets of Shiva.&lt;ref name = "hopkins"/&gt; In another instance, they are described as sons of [[Tvastr]] and named:&lt;ref name = "hopkins"/&gt;

#Vishvarupa

#Ahi Budhnya 
#Virupaksa 
#Raivata 
#[[Shiva|Hara]] 
#Bahurupa 
#Tryambaka 
#Savitra 
#Jayanta
#Pinakin

While usually the Rudras are described to eleven, in one instance in the ''Mahabharata''; they are said to be eleven thousand and surrounding Shiva, which is another name for Rudra. &lt;ref name = "hopkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "alain"/&gt; The eleven groups of hundred are named:&lt;ref name = "hopkins"/&gt;

The [http://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/3/12 Bhagavata Purana Canto 3 Chapter 3] mentions that Rudra is born from the anger of Lord Brahma. The names are mentioned in [http://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/3/12/12 Canto 3 Chapter 3 and Verse 12] as follows:
# Manyu
# Manu
# Mahinasa
# Mahān
# Śiva
# Ṛtadhvaja
# Ugraretā
# Bhava
# Kāla
# Vāmadeva
# Dhṛtavrata
In [http://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/6/6 Bhagavata Purana Canto 6 Chapter 6] the eleven Rudras are said to be the children of Sarūpā and Bhūta. Sarūpā was a daughter of Daksa. The names of the eleven Rudras given in [http://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/6/6/17-18 Canto 6 Chapter 6 Verse 17-18] are:
# Raivata
# Aja
# Bhava
# Bhīma
# Vāma
# Ugra
# Vṛṣākapi
# Ajaikapāt
# Ahirbradhna
# Bahurūpa
# Mahān
The ''[[Matsya Purana]]'' mentions the ferocious eleven Rudras – named:

#[[Kapali (Rudras)|Kapali]] 
#Pingala 
#Bhima 
#Virupaksa 
#Vilohita 
#Ajapada
#Ahirabradhya 
#Shasta 
#Shambhu 
#Chanda 
#Bhava

Aiding God [[Vishnu]] in his fight against the demons. They wear lion-skins, matted-hair and serpents around their necks. They have yellow throats, hold tridents and skulls and have the crescent moon on their foreheads. Together headed by Kapali, they slay the elephant demon [[Mythological anecdotes of Ganesha#Shiva and Gajasura|Gajasura]].&lt;ref name = "Matsya"/&gt;

==Associations==
In [[Vedic scriptures]], Rudras are described as loyal companions of Rudra, who later was identified with [[Shiva]]. They are considered as divine aids , messengers and forms of Rudra. They are fearful in nature. The ''[[Satapatha Brahmana]]'' mentions that Rudra is the prince, while Rudras are his subjects. They are considered as attendants of Shiva in later mythology.&lt;ref name = "alain"/&gt;

The [[Rig Veda]] and the Krishna [[Yajur Veda]]&lt;ref name = "Keith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keith|first=Arthur Berriedale |title=Krishna (Black) Yajur Veda|date=10 April 2012 |publisher=Zhingoora Books|isbn=978-1-4751-7361-1|page=670}}&lt;/ref&gt; makes the Rudras the gods of the middle world, situated between earth and heaven i.e. the atmosphere. As wind-gods, the Rudras represent the life-breath.&lt;ref name = "alain"/&gt; In the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'', the eleven Rudras are represented by ten [[Prana|vital energies]] (''rudra-prana'') in the body and the eleventh one being the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]] (the soul).&lt;ref name = "alain"&gt;{{cite book|last=Daniélou|first=Alain|title=The myths and gods of India|year=1991|publisher=Inner Traditions International|isbn=0-89281-354-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mythsgodsofindia00dani/page/102 102–4, 341, 371]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mythsgodsofindia00dani/page/102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rudras are said to preside over the second stage of creation and the intermediary stage of life. They govern the second ritual of sacrifice, the mid-day offering and the second stage of life – from the 24th to the 68 year of life. The ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' prescribes that the Rudras be propitiated in case of sickness in this period and further says that they on departing the body become the cause of tears, the meaning of the name Rudra being the "ones who make cry".&lt;ref name = "alain"/&gt; The [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] explicitly states the fact that since the Rudras leaving the body – causing death – makes people cry, they are Rudras.&lt;ref name = "alain"/&gt;

The ''Mahabharata'' describes the Rudras as companions of [[Indra]], servants of Shiva and his son [[Murugan|Skanda]] and companions of Yama, who is surrounded by them. They have immense power, wear golden necklaces and are "like lighting-illuminated clouds".&lt;ref name = "hopkins"/&gt; The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' prescribes the worship of the Rudras to gain virile power.&lt;ref name = "alain"/&gt;

===Association with Maruts===
[[File:Musée Guimet 897 04.jpg|thumb|Maruts]]
Rudras are at times identified with the [[Maruts]] – sons of Rudra in the Vedas; while at other times, considered distinct from them.&lt;ref name = "alain"/&gt;

Some scholars believe that Rudras and Maruts could be distinct groups, Rudras being the true followers of Rudra and daivic (Godly) in nature. But poets of the ''Rigveda'' declared the Maruts to take the position of the Rudras in order to give status to the Vedic god Rudra. Later in post-Vedic literature like the epics and Puranas, Maruts were associated with [[Indra]], while Rudras gained their former status as followers of Rudra, who had evolved into Shiva.&lt;ref name = "encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Nagendra Singh|title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism|volume=31–45|year=2000|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. LTD|isbn=81-7488-168-9|chapter=The Historical Background of the Maruts|pages= 1067–72, 1090}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars disregard this theory and consider that originally Rudras and Maruts were identical.&lt;ref name = "encyclopaedia"/&gt; A theory suggests that slowly in the Vedas two classes of Maruts came into existence: the friendly and beneficent, and the roaring and turbulent; the latter grew into the distinct group of deities called the Rudras, who were associated only with the wild Rudra.&lt;ref name = "encyclopaedia"/&gt;

In the ''Marut Suktas'' (RV 1, 2, 5, 8) and ''Indra-Suktas'' (RV 1, 3, 8, 10) of the ''Rigveda'' (RV), the epithet "Rudras" – originating from the verb root ''rud'' or ''ru'' and meaning howlers, roarers or shouters – is used numerous times for the Maruts – identifying them with the Rudras even when associated with Indra, rather than Rudra. There are some hymns in the ''Rigveda'' (RV 2, 7, 8, 10) that explicitly distinguish between the Maruts and the Rudras.&lt;ref name = "encyclopaedia"/&gt;

While the ''[[Vamana Purana]]'' describes Rudras as the sons of Kashyapa and Aditi, Maruts are described distinct from the Rudras as 49 sons of [[Diti]], sister of Aditi and attendants of Indra.&lt;ref&gt;Mani pp. 489–90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ashwatthama==

[[Ashwatthama]], the son of [[Drona]], is the avatar of one of the eleven Rudras, along with being one of the eight [[Chiranjivi]] (the immortals). [[Drona]] performed many years of severe penances to please Lord Shiva in order to obtain a son who possessed the same valiance as the latter. Ashwatthama, the powerful son of [[Drona]], though known as the part incarnate of Rudra, was really born of the four parts of Yama (death), Rudra (destruction), Kama (love) and Krodha (anger). Just before [[Mahabharata]] war, [[Bhishma]] himself declared that it would be virtually impossible for anyone to kill or defeat Ashwatthama in battle as he was the part incarnate of Rudra. [[Bhishma]] stated that when Ashwatthama becomes angry, it would become impossible to fight him as he would become "a second [[Shiva]]". The dishonoured death of [[Drona]] left Aswathama infuriated, and this event led directly to the annihilation of most of the [[Pandava]] lineage by the hands of Ashwatthama himself.&lt;ref&gt;J.L Shastri.

The deity is pictured on Indus Valley tablets as an elongated anthropomorphic figure with three protuberances in the head. This deity is suggested to be associated with the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] god [[Murugan]]. Since the material is scarse and the [[Indus script]] is hard to interpret, the suggestions as yet are rather tentative, "bold guesses".&lt;ref&gt;[http://murugan.org/research/salomon.htm “Deciphering the Indus Script” (book reviews)], ''Richard Salomon'', Vol. 116, The Journal of the American Oriental Society, 10-21-1996, pp. 745(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nalakuvara''', also known as '''Nalakubara''' ({{Lang-sa|नलकूबर|translit=Nalakūbara}}), appears in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] mythology as the brother of Manigriva (also known as [[Manibhadra]]), the son of the [[yaksha]] king [[Kubera]] (also known as [[Vaiśravaṇa|Vaishravana]]), and husband of [[Rambha (apsara)|Rambha]] and Ratnamala. Nalakuvara often appears as a sexual [[trickster]] figure in Hindu and Buddhist literature.

==Names==
Various [[Sanskrit]] and [[Prakrit]] texts offer the name "Nalakuvara", "Nalakūvala", "Mayuraja", "Narakuvera", and "Naṭakuvera" to describe the son of Kubera. The god also appears in Chinese texts as "Nazha", and later "[[Nezha]]", a shortened transliteration of the word "Nalakuvara".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shahar|first=Meir|title=India in the Chinese Imagination|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-4560-8|pages=27|editor=John Kieschnick and Meir Shahar|chapter=Indian Mythology and the Chinese Imagination: Nezha, Nalakubara, and Krshna |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend ==

=== Hinduism ===

==== Ramayana ====
In the [[Rāmāyaṇa|Ramayana]], Nalakuvara's, first wife, [[Rambha (apsara)|Rambha]], was sexually assaulted by his uncle, [[Rāvaṇa|Ravaṇa]]. In the Valmiki Ramayana, Nalakuvara curses Ravana that he would never be able to approach another youthful woman unless she shares her love; if, carried away by lust, he does violence to any woman who does not love him, his head would split into seven pieces.’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-ramayana-of-valmiki/d/doc424792.html|title= Ramayana of Valmiki, Book 7: Uttara kanda: Chapter 26|publisher= Wisdom Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; This curse protected the chastity of [[Sītā|Sita]], the wife of [[Rāma|Rama]], after she was kidnapped by Ravana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blush.me/unwind/rambha-apsara-raped-ravana|title=Blush.me}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Puranic Encyclopedia: a comprehensive dictionary with special reference to the epic and Puranic literature, Vettam Mani, Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, 1975, p. [https://archive.org/stream/puranicencyclopa00maniuoft#page/519/mode/2up 519].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bhagavata Purana ====
[[File:Unknown Indian - Untitled (Story of Krishna) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Krishna frees the brothers from the curse.]]
In the [[Bhagavata Purana]], Nalakuvara, and his brother [[Manibhadra|Manigriva]], are cursed by the sage [[Narada]] into becoming trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parmeshwaranand|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Puranas, Volume 1|year=2001|isbn=9788176252263|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QxPCBCk3wVIC&amp;q=nalakubara&amp;pg=PA902|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are later liberated by the child-god [[Bala Krishna|Krishna]].

Nalakuvera and Manigriva were playing, in the nude, in the [[Ganges]], with [[Apsara|apsaras]], when Narada walked by after a visit with Vishnu. Upon seeing Narada, the maidens covered themselves, while Nalakuvara and Manigriva were too intoxicated to notice Narada, and remained unclothed. According to some accounts, Narada pitied the brothers for wasting away their lives through their excessive indulgence in women and wine. In order to help the brothers realise their mistake, Narada cursed them into two Marutu trees. Narada wished for the brothers to meet Krishna after many years, who would be able to liberate them from the curse. In other accounts, it is said that Narada is so offended by the brothers’ lack of dignity and respect, that he cursed them into trees. After the two brothers pleaded with Narada, he consented that they could be liberated if Krishna touched them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Prabhupada|first1=His Divine Grace A. C.

Many years later, when Krishna was in his infancy, his foster-mother [[Yashoda]] had tied him to a mortar in order to prevent him from eating dirt. Krishna dragged the mortar along the ground until it became wedged between two trees. These trees happened to be Nalakuvara and Manigriva, and upon contact, they returned to their original forms. The brothers then paid homage to Krishna, apologised for their previous mistakes, and departed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shahar|first=Meir|title=India in the Chinese Imagination|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-4560-8|pages=35|editor=John Kieschnick and Meir Shahar|chapter=Indian Mythology and the Chinese Imagination: Nezha, Nalakubara, and Krshna|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
In the [[Kākāti Jātaka]] story, Nalakuvara (here Naṭakuvera), appears as the court musician of the king of [[Benares]]. After the King's wife, Queen Kākātī, is kidnapped by the [[Garuḍa]] King, the King of Benares sends Naṭakuvera to look for her. Naṭakuvera hides within the plumage of the Garuḍa King, who carries Naṭakuvera to his nest. Once he has arrived, Naṭakuvera has sex with Queen Kākātī. Afterwards Naṭakuvera returned to Benares in the Garuḍa's wing, and composed a song telling of his experiences with Kākātī. When the Garuḍa hears the song, he realises that he has been tricked, he brings Kākātī back home to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malalasekera|first=G.P.|title=Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, Vol. 1|date=September 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LEn9i9pnRHEC&amp;q=kakati+jataka&amp;pg=PA559|accessdate=9 May 2014|page=559|isbn=9788120618237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tantric masters invoked Nalakuvara as the commander of Kubera's army of yakṣas. He appears in the tantric text "Great Peacock-Queen Spell," which portrays him as a heroic yakṣa general and invokes Nalakūvara's name as a way to cure snakebites. Some versions of the "Great Peacock-Queen Spell" (Mahāmāyūrīvidyārājñī and the "Amogha-pāśa" give Nalakuvara the title "Great Yakṣa General."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shahar|first=Meir|title=India in the Chinese Imagination|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-4560-8|pages=27–29|editor=John Kieschnick and Meir Shahar|chapter=Indian Mythology and the Chinese Imagination: Nezha, Nalakubara, and Krshna|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nalakuvara appears in two other tantric texts: "The Yakṣa Nartakapara’s Tantra," and "The Great Yakṣa General Natakapara’s Tantric Rituals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shahar|first=Meir|title=India in the Chinese Imagination|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-4560-8|pages=27|editor=John Kieschnick and Meir Shahar|chapter=Indian Mythology and the Chinese Imagination: Nezha, Nalakubara, and Krshna|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship in East Asia==
[[File:Ping Sien Si - 008 Nezha (deity) (15513109434).jpg|thumb|right|Nezha (on the left) in Fengshen Yanyi]]
Nalakuvara was transmitted through Buddhist texts into China, where he became known as [[Nezha]] (known earlier as Nazha). In Chinese mythology, Nezha is the third son of the Tower King, so many people also called Nezha as the third prince. Nezha is also called "Marshal of the Central Altar".

According to [[Meir Shahar]], the etymology of the word “Nezha” showed that the name is a shortened (and slightly corrupted) transcription of the Sanskrit name "Nalakūbara."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shahar|first=Meir|title=India in the Chinese Imagination|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-4560-8|pages=27|editor=John Kieschnick and Meir Shahar|chapter=Indian Mythology and the Chinese Imagination: Nezha, Nalakubara, and Krshna|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested by Shahar that the legends surrounding Nezha are a combination of the mythology of Nalakuvara and the child-god Krishna (Bala Krishna).

Nezha is a well-known Doaoist deity in Japan. The Japanese refer to Nezha as Nataku or Nata, which came from the readings of ''[[Journey to the West]]''.

'''Jagannath''' ({{lang-or|ଜଗନ୍ନାଥ|lit=Lord of the Universe|Jagannātha}}; formerly {{lang-en|Juggernaut}}) is a deity worshipped in regional [[Hinduism|Hindu traditions]] in [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] as part of a triad along with his brother [[Balarama|Balabhadra]], and sister, [[Subhadra]]. Jagannath, within [[Odisha|Odia]] Hinduism, is the supreme god, ''[[Purushottama]]'',{{sfn|Eschmann|Kulke|Tripathi|1978|pp=31–98}}{{sfn|Rajaguru|1992}}{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=72–77|loc=Cult Purusottama at Puri}} and the ''[[Para Brahman]]''.{{sfn|Miśra|2005|p=99|loc=chapter 9, Jagannāthism}}{{sfn|Ray|2007|p=151}} To most [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] Hindus, particularly the [[Krishnaism|Krishnaites]], Jagannath is an abstract representation of [[Krishna]], or [[Vishnu]],{{sfn|Mukherjee|1981|p=67}}{{sfn|Hardy|1987|pp=387–392}} sometimes as the [[avatar]] of Krishna or Vishnu.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1981|pp=155–156}}{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=73, 76}} To some [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] and [[Shakta]] Hindus, he is a symmetry-filled [[Tantra|tantric]] form of [[Bhairava]], a fierce manifestation of [[Shiva]] associated with annihilation.&lt;ref name="Mohanty2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Das 2010 89" /&gt;

The Jagannathism ({{a.k.a.}} Odia Vaishnavism) — the particular sector of Jagannath as a major deity — emerged in the [[Early Middle Ages]]{{sfn|Mukherjee|1981}}{{sfn|Eschmann|Kulke|Tripathi|1978}} and later became an independent state regional temple-centered tradition of [[Krishnaism]]/Vaishnavism.{{sfnm|1a1=Mukherjee|1y=1981|1p= |2a1=Eschmann|2a2=Kulke|2a3=Tripathi|2y=1978|2p=|3a1=Hardy|3y=1987|3pp=387–392|4a1=Rajaguru|4y=1992|4p=|5a1=Guy|5y=1992|5pp=213–230|6a1=Starza|6y=1993|6p=|7a1=Ray|7y=1993|7p=|8a1=Patnaik|8y=1994|8p=|9a1=Kulke|9a2=Schnepel|9y=2001|9p=|10a1=Miśra|10y=2005|10loc=chapter 9, Jagannāthism}}

The idol of Jagannath is a carved and decorated wooden stump with large round eyes and a symmetric face, and the idol has a conspicuous absence of hands or legs. The worship procedures, sacraments and rituals associated with Jagannath are syncretic and include rites that are uncommon in Hinduism.{{sfn|Patnaik|1994|loc=chapter 6. Sanatana Dharma: The Great Synthesis}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jagannath.nic.in/pdf/SYNTHETIC%20CHARACTER%20OF%20JAGANNATHA%20CULTURE.pdf "Synthetic Character of Jagannath Culture", Pp.&amp;nbsp;1–4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708233822/http://jagannath.nic.in/pdf/SYNTHETIC%20CHARACTER%20OF%20JAGANNATHA%20CULTURE.pdf |date=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually, the icon is made of wood and replaced with a new one at regular intervals.

The origin and evolution of Jagannath worship is unclear.{{sfn|Patra|2011|pp=5–16}} Some scholars interpret hymn 10.155.3 of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' as a possible origin, but others disagree and state that it is a syncretic/synthetic deity with tribal roots.{{sfn|Starza|1993|p=72}}{{sfn|Patnaik|1994|loc=chapter 6. Sanatana Dharma: The Great Synthesis}}{{sfn|Patra|2011|pp=5–16}} The English word ''[[juggernaut]]'' comes from the negative image of the deity presented by [[Christian mission|Christian missionaries]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Jagannath is considered a non-sectarian deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pradhan|first=Atul Chandra|title=Evolution of Jagannath Cult|journal=Orissa Review|date=June 2004|pages=74–77|url=http://www.orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/jun2004/englishpdf/evolution2.pdf|access-date=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Miśra|2005|p=97|loc=chapter 9, Jagannāthism}}&lt;ref name="Patnaik"&gt;{{cite news|last=Patnaik|first=Bibhuti|title=My friend, philosopher and guide|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110703/jsp/orissa/story_14191152.jsp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715032448/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110703/jsp/orissa/story_14191152.jsp|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 July 2013|access-date=1 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is significant regionally in the Indian states of [[Odisha]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[West Bengal]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Bihar]], [[Gujarat]], [[Assam]], [[Manipur]] and [[Tripura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tripathy|first=B|author2=Singh P.K.|title=Jagannath Cult in North-east India|journal=Orissa Review|date=June 2012|pages=24–27|url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2012/June/engpdf/27-30.pdf|access-date=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also significant to the Hindus of Bangladesh. The [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath temple]] in Puri, Odisha is particularly significant in Vaishnavism, and is regarded as one of the [[Char Dham]] pilgrimage sites in India.&lt;ref&gt;See: Chakravarti 1994, p 140&lt;/ref&gt; The Jagannath temple is massive, over {{convert|200|ft|order=flip}} high in the ''Nagara'' Hindu temple style, and one of the best surviving specimens of [[Kalinga architecture]], namely Odisha art and architecture.&lt;ref name=misra139/&gt; It has been one of the major pilgrimage destinations for Hindus since about 800 CE.&lt;ref name=misra139&gt;{{cite book|author=Bijoy M Misra|editor=Edwin Francis Bryant|title=Krishna: A Sourcebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0z02cZe8PU8C |year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803400-1|pages=139–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual festival called the [[Ratha yatra]] celebrated in June or July every year in eastern states of India is dedicated to Jagannath. His image, along with the other two associated deities, is ceremoniously brought out of the sacrosanctum ([[Garbhagriha]]) of his chief temple in [[Jagannath Puri|Puri]] ({{lang|or|ଶ୍ରୀ ମନ୍ଦିର}}, {{transl|or|Śrī Mandir}}). They are placed in a chariot which is then pulled by numerous volunteers to the [[Gundicha Temple]], (located at a distance of nearly {{cvt|3|km|disp=or}}). They stay there for a few days, after which they are returned to the main temple. Coinciding with the Ratha Yatra festival at Puri, similar processions are organized at Jagannath temples throughout the world. During the festive public procession of Jagannath in Puri lakhs of devotees visit Puri to see Lord Jagganath in chariot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduikm: N-Z|url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000loch|url-access=registration|year= 2002|publisher= Rosen Publishing|isbn=978-0-8239-3180-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000loch/page/n123 567]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Jagannath'' is a [[Sanskrit]] word, compounded of ''jagat'' meaning "universe" and ''nātha'' meaning "Master" or "Lord". Thus, ''Jagannath'' means "lord of the universe".{{sfn|Eschmann|Kulke|Tripathi|1978|p=537}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2009/July/engpdf/july-09-1.pdf#page=13|title=Lord Jagannath Symbol of National Integration|first= Basanta Kumar |last=Das |work=Orissa Review |year=2009 |quote=The term Jagannath etymologically means the Lord of the Universe |access-date=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=20em|align=right|Jagannatha, according to them is a generic term, not unique, as much as Lokanatha or Avalokiteswara. ln fact, the name Jagannatha could be applied to any Deity which is considered supreme.|— [[Surendra Mohanty]]|Lord Jagannatha: the microcosm of Indian spiritual culture&lt;ref&gt;[[Surendra Mohanty|Mohanty, Surendra]].

In the [[Odia language]], ''Jagannath'' is linked to other names, such as ''Jagā'' (ଜଗା) or ''Jagabandhu'' (ଜଗବନ୍ଧୁ) ("Friend of the Universe"). Both names derive from ''Jagannath''. Further, on the basis of the physical appearance of the deity, names like ''Kalia'' (କାଳିଆ) ("The Black-coloured Lord", but which can also mean "the Timely One"), ''Darubrahman'' (ଦାରୁବ୍ରହ୍ମ) ("The Sacred Wood-Riddle"), ''Dāruēdebatā'' ({{lang|or|ଦାରୁ ଦେବତା}} "The wooden god"), Chakā ākhi ({{lang|or|ଚକା ଆଖି}}) or ''Chakānayan'' ({{lang|or|ଚକା ନୟନ}} "With round eyes"), ''Cakāḍōḷā'' ({{lang|or|ଚକା ଡୋଳା}} "with round pupils") are also in vogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lordjagannath.co.in/j_names.htm |title=::: LordJagannath.Co.in ::: Lord Jagannath (Names) |work=lordjagannath.co.in |year=2010|quote=Different names of Shree Jagannath|access-date=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/03-08/features970.htm | title=The Sampradaya Sun - Independent Vaisnava News - Feature Stories - March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://puriwaves.nirmalya.in/feature-article/64-names-of-lord-jagannath-around-odisha |title=64 Names of Lord Jagannath Around Odisha &amp;#124; PURIWAVES |work=puriwaves.nirmalya.in |quote=Sri Jagannath is being worshipped throughout Orissa over thirty districts in 64 names. |access-date=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dina Krishna Joshi, the word may have origins in the tribal word ''Kittung'' of the [[Sora people]] (Savaras). This hypothesis states that the Vedic people as they settled into tribal regions adopted the tribal words and called the deity Jagannath.&lt;ref name="Joshi 2007 80–84"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joshi|first=Dina Krishna|title=Lord Jagannath: the tribal deity|journal=Orissa Review|date=June–July 2007|pages=80–84|url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/june_july-2007/engpdf/Pages80-84.pdf|access-date=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to O.M. Starza, this is unlikely because ''Kittung'' is phonetically unrelated, and the ''Kittung'' tribal deity is produced from burnt wood and looks very different from Jagannath.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=65–67 with footnotes}}

The icon of Jagannath in his temples is a brightly painted, rough-hewn log of ''neem'' wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wendy Doniger|author2=Merriam-Webster, In|title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780877790440 |url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=978-0-87779-044-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780877790440/page/547 547]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image consists of a square flat head, a pillar that represents his face merging with the chest. The icon lacks a neck, ears, and limbs, is identified by a large circular face symbolizing someone who is ''anadi'' (without beginning) and ''ananta'' (without end).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Santilata Dei|title=Vaiṣṇavism in Orissa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q0kdAAAAMAAJ|year=1988|publisher=Punthi |isbn=978-81-85094-14-4|pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this face are two big symmetric circular eyes with no eyelids, one eye symbolizing the sun and the other the moon, features traceable in 17th-century paintings. He is shown with an ''[[Urdhva Pundra]]'', the Vaishnava U-shaped mark on his forehead. His dark color and other facial features are an abstraction of the cosmic form of the Hindu god Krishna, states Starza.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=48–52}} In some contemporary Jagannath temples, two stumps pointing forward in hug-giving position represent his hands. In some exceptional medieval and modern era paintings in museums outside India, such as in Berlin states Starza, Jagannath is shown "fully anthropomorphised" but with the traditional abstract mask face.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=48–52}}

The typical icon of Jagannath is unlike other deities found in Hinduism who are predominantly anthropomorphic. However, aniconic forms of Hindu deities are not uncommon. For example, Shiva is often represented in the form of a Shiva [[linga]]. In most Jagannath temples in the eastern states of India, and all his major temples such as the Puri, Odisha, Jagannath is included with his brother Balabhadra and sister Subhadra. Apart from the principal companion deities, Jagannath icon shows a [[Sudarshana Chakra]] and sometimes under the umbrella cover of multiheaded Sesha Naga, both linking him to [[Vishnu]]. He was one of the introduction to Hinduism to early European explorers and merchants who sailed into Calcutta and ports of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The Italian [[Odoric of Pordenone]] who was a Franciscan friar, visited his temple and procession in 1321 CE, and described him in the language of the Church. William Burton, visited his temple at Puri in 1633, spelled him as ''Jagarnat'' and described him to be "in a shape like a serpent, with seven hoods".&lt;ref name=Sricon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chowdhury|first=Janmejay|title=Iconography of Jagannath|journal=Srimandir|pages=21–23|url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Srimandir/srimandirenglish/Epdf/Ech6.pdf|access-date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When shown with Balabhadra and Subhadra, he is identifiable from his circular eyes compared to the oval or almond shape of the other two abstract icons.

===Attributes===
In the Jagannath tradition (Odia Vaishnavism), Lord Jagannath is most frequently identified with an abstract form of [[Krishna]] as the supreme deity.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1981|p=67}}{{sfn|Hardy|1987|pp=387–392}}&lt;ref name="Srinivasan2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Srinivasa. |title=Hinduism For Dummies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=br61gYKt5Q0C&amp;pg=PA96 |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-118-11077-5 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagannath is considered as equivalent to the Hindu metaphysical concepts of [[Brahman]]/[[Para Brahman]] and [[Purushottama]]/Shunya Purusha, wherein he then is the Avatarī, i.e., the cause and equivalence of all avatars and the infinite existence in space and time.{{sfn|Eschmann|Kulke|Tripathi|1978|pp=31–98}}{{sfn|Rajaguru|1992}}{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=72–77|loc=Cult Purusottama at Puri}}{{sfn|Patnaik|2005|pp=111–119}}{{sfn|Miśra|2005|p=99|loc=chapter 9, Jagannāthism}}&lt;ref name="Mishra"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mishra|first=Kabi|title=He is the infinite Brahman|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110703/jsp/orissa/story_14191119.jsp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528135924/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110703/jsp/orissa/story_14191119.jsp|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 May 2015|access-date=1 December 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph, Kolkata|date=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author Dipti Ray in ''Prataparudra Deva'', the Suryavamsi King of Odisha:

{{Blockquote|In Prataparudradeva's time Odia poets accepted [[Sarala Dasa]]'s idea and expressed in their literary works as all the [[Avatar]]as of [[Vishnu]] (Jagannath) manifest from him and after their cosmic play dissolute (bilaya) in him (Jagannath). According to them Jagannath is Sunnya Purusa, Nirakar and Niranjan who is ever present in Nilachala to do cosmic play&amp;nbsp;... The five [[Vaishnavite]] Sakhas ["Comrades"] of [[Odisha|Orissa]] during Prataparudradeva's time expounded in their works the idea that Jagannath ([[Purushottama]]) is Purna Brahman from whom other Avataras like [[Rama]], Krishna, etc., took their birth for lilas in this universe and at the end would merge in the self of Purna Brahman.|Dipti Ray{{sfn|Ray|2007|p=151}}}}

In the Jagannath tradition, he has the attributes of all the avatars of Krishna/Vishnu. This belief is celebrated by dressing him and worshipping him as different avatars on special occasions.&lt;ref name="Bengal1825"&gt;{{cite book|author=Asiatic Society of Bengal|title=Asiatic researches or transactions of the Society instituted in Bengal, for inquiring into the history and antiquities, the arts, sciences, and literature, of Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nyZFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA319|year=1825|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Puranas relate that the [[Narasimha]] Avatar of Vishnu appeared from a wooden pillar.

===Tantric deity===
Outside of Vaishnava tradition, Jagannath is considered the epitome of [[Tantra|Tantric]] worship.&lt;ref name="Siṃhadeba2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jitāmitra Prasāda Siṃhadeba|title=Tāntric Art of Orissa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k2jr3_rSEysC&amp;pg=PA146|year=2001|publisher=Gyan Books|isbn=978-81-7835-041-7|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symmetry in iconography, the use of mandalas and geometric patterns in its rites support the tantric connection proposal.{{sfn|Patra|2011|pp=8–10, 17–18}}

Jagannath is venerated as [[Bhairava]] or Lord [[Shiva]], the consort of Goddess Vimala, by [[Shaivites]] and [[Shakta]] sects.&lt;ref name="Mohanty2009"/&gt; The priests of Jagannath Temple at Puri belong to the Shakta sect, although the Vaishnava sect's influence predominates.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=64}} As part of the triad, [[Balabhadra]] is also considered to be Shiva and [[Subhadra]], a manifestation of [[Durga]].&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

==Origins==

===Vedic origin of Jagannath===
In hymn 10.155 of the ''[[Rig veda|Rigveda]]'', there is mention of a Daru (wooden log) floating in the ocean as ''apurusham''.{{sfn|Patra|2011|pp=5–16}}&lt;ref name="Rig Veda"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig Veda|publisher=Wikisource |location=verse 10.155.3|url= https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rig_Veda/Mandala_10/Hymn_155 |author=Ralph TH Griffith }}; [https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.१५५ Quote]: अदो '''यद्दारु''' प्लवते सिन्धोः पारे '''अपूरुषम्''' । तदा रभस्व दुर्हणो तेन गच्छ परस्तरम् ॥३॥&lt;/ref&gt; Acharya [[Sayana]] interpreted the term ''apurusham'' as same as ''Purushottama'' and this ''Dara'' wood log being an inspiration for Jagannath, thus placing the origin of Jagannath in 2nd millennium BCE. Other scholars refute this interpretation stating that the correct context of the hymn is "Alaxmi Stava" of Arayi.{{sfn|Patra|2011|pp=5–16}}

According to Bijoy Misra, Puri natives do call Jagannatha as Purushottama, consider driftwood a savior symbol, and later Hindu texts of the region describe the Supreme Being as ever present in everything, pervasive in all animate and inanimate things. Therefore, while the Vedic connection is subject to interpretation, the overlap in the ideas exist.&lt;ref name=misra139/&gt;

===Buddhist origins===
[[File:Rath Yatra Puri 2007 11047.jpg|thumb|The Jagannath festivities in Puri attract crowds with no class or caste barriers. Some 19th-century writers saw this as one evidence for Buddhist origins,{{sfn|Patra|2011|pp=8–10, 17–18}} now a discredited theory.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=59–60 with footnotes}}]]
The [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] origins of Jagannatha stems from the reliquary worship associated with Jagannatha, a concept integral to Buddhism but alien to Hinduism. For example, there exists an unexamined relic in the Jagannath shrine in Puri,{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=58–59 with footnotes}} and the local legends state that the shrine relic contains a tooth of the [[Gautama Buddha]] – a feature common to many cherished Theravada Buddhist shrines in and outside of India.&lt;ref name=misra139/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ananda Abeysekara|title=Colors of the Robe: Religion, Identity, and Difference |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2BXV9zQwAwC&amp;pg=PA148 |year=2002|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-57003-467-1|pages=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other legends state that the shrine also contains bones of the human incarnation of the Hindu god Krishna, after he was accidentally killed by a deer hunter. However, in the Hindu tradition, a dead body is cremated, ashes returned to nature, and the mortal remains or bones are not preserved or adored.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=54–56 with footnotes}} In Buddhism, preserving skeletal parts such as "Buddha's tooth" or relics of dead saints is a thriving tradition. The existence of these legends, state some scholars such as Stevenson, suggests that Jagannath may have a Buddhist origin.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=58–59 with footnotes}} However, this is a weak justification because some other traditions such as those in Jainism and tribal folk religions too have had instances of preserving and venerating relics of the dead.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=54–56 with footnotes}}

Another evidence that links Jagannath deity to Buddhism is the ''[[Ratha-Yatra]]'' festival for Jagannath, the stupa-like shape of the temple and a [[dharmachakra]]-like discus (''chakra'') at the top of the spire. The major annual procession festival has many features found in the [[Mahayana Buddhism]] traditions.&lt;ref name=misra139/&gt; [[Faxian]] (c. 400 CE&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Faxian Faxian: Chinese Buddhist Monk], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;), the ancient Chinese pilgrim and visitor to India wrote about a Buddhist procession in his memoir, and this has very close resemblances with the Jagannath festivities. Further the season in which the ''Ratha-Yatra'' festival is observed is about the same time when the historic public processions welcomed Buddhist monks for their temporary, annual monsoon-season retirement.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=54–56 with footnotes}}{{refn|group=note|The same ancient monastic practice of 3-4 months temporary retirement of all monks and nuns, to take shelter at one place during the heavy rainfalls of monsoons, is found in the Hindu and Jain monastic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gwynne|title=World Religions in Practice: A Comparative Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdsRKc_knZoC&amp;pg=RA5-PT216|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-6005-9|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Carrithers|author2=Caroline Humphrey|title=The Assembly of Listeners: Jains in Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LW8czr_HzzwC |year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-36505-5|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another basis for this theory has been the observed mixing of people of Jagannath Hindu tradition contrary to the caste segregation theories popular with colonial era missionaries and Indologists. Since caste barriers never existed among devotees in Jagannath's temple, and Buddhism was believed to have been a religion that rejected caste system, colonial era Indologists and Christian missionaries such as Verrier Elwin suggested that Jagannath must have been a Buddhist deity and the devotees were a caste-rejecting Buddhist community.{{sfn|Patra|2011|pp=8–10, 17–18}}&lt;ref name="Olsen2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brad Olsen|title=Sacred Places Around the World: 108 Destinations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FS40w2nrqQC&amp;pg=PA91|year=2004|publisher=CCC Publishing|isbn=978-1-888729-10-8|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Starza, this theory is refuted by the fact that other Indic traditions did not support caste distinctions, such as the Hindu [[Smartism|Smarta]] tradition founded by [[Adi Shankara]], and the traditional feeding of the Hindus together in the region regardless of class, caste or economic condition in the memory of Codaganga.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=59–60 with footnotes}} This reconciliation is also weak because Jagannath is venerated by all Hindu sects,&lt;ref name="Bengal1825"/&gt; not just [[Vaishnavas]] or a regional group of Hindus, and Jagannath has a pan-Indian influence.&lt;ref name="Mohanty2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jagannath Mohanty|title=Encyclopaedia of Education, Culture and Children's Literature: v. 3.

Yet another evidence is that Jagannath is sometimes identified with or substituted for [[Shakyamuni Buddha]], as the ninth avatar of Vishnu by Hindus, when it could have been substituted for any other avatar.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=54–56 with footnotes}} Jagannath was worshipped in Puri by the Odias as a form of Shakyamuni Buddha from a long time. [[Jayadeva]], in [[Gita Govinda]] also has described [[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|Buddha]] as one among the [[Dasavatara]]. Indrabhuti, the ancient Buddhist king, describes Jagannath as a Buddhist deity in ''Jnanasidhi''.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=54–56 with footnotes}} Further, as a Buddhist king, Indrabhuti worshipped Jagannath.{{sfn|Patra|2011|pp=6–7}} This is not unique to the coastal state of Odisha, but possibly also influenced Buddhism in [[Nepal]] and [[Tibet]]. Shakyamuni Buddha is also worshipped as Jagannath in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;Kar. Dr. Karunakar. Ascharja Charjachaya. Orissa Sahitya Akademy (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; This circumstantial evidence has been questioned because the reverent mention of Jagannath in the Indrabhuti text may merely be a coincidental homonym, may indeed refer to Shakyamuni Buddha, because the same name may refer to two different persons or things.{{sfn|Patra|2011|pp=6–7}}

Some scholars argue that evidences of Jagannatha's Buddhist nature are found from Medieval Odia Literature. Many medieval Odia poets conceptualized Jagannatha as Shunya Brahman, which is similar to the great void found in Mahayana Buddhist philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Mansinha Mayadhar. "History of Oriya Literature." Sahitya Akademi, 1960. 70-72.&lt;/ref&gt; Odia poet Sarala Dasa of 15th century in his Mahabharata describes Jagannatha as Buddha.

&lt;!-- I changed this line Odia poet Sarala Dasa of 15th century in his Mahabharata describes Buddha as one of the ten incarnations of Vishnu to this line: Odia poet Sarala Dasa of 15th century in his Mahabharata describes Jagannatha as Buddha. The corresponding note which has the line from the Odia poetry which says the exact same thing was not reflected in the main body previously. The poetry identifies Jagannatha with Buddha and NOT Buddha as one of the ten avataras of Vishnu which the previous main body of the text claimed. I have also block quoted the lines from the reference in the main body so as to eliminate confusion for the readers... --&gt;
Later poets such as Darika Dasa and Magunia Dasa mentioned Buddha as an incarnation of Jagannatha instead of Vishnu.{{refn|group=note|"In Magunia Dasa's "Darubramha" Canto 5 Sloka 31-32, Dasa writes, "Saw on top of the throne, In the form of Buddha, Existed Darubramha Jagannatha, without his hand or feet."}}&lt;ref&gt;Mitra Nagendranath. "Puritirtha". Gurudas Chattopadhyay. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some these references Buddha is mentioned as incarnation of Vishnu or Jagannath, not vice versa,{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=73, 128}}{{sfn|Holt|2008|p=18–21}}{{sfn|Coulter|2013|p=109}}{{sfn|Srinivasan|2011|p=182}}{{sfn|Holt|Kinnard|Walters|2012|p=4, 95, 111}}{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=96}} therefore Jagannath is considered as the source of all incarnations. Furthermore, the mention of Buddha as part of [[Dashavatara|ten avatara]] was prevalent across many [[Hindu]] sects other than Jagannath cult and was a broader movement in [[Vaishnavism]] to incorporate Buddha as one of the ten main avatara of Vishnu between fifth and the sixth century,{{sfn|Doniger O'Flaherty|1988|p=188}}{{sfn|Holt|2004|p=12, 15}} who was in turn linked with Jagannath as a source of all avataras starting from [[Jayadeva]] of 12th century.{{sfn|Leyden|1982|p=22}} So, the mention of Buddha as Jagannath does not proof the Buddhist origin of Jagannath, rather assimilation of Buddha in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Abhimanyu Dash "Lord Buddha in the Cult of Lord Jagannath" Magazine of Govt. of Odisha. Jun 2014. 85-89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jain origins===
Pandit Nilakantha Das suggested that Jagannath was a deity of [[Jain]] origin because of the appending of ''Nath'' to many Jain [[Tirthankar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mohanty|first=Jagannath|title=Indian Culture and Education|year=2009|publisher=Deep&amp; Deep|isbn=978-81-8450-150-6|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3T2Ph_SmjtoC&amp;q=nilakantha+das+jagannath&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt Jagannath meant the 'World personified' in the Jain context and was derived from ''Jinanath''. Evidence of the Jain terminology such as of [[Kaivalya]], which means [[moksha]] or salvation, is found in the Jagannath tradition.&lt;ref name="Barik 2005 36"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barik|first=P M|title=Jainism and Buddhism in Jagannath culture|journal=Orissa Review|date=July 2005|pages=36|url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/jul2005/engpdf/jainism_budhism_in_joga-culture.pdf|access-date=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the twenty two steps leading to the temple, called the ''Baisi Pahacha'', have been proposed as symbolic reverence for the first 22 of the 24 Tirthankaras of Jainism.{{sfn|Patra|2011|pp=8–10, 17–18}}

According to Annirudh Das, the original Jagannath deity was influenced by Jainism and is none other than the ''Jina'' of Kalinga taken to [[Magadha]] by [[Mahapadma Nanda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Das|first=Aniruddha|title=Jagannath and Nepal|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of Jain origins is supported by the Jain [[Hathigumpha inscription]]. It mentions the worship of a relic memorial in Khandagiri-Udayagiri, on the Kumara hill. This location is stated to be same as the Jagannath temple site. However, states Starza, a Jain text mentions the Jagannath shrine was restored by Jains, but the authenticity and date of this text is unclear.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=62–63 with footnotes}}

Another circumstantial evidence supporting the Jain origins proposal is the discovery of Jaina images inside as well as near the massive Puri temple complex, including those carved into the walls. However, this could also be a later addition, or suggestive of tolerance, mutual support or close relationship between the Jains and the Hindus.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=62–63 with footnotes}} According to Starza, the Jain influence on the Jagannath tradition is difficult to assess given the sketchy uncertain evidence, but nothing establishes that the Jagannath tradition has a Jain origin.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=62–63 with footnotes}}

=== Vaishnava origins ===
[[File:Dadhivaman deity.png|thumb|An old Dadhivaman deity in [[Kendrapara]], [[Odisha]]. [[Bhaktivinoda Thakur|Shrila Bhakti Vinod Thakur]]'s great forefather [[Krishnananda Dutta Chaudhury|Krishnanada]] started worshipping this deity in mid-14th century AD. ]]
The Vaishnava origin theories rely on the iconographic details and the typical presence of the triad of deities, something that Buddhist, Jaina and tribal origins theories have difficulty in coherently explaining. The colors, state the scholars of the Vaishnava origin theory, link to black-colored Krishna and white-colored Balarama. They add that the goddess originally was Ekanamsa (Durga of Shaiva-Shakti tradition, sister of Krishna through his foster family). She was later renamed to Shubhadra (Lakshmi) per Vaishnava terminology for the divine feminine.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=63–64 with footnotes}}

The weakness of the Vaishnava origins theory is that it conflates two systems. While it is true that the Vaishnava Hindus in the eastern region of India worshipped the triad of Balarama, Ekanamsa and Krishna, it does not automatically prove that the Jagannath triad originated from the same. Some medieval texts, for example, present the Jagannath triad as Brahma (Subhadra), Shiva (Balarama) and Vishnu. The historic evidence and current practices suggest that the Jagannath tradition has a strong dedication to the [[Harihara]] (fusion Shiva-Vishnu) idea as well as tantric Shri Vidya practices, neither of which reconcile with the Vaishnava origins proposal.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=63–64 with footnotes}} Further, in many Jagannath temples of central and eastern regions of India, the Shiva icons such as the [[Lingam|Linga-yoni]] are reverentially incorporated, a fact that is difficult to explain given the assumed competition between the Shaivism and Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=63–64 with footnotes}}

===Tribal origins===
[[File:Nrusimha Besha.JPG|thumb|Jagannath in the [[Narasimha]] or Nrusingha Besha in [[Jagannath Temple, Koraput|Koraput]] ]]
The tribal origin theories rely on circumstantial evidence and inferences such as the Jagannath icon is non-anthropomorphic and non-zoomorphic.&lt;ref name="Joshi 2007 80–84"/&gt; The hereditary priests in the Jagannath tradition of Hinduism include non-Brahmin servitors, called ''Daitas'', which may be an adopted grandfathered practice with tribal roots. The use of wood as a construction material for the Jagannath icons may also be a tribal practice that continued when Hindus adopted prior practices and merged them with their Vedic abstractions.&lt;ref name="Sricon"/&gt; The practice of using wood for making ''[[murti]]'' is unusual, as Hindu texts on the design and construction of images recommend stone or metal.&lt;ref name=misra139/&gt; The ''Daitas'' are Hindu, but believed to have been the ancient tribe of ''Sabaras'' (also spelled ''Soras''). They continue to have special privileges such as being the first to view the new replacement images of Jagannath carved from wood approximately every 12 years. Further, this group is traditionally accepted to have the exclusive privilege of serving the principal meals and offerings to Jagannath and his associate deities.&lt;ref name=misra139/&gt;{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=65–67 with footnotes}}

According to [[Verrier Elwin]], a convert to Hinduism, Jagannatha in a local legend was a tribal deity who was coopted by a Brahmin priest.&lt;ref name=elwin597&gt;{{cite book|last=Elwin|first=Verrier|title=The Religion of an Indian Tribe|year=1955|publisher=Oxford University Press (Reprint)|page=597}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original tribal deity, states Elwin, was ''Kittung'' which too is made from wood. According to the Polish Indologist Olgierd M. Starza, this is an interesting parallel but a flawed one because the ''Kittung'' deity is produced by burning a piece of wood and too different in its specifics to be the origin of Jagannath.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=65–67 with footnotes}} According to another proposal by [[Stella Kramrisch]], log as a symbol of ''Anga pen'' deity is found in central Indian tribes and they have used it to represent features of the Hindu goddess [[Kali]] with it. However, states Starza, this theory is weak because the ''Anga pen'' features a bird or snake like attached head along with other details that make the tribal deity unlike the Jagannath.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=65–67 with footnotes}}

}}
Some scholars such as Kulke and Tripathi have proposed tribal deities such as Stambhesveri or Kambhesvari to be a possible contributor to the Jagannath triad.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=67–70 with footnotes}} However, according to Starza, these are not really tribal deities, but Shaiva deities adopted by tribes in eastern states of India. Yet another proposal for tribal origins is through the medieval era cult of Lakshmi-[[Narasimha]].{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=67–70 with footnotes}} This hypothesis relies on the unusual flat head, curved mouth and large eyes of Jagannath, which may be an attempt to abstract an image of a lion's head ready to attack. While the tribal Narasimha theory is attractive states Starza, a weakness of this proposal is that the abstract Narasimha representation in the form does not appear similar to the images of Narasimha in nearby [[Konark]] and [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] temple artworks.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=67–70 with footnotes}}

In contemporary Odisha, there are many Dadhivaman temples with a wooden pillar god, and this may be same as Jagannath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohanty|first=P.C.|title=Jagannath temples of Ganjam|journal=Odisha Review|date=June 2012|pages=113–118|url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2012/June/engpdf/116-121.pdf|access-date=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syncretic origins===
According to H.S. Patnaik and others, Jagannath is a syncretic/synthetic deity that combined aspects of major faiths like [[Shaivism]], [[Shaktism]], [[Vaishnavism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="Patnaik"/&gt;{{sfn|Patnaik|1994|loc=chapter 6. Sanatana Dharma: The Great Synthesis}}{{sfn|Mukherjee|1981|pp=1–2}}{{sfn|Miśra|2005|p=97|loc=chapter 9, Jagannāthism}} Jagannath is worshipped as Purushottama form of Vishnu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History od deities|url=http://jagannath.nic.in/histdaities.asp|publisher=Jagannath temple, Puri administration|access-date=2 December 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402173714/http://jagannath.nic.in/histdaities.asp|archive-date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krishnaism|Krishnaite]] sampradayas, as example, Gaudiya Vaishnavs, have identified him strongly with Krishna.{{sfn|Hardy|1987|pp=387–392}}&lt;ref name="Bryant 2007 142"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Edwin F|title=Krishna: A Sourcebook|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195148916|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Gaudiya Vaishnav tradition, Balabhadra is the elder brother [[Balaram]], Jagannath is the younger brother [[Krishna]], and Subhadra is the youngest sister.&lt;ref name="Das 2010 89"/&gt;

Balabhadra considered the elder brother of Jagannath is sometimes identified with and worshipped as [[Shiva]].&lt;ref name="Bryant 2007 142"/&gt; Subhadra now considered Jagannath's sister has also been considered as a deity who used to be [[Brahma]].&lt;ref name="Bryant 2007 142"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History of deities"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of deities|url=http://jagannath.nic.in/histdaities.asp|publisher=Jagannath temple, Puri administration|access-date=2 December 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402173714/http://jagannath.nic.in/histdaities.asp|archive-date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the fourth deity, Sudarsana [[Chakra]] symbolizes the wheel of Sun's Chariot, a syncretic absorption of the [[Saura (Hinduism)|Saura]] (Sun god) tradition of Hinduism. The conglomerate of Jagannath, Balabhadra, Subhadra and Sudarshan Chakra worshipped together on a common platform are called the Chaturdha Murty or the "Four-fold Form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Behera|first=Prajna Paramita|title=The Pillars of Homage to Lord Jagannatha|journal=Orissa Review|date=June 2004|pages =65|url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/jun2004/englishpdf/pillar.pdf |access-date=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O.M. Starza states that the Jagannath Ratha Yatra may have evolved from the syncretism of procession rituals for Siva lingas, Vaishnava pillars, and tribal folk festivities.{{Sfn|Starza|1993|pp=70, 97, 105}} The [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] element in the tradition of Jagannath overlap with the rites and doctrines of [[Tantrism]] and [[Shaktism]]. According to the Shaivas, Jagannath is Bhairava.&lt;ref name="OR-CultOfJ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2012/June/engpdf/44-47.pdf |title=The Cult of Jagannath |first=Rabindra Kumar |last=Behuria |publisher=Orissa Review |pages=42–43 |date=June 2012 | access-date=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shiva Purana]] mentions Jagannatha as one of the 108 names of Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Shiva Purana |title=Shiva Shahasranama |url=http://www.harekrsna.de/1000Shiva.htm |website=harekrsna.de |access-date=27 March 2019 |ref=(Book IV), Chapter 35, 1-133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tantric literary texts identify Jagannath with Mahabhairav.&lt;ref name="Das 2010 89"&gt;{{cite book|last=Das|first=Suryanarayan|title=Lord Jagannath|year=2010|publisher=Sanbun|isbn=978-93-80213-22-4|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFn8wSDfSxEC&amp;q=jagannath+as++jain&amp;pg=PA82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another evidence that supports syncretism thesis is the fact that Jagannath sits on the abstract tantric symbols of [[Shri Yantra]]. Further, his Shri Chakra ("holy wheel") is worshipped in the Vijamantra 'Klim', which is also the Vijamantra of Kali or Shakti. The representation of Balaram as Sesanaga or Sankarsana bears testimony to the influence of Shaivism on the cult of Jagannath. The third deity, Devi Subhadra, who represents the Sakti element is still worshipped with the Bhuvaneshwari Mantra.&lt;ref name="OR-CultOfJ"/&gt;

The Tantric texts claim Jagannath to their own, to be Bhairava, and his companion to be same as [[Vimala Temple|Goddess Vimala]] is the Shakti. The offerings of Jagannath becomes ''Mahaprasad'' only after it is re-offered to Goddess Vimala. Similarly, different tantric features of Yantras have been engraved on the Ratna vedi, where Jagannath, Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra are set up. The [[Kalika Purana]] depicts Jagannath as a Tantric deity.&lt;ref name="OR-CultOfJ"/&gt; According to Avinash Patra, the rituals and special place accepted for non-Brahmin ''Daitas'' priests in Jagannath tradition, who co-exist and work together with Brahmin priests suggests that there was a synthesis of Tribal and Brahmanical traditions.{{sfn|Patra|2011|pp=17–18}}

According to the Jain version, the image of Jagannath (Black colour) represents sunya, Subhadra symbolizes the creative energy and Balabhadra (White colour) represents the phenomenal universe. All these images have evolved from the Nila Madhava, the ancient Kalinga Jina. "Sudarshana Chakra" is contended to be the Hindu name of the [[Dharma Chakra]] of Jaina symbol. {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In the words of the historian [[Jadunath Sarkar]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Siṃhadeba|first=Jitāmitra Prasāda|title=Tāntric Art of Orissa|year=2001|publisher=Kalpaz Publications|location=Evolution of tantra in Orissa|isbn=978-81-7835-041-7|page=145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k2jr3_rSEysC&amp;q=jagannath&amp;pg=PA146}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|The diverse religions of [[Odisha|Orissa]] in all ages have tended to gravitate towards and finally merged into the Jagannath worship, at least in theory.}}

===Transformation from unitary icon to triad===
[[File:Shri Jagannatha.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Shri Jagannath with Shri Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra]]
The [[Madala Panji]] observes that Neela Madhav transformed into Jagannath and was worshipped alone as a unitary figure, not as the part of a triad. It is significant to note that the early epigraphic and literary sources refer only to a unitary deity [[Purushottama]] Jagannath.&lt;ref name="Tripathy 2012 30"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tripathy|first=Manorama|title=A Reassessment of the origin of the Jagannath cult of Puri|journal=Orissa Review|date=June 2012|pages=30|url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2012/June/engpdf/31-39.pdf|access-date=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanskrit play "Anargharaghava" composed by Murari mentioned only Purushottama Jagannath and his consort Lakshmi with no references to Blabhadra and Subhadra.&lt;ref name="Tripathy 2012 30"/&gt; The Dasgoba copper plated inscription dating to 1198 also mentions only Purushottama Jagannath in the context that the Puri temple had been originally built by Ganga king Anantavarman Chodaganga (1078–1147) for Vishnu and [[Lakshmi]].&lt;ref name="Tripathy 2012 30"/&gt; These sources are silent on the existence of Balabhadra and Subhadra. Such state of affairs has led to arguments that Purushottama was the original deity and Balabhadra and Subhadra were subsequently drawn in as additions to a unitary figure and formed a triad.

During the rule of Anangabhima III [1211–1239], Balabhadra and Subhadra find the earliest known mention in the Pataleshwara inscription of 1237 CE.&lt;ref name="Tripathy 2012 30"/&gt; According to the German Indologist Kulke, Anangibhima III was the originator of the triad of Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra suggesting that Balabhadra was added after [[Laksmi]]'s transformation into Subhadra.

==Theology==
The [[theology]] and rituals associated with the Jagannatha tradition combine Vedic, Puranic and tantric themes. He is the Vedic-Puranic [[Purushottama]] (lit.: the Upper Person),{{sfn|Rajaguru|1992}}{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=72–77|loc=Cult Purusottama at Puri}} as well as the Puranic [[Narayana]] and the tantric [[Bhairava]].&lt;ref name=misra139/&gt; According to the ''Vishnudharma Purana'' (ca. 4th century), Krishna is woshipped in the form of Purushottama in Odra (Odisha).{{sfn|Starza|1993|p=76}} He is same as the metaphysical [[Para Brahman]], the form of Krishna that prevades as abstract ''kāla'' (time) in Vaishnava thought. He is abstraction which can be inferred and felt but not seen, just like time. Jagannath is ''chaitanya'' (consciousness), and his companion Subhadra represent [[Shakti]] (energy) while Balabhadra represents [[Jnana]] (knowledge).&lt;ref name=misra139/&gt; According to Salabega, the Jagannath tradition assimilates the theologies found in Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, Buddhism, Yoga and Tantra traditions.{{sfn|Sālabega|1998|pp=13–14}}

The Jagannath theology overlaps with those of Krishna. For example, the 17th-century Odia classic ''Rasa kallola'' by Dina Krushna opens with a praise to Jagannath, then recites the story of Krishna with an embedded theology urging the pursuit of knowledge, love and devotion to realize the divine in everything.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=341}} The 13th-century ''Jagannatha vijaya'' in Kannada language by Rudrabhatta is a mixed prose and poetry style text which is predominantly about Krishna. It includes a canto that explains that "Hari (Vishnu), Hara (Shiva) and Brahma" are aspects of the same supreme soul. Its theology, like the Odia text, centers around supreme light being same as "love in the heart".{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=347}} The 15th-century Bhakti scholar [[Shankaradeva]] of [[Assam]] became a devotee of Jagannatha in 1481, and wrote love and compassion inspired plays about Jagannatha-Krishna that influenced the region and remain popular in Assam and Manipur.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|pp=373–374}}

The medieval era Odia scholars such as Ananta, Achyutananda and Chaitanya described the theology of Jagannath as the "personification of the Shunya, or the void", but not entirely in the form of Shunyata of Buddhism. They state Jagannath as "Shunya Brahma", or alternatively as "Nirguna Purusha" (or "abstract personified cosmos"). Vishnu avatars are descend from this Shunya Brahma into human form to keep dharma.{{sfn|Patnaik|2005|pp=111–119}}{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=388}}

==In Hindu texts and traditions==
Although Jagannath has been identified with other traditions in the past, He is now identified more with Vaishnav tradition. 
===Vaishnavite version===
The Skanda Purana and [[Brahma Purana]] have attributed the creation of the Jagannathpuri during the reign of [[Indradyumna]], a pious king and an ascetic who ruled from [[Ujjain]]. According to the second legend, associated with the [[Vaishnava]]s, when Lord Krishna ended the purpose of his Avatar with the illusionary death by Jara and his "mortal" remains were left to decay, some pious people saw the body, collected the bones and preserved them in a box. They remained in the box till it was brought to the attention of Indrdyumna by Lord Vishnu himself who directed him to create the image or a murti of Jagannath from a log and consecrate the bones of Krishna in its belly. Then King Indradyumna, appointed [[Vishwakarma]], the architect of gods, a divine carpenter to carve the murti of the deity from a log which would eventually wash up on the shore at Puri. Indradyumna commissioned Vishwakarma (also said to be the divine god himself in disguise) who accepted the commission on the condition that he could complete the work undisturbed and in private.&lt;ref name="Deshpande2005"&gt;{{cite book | last = Deshpande| first = Aruna | title = India: A Divine Destination| publisher = Crest Publishing House | year = 2005 &lt;!-- | location = Delhi --&gt; | isbn = 978-81-242-0556-3 |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everyone was anxious about the divine work, including the King Indradyumna. After a fortnight of waiting, the King who was anxious to see the deity, could not control his eagerness, and he visited the site where Vishwakarma was working. Soon enough Vishwakarma was very upset and he left the carving of the idol unfinished; the images were without hands and feet. The king was very perturbed by this development and appealed to Brahma to help him. Brahma promised the King that the images which were carved would be deified as carved and would become famous. Following this promise, Indradyumna organized a function to formally deify the images, and invited all gods to be present for the occasion. Brahma presided over the religions function as the chief priest and brought life (soul) to the image and fixed (opened) its eyes. This resulted in the images becoming famous and worshipped at Jagannath Puri in the well known Jagannath Temple as a Kshetra (pilgrimage centre). It is, however, believed that the original images are in a pond near the temple.&lt;ref name="Deshpande2005"/&gt;

===Stories from the Ramayana and Mahabharata===
According to Prabhat Nanda, the [[Valmiki]] ''[[Ramayana]]'' mentions Jagannath.&lt;ref name="Nanda 2007 110–111"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nanda|first=Prabhat Kumar|title=Shree Jagannath and Shree Ram|journal=Orissa Review|date=June–July 2007|pages=110–111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFn8wSDfSxEC&amp;pg=PA26 |access-date=28 November 2012|isbn=9789380213224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that the mythical place where King [[Janak]] performed a [[yajna]] and tilled land to obtain [[Sita]] is the same as the area in which the Gundicha temple is situated in Puri, according to Suryanarayan Das.&lt;ref name="Das 2010 13"&gt;{{cite book|last=Das|first= Suryanarayan|title= Lord Jagannath|year= 2010|publisher= Sanbun|isbn=978-93-80213-22-4|page =13|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gFn8wSDfSxEC&amp;pg=PA26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mahabharata]], states Das, describes King [[Indradyumna]]'s Ashvamedh Yajna and the advent of the four deities of the Jagannath cult.&lt;ref name="Das 2010 13"/&gt;

===Sarala Dasa Mahabharata version===
Sarala Dasa, the great Odia poet of the 15th century while praising Jagannath as the saviour of mankind considered him both as a form of Buddha as well as a manifestation of Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Das|first=Suryanarayan|title=Lord Jagannath|year=2010|publisher=Sanbun|isbn=978-93-80213-22-4|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFn8wSDfSxEC&amp;q=jagannath+sarala+das&amp;pg=PA26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kanchi conquest===
One of the most popular legends associated with Jagannath is that of ''Kanchi Avijana'' (or "Conquest of [[Kanchipuram|Kanchi]]"), also termed as "Kanchi-Kaveri". According to the legends,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Das|first=Suryanarayan|title=Lord Jagannath|year=2010|publisher=Sanbun|isbn=978-93-80213-22-4|pages=163–165|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFn8wSDfSxEC&amp;q=jagannath+sarala+das&amp;pg=PA26}}&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of the King of Kanchi was betrothed to the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati]] of Puri. When the Kanchi King witnessed the Gajapati King sweeping the area in front of where the chariots of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were kept during Ratha yatra, he was aghast. Considering the act of sweeping unworthy of a King, the King of Kanchi declined the marriage proposal, refusing to marry his daughter to a 'Sweeper'. Gajapati Purushottam Deva, felt deeply insulted at this and attacked the Kingdom of Kanchin to avenge his honour. His attack was unsuccessful and his army defeated by the Kanchi Army.

Upon defeat, the Gajapati King Purushottam Deva returned and prayed to Jagannath, the God of land of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] before planning a second campaign to Kanchi. Moved by his prayers, Jagannath and Balabhadra, left their temple in Puri and started an expedition to Kanchi on horseback. It is said that Jagannath rode on a white horse and Balabhadra on a black horse. The legend has such a powerful impact on the [[Oriya culture]] that the simple mention of white horse-black horse evokes the imagery of Kanchi conquest of the God in devotees minds.

[[File:Ashwadwara (Horse Gate) of Jagannath temple, Puri.JPG|thumb|The Ashwadwara at [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Puri]] with the statue of Jagannath on a white horse and Balabhadra on a black horse]]
On the road, Jagannath and Balabhadra grew thirsty and chanced upon a milkmaid Manika, who gave them butter-milk/yogurt to quench their thirst. Instead of paying her dues, Balabhadra gave her a ring telling her to claim her dues from King Purushottam. Later, Purushottam Deva himself passed by with his army. At Adipur near [[Chilika]] lake, the milkmaid Manika halted the King pleading for the unpaid cost of yogurt consumed by His army's two leading soldiers riding on black and white horses. She produced the gold ring as evidence. King Purusottam Deva identified the ring as that of Jagannath. Considering this a sign of divine support for his campaign, the king enthusiastically led the expedition.

In the war between the army of Kalinga inspired by the Divine support of Jagannath and of the army of Kanchi, Purushottam Deva led his army to victory. King Purusottam brought back the Princess Padmavati of Kanchi to Puri. To avenge his humiliation, he ordered his minister to get the princess married to a sweeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Purushottam Dev and Padmavati|publisher=Amar Chitra Katha|url=http://www.amarchitrakatha.com/epics-and-mythology/purushottam-dev-and-padmavati-768|access-date=17 February 2022|archive-date=4 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504164303/http://www.amarchitrakatha.com/epics-and-mythology/purushottam-dev-and-padmavati-768|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minister waited for the annual Ratha Yatra when the King ceremonially sweeps Jagannath's chariot. He offered the princess in marriage to King Purusottam, calling the King a Royal sweeper of God. The King then married the Princess. The Gajapati King also brought back images of [[Uchchhishta_Ganapati|Uchchhishta Ganesh]] (Bhanda Ganesh or Kamada Ganesh) and enshrined them in the Kanchi Ganesh shrine at the Jagannath Temple in Puri.

This myth has been recounted by Mohanty.{{Sfn|Mohanty|1980|p=7}} J.P. Das {{Sfn|Das|1982|p=120}} notes that this story is mentioned in a Madala panji chronicle of the Jagannath Temple of Puri, in relation to Gajapati Purushottama. At any rate, the story was popular soon after Purushottama's reign, as a text of the first half of the 16th century mentions a Kanchi Avijana scene in the Jagannath temple. There is currently a prominent relief in the ''[[jaga mohan]]'' (prayer hall) of the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath temple]] of Puri that depicts this scene.

In modern culture, Kanchi Vijaya is a major motif in [[Odissi dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guruji's Compositions:Dance and Drama|url=http://www.srjan.com/dancedrama.aspx|work=of Kelucharan Mohapatra|publisher=Srjan|access-date=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029132340/http://www.srjan.com/dancedrama.aspx|archive-date=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Odia literature]], the Kanchi conquest (Kanchi Kaveri) has significant bearing, in medieval literature romanticized as the epic '''Kanchi Kaveri''' by [[Purushottama Dasa]] in the 17th century and a work by the same name by Maguni Dasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mukherjee|first=Sujit|title=Dictionary of Indian Literature One: Beginnings - 1850|year=1999|publisher=Orient Longman|isbn=978-81-250-1453-9|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCJrUfVtZxoC&amp;q=kanchi+kaveri&amp;pg=PA163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Odia language|Odia]] drama written by [[Ramashankar Ray]], the father of [[Odia language|Odia]] drama in 1880 is ''Kanchi Kaveri''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Datta|first=Amaresh|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: devraj to jyoti|year=1988|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1194-0|page=1091|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&amp;q=kanchi+kaveri&amp;pg=PA1091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kanchi Kingdom has been identified as the historical [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar Kingdom]]. As per historical records, Gajapati Purushottam Deva's expedition towards [[Virupaksha Raya II]]'s [[Vijayanagara Empire|Kanchi (Vijayanagar) Kingdom]] started during 1476 with Govinda Bhanjha as commander-in-chief. According to J. P. Das, the historicity of Kanchi conquest event is not certain.{{Sfn|Das|1982|p=120-121}}{{vn|date=June 2017}}

===Early Vaishnava traditions===
Vaishnavism is considered a more recent tradition in [[Odisha]], being historically traceable to the [[Early Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Eschmann|Kulke|Tripathi|1978}}{{sfn|Mukherjee|1981}}&lt;ref name="Panigrahi 1995 320"&gt;{{cite book|last=Panigrahi|first=K.C.|title=History of Orissa|year=1995|publisher=Kitab Mahal|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already, according to the ''Vishnudharma Purana'' (ca. 4th century), Krishna is woshipped in the form of Purushottama in Odra (Odisha).{{sfn|Starza|1993|p=76}}

[[Ramanujacharya]] the great Vaishnav reformer visited Puri between 1107 and 1111 converting the King Ananatavarman Chodaganga from Shaivism to Vaishnavism.&lt;ref name="Mittal Publications"&gt;{{cite book|first=K.K. |last=Kusuman|title=A Panorama of Indian Culture: Professor A. Sreedhara Menon Felicitation Volume|year=1990|publisher=Mittal Publications|page=166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4JqgSUSXDsC&amp;q=guru+nanak+jagannath+puri&amp;pg=PA167|isbn=9788170992141}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Puri he founded the Ramanuja Math for propagating Vaishnavism in Odisha. The [[Alarnatha Mandira|Alarnatha Temple]] stands testimony to his stay in Odisha. Since the 12th century under the influence of Ramanujacharya, Jagannath culture was increasingly identified with Vaishnavism.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1981|pp=155–156}}

Under the rule of the Eastern Gangas, Vaishnavism became the predominant faith in Odisha.{{sfn|Ray|2007|p=149}} Odia Vaishnavism gradually centred on Jagannath as the principal deity. Sectarian differences were eliminated by assimilating deities of Shaivism, Shaktism and Buddhism in the Jagannath Pantheon.&lt;ref name="Panigrahi 1995 320"/&gt; The Ganga Kings respected all the ten avatars of Vishnu, considering Jagannath as the cause of all the avatars.

The Vaishnava saint [[Nimbarkacharya]] visited Puri, establishing the Radhavallav Matha in 1268.&lt;ref name="Mittal Publications"/&gt; The famous poet [[Jayadeva]] was a follower of Nimbaraka and his focus on Radha and Krishna. Jayadev's composition ''[[Gita Govinda]]'' put a new emphasis on the concept of [[Radha]] and Krishna in East Indian Vaishnavism. And the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri]] became a place where for the first time the famous Krishnaite poem ''Gita Govinda'' was introduced into the liturgy&lt;ref name="Sahoo1988"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |surname=Sahoo |given=K.C. |title=Gitagovinda (Influence: Oriya) |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Devraj to Jyoti |editor=Amaresh Datta |year=1988 |volume=2 |place=New Delhi |publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&amp;q=PA1419 |pages=1419–1421 |isbn=81-260-1194-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea soon became popular. Sarala Dasa in his Mahabharat thought of Jagannath as the universal being equating him with [[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|Buddha]] and Krishna. He considered Buddha-Jagannath as one of the avatars of Krishna.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1981|pp=155–156}} Sometimes Jagannath venerated as [[Vamana]], the avatar of Vishnu.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=73, 76}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/june2006/engpdf/51-53.pdf |title=Jagannath—The Epitome of Supreme Lord Vishnu |author=Jayanti Rath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, the worship of [[Gopal (Krishna)]], associated with Jagannath, already flourished in Odisha. Thus the raja Languliya Narasimha Deva installed the image called ''[[Gopinath (god)|Gopinath]]'' with eight figures of [[gopi]]. And during Hera-Panchami festival, Jagannath regarded as Krishna.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1981|pp=66–67}}{{sfn|Rajaguru|1992|loc=vol 2, part 2.18. The Cult of Gopal Krsna or gopinatha}}

===Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Gaudiya Vaishnavism===

[[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] (also known as '''Chaitanya Vaishnavism'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Encounter/foreword.html Hindu Encounter with Modernity, by Shukavak N. Dasa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511154723/http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Encounter/foreword.html |date=11 May 2008 }} "&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Hare Krishna''') is a [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] religious movement founded by [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (1486–1534) in India in the 16th century. "Gaudiya" refers to the ''[[Gauda region]]'' (present day [[Bengal]]/[[Bangladesh]]) with Vaishnavism meaning "the worship of the monotheistic Deity or Supreme Personality of Godhead, often addressed as [[Krishna]], [[Narayana]] or [[Vishnu]]".

The focus of Gaudiya Vaishnavism is the devotional worship (''[[bhakti]]'') of Krishna, as ''[[Svayam Bhagavan]]'' or the Original Supreme Personality of Godhead.&lt;ref&gt;"All of the above-mentioned incarnations are either plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions of the Lord, but Lord Shri Krishna is the original Personality of Godhead." Bhagavat Purana 1:3:28&lt;/ref&gt;

Shree Jagannath has always been very close to the people of [[Bengal]]. In fact, upon visiting the main temple at [[Puri]], almost 60% of the present pilgrims can be found to be from [[Bengal]]. Besides, Ratha Yatra is pompously celebrated in [[West Bengal]], where Lord Jagannath is worshipped extensively in Bengal homes and temples. The day also marks the beginning of preparations for Bengal's biggest religious festival, the [[Durga Puja]]. This extensive popularity of Shree Jagannath among Bengalis can be related to Shree [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]].

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu spent the last 20 years of his life in Puri dedicating it to the ecstatic worship of Jagannath whom he considered a form of Krishna.&lt;ref name="Kulke 2004 150"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kulke|first=Herman|title=A History of India, 4th edition|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-32920-0|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V73N8js5ZgAC&amp;pg=PA150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahaprabhu propagated the [[Sankirtan]] movement which laid great emphasis on chanting God's name in Puri. He converted noted scholars like Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya to his philosophy. He left a great influence on the then king of [[Odisha]], Prataprudra Deva, and the people of Odisha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Edwin Francis|title=The Hare Krishna Movement: The Postcharismatic Fate of a Religious Transplant|year=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=68–71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mBMxPdgrBhoC&amp;q=chaitanya+mahaprabhu&amp;pg=PA65|isbn=9780231508438}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one version Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is said to have merged with the idol of Jagannath in Puri after his death&lt;ref name="Kulke 2004 150"/&gt;

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu changed the course of Oriya Vaishnav tradition emphasising Bhakti and strongly identifying Jagannath with Krishna.&lt;ref name="Bryant 2007 142"/&gt; His Gaudiya Vaishnav school of thought strongly discouraged Jagannath's identification with other cults and religions, thus re-establishing the original identity of Lord Jagannath as Supreme Personality of Godhead Shri Krishna.

===The ISKCON Movement===
[[File:Bhaktivedanta Swami with Jagannath in Golden Gate Park, February 1967.jpg|thumb|Shrila Prabhupada in Golden Gate Park with Jagannath deity to his right: February, 1967]]
Prior to the advent of [[ISKCON]] movement, Jagannath and his most important festival, the annual Ratha Yatra, were relatively unknown in the West.&lt;ref name="Melton 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Melton|first=Gordon|title=The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena|year=2007|publisher=Visible Ink Press|location=Jagannath|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOldV3dVOoUC&amp;q=jagannath++iskcon&amp;pg=PT374|isbn=9781578592593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after its founding, ISKCON started founding temples in the West. [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] popularly called Shrila Prabhupada, the founder of ISKCON, selected Jagannath as one of the chosen forms of Krishna installing a deity of Jagannath in ISKCON temples around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waghorne|first=J.P.|title=Diaspora of the Gods:Modern Hindu Temples in an Urban Middle-Class World|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBLFbfUrsDIC&amp;q=jagannath++iskcon&amp;pg=PA32|isbn=9780198035572}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISKCON has promoted Jagannath throughout the world.

===Jagannath in Shaktism===
[[Vimala Temple|Vimala]] (Bimala) is worshipped as the presiding goddess of the Purushottama (Puri) Shakti Pitha by Shaktas.Jagannath, is worshipped as the Bhairava, traditionally always a form of Shiva. Jagannath-Vishnu equated with Shiva, is interpreted to convey the oneness of God. Also, in this regard, Vimala is also considered as [[Annapurna (goddess)|Annapurna]], the consort of Shiva.&lt;ref name=Bimala&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tripathy|first=Shrinibas|title=Goddess Bimala at Puri|journal=Orissa Review|date=September 2009|pages=66–69|url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2009/September/engpdf/66-69.pdf|access-date=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[Tantra|Tantrics]] consider Jagannath as Shiva-Bhairava, rather than a form of Vishnu.&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jagannath.nic.in/pdf/THE%20TEMPLE%20OF%20JAGANNATHA.pdf | title=THE TEMPLE OF JAGANNATHA | publisher=Shree Jagannath Temple Administration, Puri | work=Official site of Jagannath temple | access-date=25 November 2012 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530073442/http://jagannath.nic.in/pdf/THE%20TEMPLE%20OF%20JAGANNATHA.pdf | archive-date=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Lakshmi is the traditional (orthodox tradition) consort of Jagannath, Vimala is the Tantric (heterodox) consort.{{Sfn|Starza|1993|p=20}} Vimala is also considered the guardian goddess of the temple complex, with Jagannath as the presiding god.&lt;ref name="mahapatra"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mahapatra|first=Ratnakar|title=Vimala Temple at the Jagannath Temple Complex, Puri|journal=Orissa Review|date=September–October 2005|pages=9–14|url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/sept-oct-2005/engpdf/Vimala%20Temple%20at%20the%20Jagannath%20emple%20Complex%20Puri.pdf|access-date=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagannath is considered the combination of 5 Gods Vishnu, Shiva, [[Surya]], Ganesh and [[Durga]] by Shaktas. When Jagannath has his divine slumber (Sayana Yatra) he is believed to assume the aspect of Durga. According to the "Niladri Mahodaya"&lt;ref name="Simhadeba 2001 133"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simhadeba|first=J.P.|title=Tantric Art of Orissa|year=2001|publisher=Gyan Books|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k2jr3_rSEysC&amp;q=vimala+jagannath&amp;pg=PA133|isbn=9788178350417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Idol of Jagannath is placed on the Chakra [[Yantra]], the idol of Balabhadra on the Shankha Yantra and the idol of Subhadra on the Padma Yantra.

==Jagannath and other religions==

===Jagannath and Islam===
During the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Mughal Empire]] era, Jagannath temples were one of the targets of the Muslim armies. Firuz Tughlaq, for example raided Odisha and desecrated the Jagannath temple according to his court historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Satish Chandra|title=Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals-Delhi Sultanat (1206-1526)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L5eFzeyjBTQC&amp;pg=PA216|year=2004|publisher=Mushilal Manoharlal|isbn=978-81-241-1064-5|pages=216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odisha was one of the last eastern regions to fall into the control of Sultanates and Mughal invasion, and they were among the earliest to declare independence and break away. According to Starza, the Jagannath images were the targets of the invaders, and a key religious symbol that the rulers would protect and hide away in forests from the aggressors.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=146–147}} However, the Muslims were not always destructive. For example, during the rule of [[Akbar]], the Jagannath tradition flourished.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=146–147}} However, states Starza, "Muslim attacks on the Puri temple became serious after the death of Akbar, continued intermittently throughout the reign of Jahangir".{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=146–147}}

The local Hindu rulers evacuated and hid the images of Jagannath and other deities many times between 1509 and 1734 CE, to "protect them from Muslim zeal" for destruction. During Aurangzeb's time, an image was seized, shown to the emperor and then destroyed in Bijapur, but it is unclear if that image was of Jagannath.{{sfn|Starza|1993|pp=146–147}} Muslim rulers did not destroy the Jagannath temple complex because it was a source of substantial treasury revenue through the collection of pilgrim tax collected from Hindus visiting it on their pilgrimage.&lt;ref name="cassels17"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy Gardner Cassels|title=Religion and Pilgrim Tax Under the Company Raj|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f57wAAAAMAAJ |year=1988|publisher=Riverdale|isbn=978-0-913215-26-5|pages=17–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Christian missionaries who arrived through the ports of eastern states of India such as [[Calcutta]] in the 18th- and 19th-centuries, Jagannath was the "core of idolatry" and the target of "an all-out attack".{{sfn|Kulke|Schnepel|2001|pp=159–160}} Jagannath, called ''Juggernaut'' by the Christian missionary [[Claudius Buchanan]], was through Buchanan's letters the initial introduction in America of Hinduism, which he termed as "Hindoo". According to Michael J. Altman, a professor of Religious Studies, Buchanan presented Hinduism to the American audience, through ''Juggernaut'', as a "bloody, violent, superstitious and backward religious system" that needs to be eliminated and substituted with the Christian gospel.&lt;ref name="altman30"/&gt; He described ''Juggernaut'' with Biblical terminology for his audience, called him the [[Moloch]], and his shrine as [[Golgatha]] – the place where Jesus Christ was crucified, but with the difference that the "Juggernaut tradition" was of endless meaningless bloodshed, fabricating allegations that children were sacrificed in the "valley of idolatrous blood shed to false gods".&lt;ref name="altman30"/&gt; In his letters, states Altman, Buchanan "constructed an image of Juggernaut as the diametric opposite of Christianity".&lt;ref name="altman30"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael J.

In his book ''Christian Researches in Asia'', published in 1811,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Claudius|title=Researches in Asia with Notices of the Translation of the Scriptures into the Oriental Languages|date=1811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan built on this theme and added licentiousness to it. He called hymns in language he did not know nor could read as "obscene stanzas", art works on temple walls as "indecent emblems", and described "Juggernaut" and Hinduism to his American readers as the religion of disgusting Moloch and false gods. Buchanan writings formed the "first images of Indian religions" to the American evangelical audience in early 19th-century, was promoted by American magazines such as [[The Panoplist]] and his book on "Juggernaut" attracted enough reader demand that it was republished in numerous editions.&lt;ref name="altman30"/&gt; Buchanan's writings on "Juggernaut" influenced the American imagination of Indian religions for another 50 years, formed the initial impressions and served as a template for reports by other missionaries who followed Buchanan in India for most of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="altman30"/&gt; According to William Gribbin and other scholars, Buchanan's Juggernaut metaphor is a troublesome example of intercultural misunderstanding and constructed identity.&lt;ref name=gribbin297&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gribbin | first=William | title=The juggernaut metaphor in American rhetoric | journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech | volume=59 | issue=3 | year=1973 | doi=10.1080/00335637309383178 | pages=297–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.

[[File:1 icon Hare Krishna Jagannath Krsna abstract symbol.jpg|thumb|The Jagannath symbol is a part of the Krishna iconography in [[ISKCON]] events around the world.]]
The English traveller William Burton visited the Jagannath temple. According to Avinash Patra, Burton made absurd observations in 1633 that are inconsistent with all historical and contemporary records, such as the image of Jagannatha being "a serpent, with seven heads".{{sfn|Patra|2011|pp=5–9}} Burton described it as "the mirror of all wickedness and idolatry" to the Europeans, an introduction of Hinduism as "monstrous paganism" to early travellers to the Indian subcontinent. [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]] never saw the Puri temple icon and its decorations, but described the jewelry worn by the idol from hearsay accounts.{{sfn|Patra|2011|pp=5–9}} [[François Bernier]] mentioned the Puri chariot festival, in his 1667 memoir, but did not describe the icon of Jagannath raising the question whether he was able to see it.{{sfn|Patra|2011|pp=5–9}}

According to Kanungo, states Goldie Osuri, the Jagannath tradition has been a means of legitimizing royalty.&lt;ref name="Osuri2013p55"/&gt; Codaganga, a benevolent ruler of the Kalinga region (now [[Odisha]] and nearby regions), built the extant Puri temple. Kanungo states that this endeavor was an attempt by him to establish his agency, and he extrapolates this practice into late medieval and modern era developments.&lt;ref name="Osuri2013p55"/&gt; According to him, Muslim rulers attempted to control it for the same motivation, thereafter the Marathas, then East India Company and then the British crown over the colonial era sough to legitimize its influence and hegemonic control in the region by appropriating control over the Jagannath temple and affiliating themselves with the deities.&lt;ref name="Osuri2013p55"&gt;{{cite book|author=Goldie Osuri|title=Religious Freedom in India: Sovereignty and (anti) Conversion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8lz0Mg3xx9sC&amp;pg=PA55|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-66557-5|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jagannath became an influential figure and icon for power and politics during the 19th-century colonialism and Christian missionary activity, states Osuri.&lt;ref name="Osuri2013p55"/&gt; The British government initially took over the control and management of major Jagannath temples, to collect fees and Pilgrim Tax from Hindu who arrived from all over the Indian subcontinent to visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ingham | first=Kenneth | title=The English Evangelicals and the Pilgrim Tax in India, 1800–1862 | journal=The Journal of Ecclesiastical History | volume=3 | issue=2 | year=1952 | doi=10.1017/s0022046900028426 | pages=191–200| s2cid=163518878 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Claudius Buchanan mentions the Pilgrim Tax was collected from Hindus after they had walked very long distances, for many weeks, to visit the Puri temple.

Between 1856 and 1863, the British government accepted the missionary demand and handed over the Jagannath temples to the Hindus.&lt;ref name="Osuri2013p55"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Peggs|title=Pilgrim Tax in India: The Great Temple in Orissa, Second edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASFYAAAAcAAJ|year=1830|publisher=London: Seely, Fleet-Street}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cassels and Mukherjee, the British rule documents suggest that the handing over was more motivated by the growing Hindu agitation against the Pilgrim Tax that they considered as discriminatory targeting based on religion, and rising corruption among the British officials and their Indian assistants, in the handling of collected tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nancy Gardner Cassels|author2=Sri Prabhat Mukherjee|title=Pilgrim Tax and Temple Scandals: A Critical Study of the Important Jagannath Temple Records During British Rule|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=E293AAAAMAAJ|year= 2000|publisher= Orchid|isbn=978-974-8304-72-4|pages= 96–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N.

To colonial era Hindu nationalists in the late 19th-century and 20th-century, Jagannath became a unifying symbol which combined their religion, social and cultural heritage into a political cause of self-rule and freedom movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goldie Osuri|title=Religious Freedom in India: Sovereignty and (anti) Conversion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8lz0Mg3xx9sC&amp;pg=PA55|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-66557-5|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratha Yatra is most significant of all festivals of Jagannath.

===Ratha Yatra===
{{main|Ratha Yatra (Puri)}}
[[File:Rath Yatra Puri 2007 11071.jpg|thumb|Rath Yatra in Puri (2007).]]
The Jagannath triad are usually worshipped in the sanctum of the temple, but once during the month of [[Asadha]] (rainy season of [[Odisha]], usually falling on the month of June or July), they are brought out onto the Bada Danda (Puri's main high street) and travel 3&amp;nbsp;km to the Shri [[Gundicha Temple]], in huge chariots, allowing the public to have [[Darśana|Darshan]] (i.e., holy view). This festival is known as Ratha Yatra, meaning the festival (''yatra'') of the chariots (''ratha''). The ''rathas'' are huge wheeled wooden structures, which are built anew every year and are pulled by the devotees. The chariot for Jagannath is approximately {{convert|45|ft|order=flip}} high and {{convert|35|sqft|order=flip}} and takes about 2 months to construct.{{Sfn|Starza|1993|p=16}} The artists and painters of Puri decorate the cars and paint flower petals etc. on the wheels, the wood-carved charioteer and horses, and the inverted lotuses on the wall behind the throne.{{Sfn|Das|1982|p=40}} The huge chariot of Jagannath pulled during Ratha Yatra is the etymological origin of the English word ''[[juggernaut]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Juggernaut, definition and meaning|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/juggernaut|publisher=Merriam Webster Dictionary|access-date=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ratha Yatra is also termed as the Shri Gundicha Yatra.

The most significant ritual associated with the Ratha Yatra is the ''chhera pahara''. During the festival, the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati king]] wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots in the ''Chera Pahara'' (Sweeping with water) ritual. The Gajapati king cleanses the road before the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder with utmost devotion. As per the custom, although the Gajapati king has been considered the most exalted person in the [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalingan]] kingdom, still he renders the menial service to Jagannath. This ritual signified that under the lordship of Jagannath, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign, the Gajapati king, and the most humble devotee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Karan |first=Jajati |title=Lord Jagannath yatra to begin soon |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/world-twenty20-west-indies-thrash-australia-by-74-runs-will-face-sri-lanka-in-the-final/68263-13.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629121328/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/world-twenty20-west-indies-thrash-australia-by-74-runs-will-face-sri-lanka-in-the-final/68263-13.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 June 2013 |access-date=28 November 2012 |newspaper=IBN Live |date=4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chera pahara'' is held on two days, on the first day of the Ratha Yatra, when the deities are taken to the garden house at [[Mausi Maa Temple]] and again on the last day of the festival, when the deities are ceremoniously brought back to the Shri Mandir.

As per another ritual, when the deities are taken out from the Shri Mandir to the chariots in ''Pahandi vijay'', disgruntled devotees hold a right to offer kicks, slaps and make derogatory remarks to the images, and Jagannath behaves like a commoner.

In the Ratha Yatra, the three deities are taken from the Jagannath Temple in the chariots to the Gundicha Temple, where they stay for seven days. Thereafter, the deities again ride the chariots back to Shri Mandir in ''bahuda yatra''. On the way back, the three chariots stop at the Mausi Maa Temple and the deities are offered ''poda pitha'', a kind of baked cake which are generally consumed by the poor sections only.

The observance of the Ratha Yatra of Jagannath dates back to the period of the Puranas.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Vivid descriptions of this festival are found in Brahma Purana, Padma Purana and Skanda Purana. Kapila Samhita also refers to Ratha Yatra. During the [[Mughal Empire|Moghul]] period, King Ramsingh of Jaipur, Rajasthan, has also been described as organizing the Ratha Yatra in the 18th century. In Odisha, kings of [[Mayurbhanj District|Mayurbhanj]] and [[Parlakhemundi]] also organized the Ratha Yatra, though the most grand festival in terms of scale and popularity takes place at Puri.

In fact, Starza{{sfn|Starza|1993|p=133}} notes that the ruling [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Ganga dynasty]] instituted the Ratha Yatra at the completion of the great temple around 1150. This festival was one of those Hindu festivals that was reported to the Western world very early. [[Friar Odoric]] of Pordenone visited India in 1316–1318, some 20 years after [[Marco Polo]] had dictated the account of his travels while in a [[Genoa|Genovese]] prison.{{Sfn|Mitter|1977|p=10}} In his own account of 1321, Odoric reported how the people put the "[[cult image|idol]]s" on chariots, and the king and queen and all the people drew them from the "church" with song and music.{{Sfn|Starza|1993|p=129}} {{Sfn|Das|1982|p=48}}

The [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Temple of Jagannath at Puri]] is one of the major Hindu temples in India. The temple is built in the [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] style of architecture, with the [[Pancharatha]] (Five chariots) type consisting of two anurathas, two konakas and one ratha. Jagannath temple is a pancharatha with well-developed pagas. 'Gajasimhas' (elephant lions) carved in recesses of the pagas, the 'Jhampasimhas' (Jumping lions) are also placed properly. The perfect pancharatha temple developed into a Nagara-rekha temple with unique Oriya style of subdivisions like the Pada, Kumbha, Pata, Kani and Vasanta. The Vimana or the apsidal structure consists of several sections superimposed one over other, tapering to the top where the [[Amalaka]]shila and Kalasa are placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Architecture of Jagannath temple|url=http://www.jagannath.nic.in/architecture.asp|publisher=Jagannath temple, Puri|access-date=28 November 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120171916/http://jagannath.nic.in/architecture.asp|archive-date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jagannath Temple (Puri)|Temple of Jagannath at Puri]] has four distinct sectional structures, namely -
# Deula or [[Vimana]] ([[Sanctum sanctorum]]) where the triad deities are lodged on the ratnavedi (Throne of Pearls);
# Mukhashala (Frontal porch);
# [[Nata mandir]]/Natamandapa, which is also known as the [[Jaga mohan]], (Audience Hall/Dancing Hall), and
# Bhoga Mandapa (Offerings Hall).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.7wonders.org/wonders/asia/india/puri/jagannath-temple.aspx |title=Jagannath Temple, India - 7 wonders |work=7wonders.org |year=2012 |quote=The temple is divided into four chambers: Bhogmandir, Natamandir, Jagamohana and Deul |access-date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1 Jagganath temple Ranchi Jharkhand.jpg|thumb|left|The Jagganath temple in Ranchi, [[Jharkhand]]]]
The temple is built on an elevated platform, as compared to [[Lingaraja temple]] and other temples belonging to this type. This is the first temple in the history of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalingaan]] temple architecture where all the chambers like Jagamohana, Bhogamandapa and Natyamandapa were built along with the main temple. There are miniature shrines on the three outer sides of the main temple.

The Deula consists of a tall shikhara (dome) housing the [[sanctum sanctorum]] ([[garbhagriha]]). A pillar made of fossilized wood is used for placing lamps as offering. The Lion Gate (Singhadwara) is the main gate to the temple, guarded by two guardian deities [[Jaya-Vijaya|Jaya and Vijaya]]. A 16-sided, {{convert|11|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} [[granite]] monolithic columnar pillar known as the Aruna Stambha (Solar Pillar) bearing [[Aruṇa|Aruna]], the charioteer of [[Surya]], faces the Lion Gate. This column was brought here from the Sun temple of [[Konark]].

There is a temple situated in [[Mahesh, Serampore]] in West Bengal, which is famous for [[Rathayatra of Mahesh]].

The temple's historical records Madala panji maintains that the temple was originally built by King Yayati of the [[Somavaṃśī dynasty|Somavamsi]] dynasty on the site of the present shrine. However, the historians question the veracity and historicity of the Madala Panji. As per historians, the Deula and the Mukhashala were built in the 12th century by Ganga King Anangabheemadeva, the grandson of [[Anantavarman Chodaganga]] and the Natamandapa and Bhogamandapa were constructed subsequently during the reign of Gajapati Purushottama Deva (1462–1491) and Prataprudra Deva (1495–1532) respectively. According to Madala Panji, the outer prakara was built by Gajapati Kapilendradeva (1435–1497). The inner ''prakara'' called the Kurma bedha (Tortoise encompassment) was built by Purushottama Deva.

'''Himavat''' ([[Sanskrit]]: हिमवत्, lit. ''frosty'') is the personification of the [[Himalayas|Himalayan mountains]] in [[Hinduism]]. He is the guardian deity of the [[Himalayan mountains|Himalayas]], and finds mention in the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and other [[Hindu texts|Hindu scriptures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2017-03-08 |title=Himavat: 15 definitions |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/himavat#introduction |access-date=2022-10-21 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==
Various Hindu scriptures refer to the personification of the Himalayas by different names, and hence Himavat is also called '''Himavant''' ([[Sanskrit]]: हिमवन्त, lit. ''icy),'' '''Himavān''' ([[Sanskrit]]: हिमवान्, lit. ''snowy''), '''Himaraja''' ([[Sanskrit]]: हिमराज, lit. ''king of snow''), and '''Parvateshwara''' ([[Sanskrit]]: पर्वतेश्वर, lit. ''god of mountains'').

== Legend ==
Himavat fathered [[Ganga in Hinduism|Ganga]], the river goddess, as well as Ragini,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|last1=Jones|first1=Constance|last2=Ryan|first2=James D.|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816075645|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Parvati]], the second consort of [[Shiva]]. His wife and [[queen consort]] is the Vedic goddess Mainavati, the daughter of [[Mount Meru]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wil|Wilkins, p. 287]]&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Ramayana]], or is the daughter of Svadhā and her husband Kavi, a member of the class of Pitṛs, as per some other sources like the [[Vishnu Purana]].

The [[Shiva Purana]] describes the wedding between Himavat and Menā.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2018-10-04 |title=The marriage of Himācala [Chapter 1] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/shiva-purana-english/d/doc226065.html |access-date=2022-10-21 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sacred text of ''[[Devi Gita]]'', which is found in the last nine chapters (31-40) of the seventh ''skandha'' of [[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]], is a dialogue between [[Parvati]] and her father Himavat. It deals with the universal form of the ''[[Devi]]'', meditations on the major texts of ''[[Upanishad]]s'', ''ashtanga-yoga'', the [[yoga]]s of ''jnana'', ''karma'' and ''bhakti'', locations of the temples dedicated to the ''Devi'' and the rituals pertaining to her worship.

His story also finds mention in ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'' and ''[[Kena Upanishad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Kena Upanisad'', III.11-IV.3, cited in Müller and in Sarma, pp. ''xxix-xxx''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Krishna]] once performed a [[Tapas (Indian religions)|tapasya]] on the peaks of the Himalayas to appease Himavat, which led to his eldest son, [[Pradyumna]], being born to his favourite wife, [[Rukmini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2019-01-28 |title=Story of Himavān |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/compilation/puranic-encyclopaedia/d/doc241620.html |access-date=2022-10-21 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achintya is equivalent to the metaphysical concept of [[Brahman]] of Indian Hinduism, and is the Supreme God in traditional ''[[wayang]]'' ([[shadow puppet]]) theatre.&lt;ref name=hobart/&gt; All gods, goddesses and existence are believed to be the manifestation of the Achintya in Balinese Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Wiener1995p51"/&gt;

==Role==
[[File:Empty throne to the Supreme God Bali.jpg|thumb|left|Empty throne to the Supreme God]]
Achintya corresponds to a rather recent trend towards [[monism]] in Bali, according to which there is one [[Creator deity|supreme deity]], and that all other gods are only [[Avatar|manifestations]] of him.&lt;ref name=baliguide&gt;{{cite book |last1=Toh |first1=Irene |last2=Morillot |first2=Juliette |last3=Guthrie-Haer |first3=Debbie |title=Bali: A Traveller's Companion |date=2010 |publisher=Editions Didier Millet |isbn=9789814260268 |pages=45–46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4WGcgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reader |first1=Lesley |last2=Ridout |first2=Lucy |title=The Rough Guide to Bali and Lombok |date=2002 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=9781858289021 |page=97 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JlcL6HeY-uAC&amp;pg=PA97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achintya is emptiness, and considered as the origin of the Universe, all other divinities emanating from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wiener |first1=Margaret J. |title=Visible and Invisible Realms: Power, Magic, and Colonial Conquest in Bali |date=1995 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226885827 |page=51 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GE1uc1UNXNYC&amp;pg=PA51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is often associated to the [[sun god]],&lt;ref name=baliguide/&gt; and depicted in human form with flames around him.&lt;ref name=baliguide/&gt; His nakedness expresses that "his consciousness is no longer carried away by his sense-faculties".&lt;ref name=healing/&gt;

Prayers and offerings are not made directly to Achintya, but also to the other manifestations of the deity.&lt;ref name=baliguide/&gt; He is often not even represented, in which case he is only evoked by an [[empty throne]] on top of a pillar (the ''[[padmasana (shrine)|Padmasana]]'', lit. "[[lotus throne]]"), inside Balinese temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bali &amp; Lombok |date=1 May 2015 |isbn=978-1743213896 |page=26 |edition=15|last1=Berkmoes |first1=Ryan Ver }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the ''Padmasana'' as an altar to the Supreme God, was the result of a 16th-century Hindu reformation movement, led by [[Dang Hyang Nirartha]], the priest of the [[Gelgel, Indonesia|Gelgel]] King Batu Renggong (also Waturenggong), at the time when [[Islam]] was spreading from the west through [[Java island|Java]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bali &amp; Lombok |date=1 May 2015 |isbn=978-1743213896 |pages=46–47 |edition=15|last1=Berkmoes |first1=Ryan Ver }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dang Hyang Nirartha built temples in Bali, and added the ''Padmasana'' shrines to the temples he visited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bali, sekala and niskala|author=Eiseman Jr, Fred B.|date=1990 |publisher=Periplus Editions |isbn=0-945971-03-6 |page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political aspects==
[[File:Acintya at the Bali Museum.jpg|thumb|Statuette of Achintya, [[Bali Museum]]]]
Since the end of [[World War II]] and the [[Indonesian War of Independence]], the [[Republic of Indonesia]] has adopted the political philosophy of ''[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]'' (literally, "The five principles"), which allows for freedom of religion. The statute, however, requires that the religion in question be [[monotheistic]], i.e., based upon the belief in a single, omnipotent deity. Under this system, six religions are recognised: [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], [[Hinduism]] and later on [[Confucianism]].&lt;ref name=eiseman&gt;{{cite book |title=Bali, sekala and niskala|author=Eiseman Jr, Fred B.|date=1990 |publisher=Periplus Editions |isbn=0-945971-03-6 |pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To comply with regulations, Balinese Hindus have felt the need to reinforce the monotheistic component of the faith, thus the more emphasised role of Achintya.&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel, June (2013), A Modern Hindu Monotheism: Indonesian Hindus as 'People of the Book'. The Journal of Hindu Studies, Oxford University Press, {{doi|10.1093/jhs/hit030}}&lt;/ref&gt; To refer to him, they selected the term '''Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa''' (glossed as "God Almighty"), which although coined in the 1930s by Protestant missionaries to describe the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]], was thought to be well-adapted to describe the Hindu supreme deity.&lt;ref name=eiseman/&gt; This is thus the name which is now more commonly used by modern Balinese.&lt;ref name=baliguide/&gt;

'''Ayyappan''', also called '''Dharmasastha''' and '''Manikandan,''' is a [[Hindu]] deity popular in [[Southern India]]. He is considered to be the epitome of dharma, truth, and righteousness and is often called upon to obliterate evil.

Although devotion to Ayyappan has been prevalent earlier in South India, his popularity rose only in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Suresh|last=Chandra|year=1998|title=Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mfTE6kpz6XEC|publisher=Sarup and Sons|page=28|isbn=8176250392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CushRobinson2008p78" /&gt; According to Hindu theology, he is the son of [[Harihara]] ([[Vishnu]] in the form of [[Mohini]], and [[Shiva]]).&lt;ref name="CushRobinson2008p78"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Denise Cush|author2=Catherine A.

The iconography of Ayyappan depicts him as a handsome celibate ([[Brahmacharya|Brahmachari]]) deity doing yoga and as an epitome of [[Dharma]], who wears a bell around his neck. In the Hindu tradition popular in the Western Ghats of India, he was born with the powers of Shiva and Vishnu to confront and defeat the shape-shifting evil Buffalo demoness Mahishi. He was raised by a childless royal couple Rajashekara pandiyan and Koperundevi, and grows up as a warrior [[yogi]] champion of ethical and dharmic living.&lt;ref name=bri/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D.

Ayyappan's popularity has grown in many parts of India, and the most prominent Ayyappan shrine is at [[Sabarimala]], nestled in the hills of [[Pathanamthitta]] of [[Kerala]]. The shrine receives millions of pilgrims every year in late December and early January, many of whom prepare for weeks before and then climb the hill barefoot,&lt;ref name=Quinn/&gt; making it one of the largest active pilgrimage sites in the world.{{sfn|Younger|2002|pp=22–24}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Press Trust of India|title=Safety Manual for Sabarimala prepared|url=http://expressbuzz.com/topic/safety-manual-for-sabarimala-to-be-prepared/287323.html|access-date=13 July 2011|newspaper=The New Indian Express|date=June 23, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083502/http://expressbuzz.com/topic/safety-manual-for-sabarimala-to-be-prepared/287323.html|archive-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilgrimage attracts a wide range of devotees, from diverse social or economic backgrounds, except women in their fertile age because Ayyappan is believed to be the celibate deity.

==Names and iconography==
[[File:Lord Ayyappa old painting.jpg|thumb|A painting of lord Ayyapppan sitting in yogapattasana]]
[[File:Ayyapan(1).jpg|thumb|Ayyappan icon similar to the Sabarimala icon in a yogic position.]]
The name Ayyappan (sometimes spelled as Ayyappa or Aiyappan) may be related to as "Lord Father". The name may literally come from "Ayyan" and "Appan" both meaning "Father". The root names "Ayyan" and "Appan" denotes [[Mohini]] (Mohini here called father, she is a female form of the god [[Vishnu]]) and [[Shiva]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Williams|author2=Anthony Tribe|author3=Alexander Wynne|title=Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOLfCgAAQBAJ |year=2012| publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-1-136-52088-4|page=62}}; Contemporary scholar Peter Harvey translates the term "arya satya" (see [[Four Noble Truths]]) as "True Realities for the Spiritually Ennobled" (Peter Harvey (2013), An Introduction to Buddhism, Cambridge University Press, page 52)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the word Ayyappan is not found in South Indian versions of the medieval era [[Puranas]], leading scholars to the hypothesis that Ayyappan may have roots elsewhere. The alternate theory links it to the Malayali word ''acchan'' and Tamil word ''appa'' which means "father", with Ayyappan connoting "Lord-father".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mikhail Sergeevich Andronov|title=A Grammar of the Malayalam Language in Historical Treatment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H422cDV5qX4C&amp;pg=PA49|year=1996|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-03811-9|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bronkhorst&gt;{{cite book|author1=Johannes Bronkhorst|author2=Madhav Deshpande|title=Aryan and non-Aryan in South Asia: evidence, interpretation, and ideology; proceedings of the International Seminar on Aryan and Non-Aryan in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EOdtAAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University, Dept. of Sanskrit and Indian Studies|isbn=978-1-888789-04-1|pages=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternate proposal is supported by the alternate name for Ayyappan being ''Sastava'' (''Sasta'', ''Sashta'', ''Sastra''), a Vedic term that also means "Teacher, Guide, Lord, Ruler".&lt;ref name=bronkhorst/&gt; The words ''Sastha'' and ''Dharmasastha'' in the sense of a Hindu god are found in the Puranas.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p43"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNmfdAKFpkQC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-341517-6|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayyappan is also known as ''Hariharasudhan''&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, cited ref by author is (Sekar 2009, 479-84)&lt;/ref&gt; – meaning the "son of [[Harihara]]" or a fusion deity of ''Hari'' and ''Hara'', the names given to Vishnu and Shiva respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Younger, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; He is also called ''Manikanta'' from Mani, Sanskrit for precious stone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=maNi|url=http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=Mani&amp;direct=se|website=Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit|publisher=spokensanskrit.org|access-date=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''kanta'', Sanskrit for neck. In some regions, Ayyappa and Ayyanar are considered to be the same deity given their similar origin. Others consider him as different because their worship methods are not the same.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p43"/&gt;

Ayyappan is a warrior deity. He is revered for his ascetic devotion to Dharma – the ethical and right way of living, to deploy his military genius and daring yogic war abilities to destroy those who are powerful but unethical, abusive and arbitrary.{{sfn|Younger|2002|pp=21–25}} His iconography is usually shown with a bow and arrow upraised in his left hand, while in his right he holds either a bow or a sword diagonally across his left thigh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Joanna Gottfried|year=1981|isbn=9004064982|page=72|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-qoeAAAAIAAJ|title=Kalādarśana: American Studies in the Art of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other depictions of Ayyappan, particularly paintings, generally show him in a yogic posture wearing a bell around his neck&lt;ref name=bri/&gt; and sometimes shown riding a tiger.{{Cn|date=December 2022}}

==Life and legends==
The legends and mythology of Ayyappa varies across region like other Hindu gods and goddesses, reflecting a tradition that evolved and enriched over time, sometimes in conflicting ways.{{sfn|Younger|2002|pp=18–25}}&lt;ref name=kent83/&gt; For example, the ''Sribhutanatha Purana'' text presents Ayyappan as an incarnation of the Hindu deity [[Harihara]]putra, the son of Shiva and Mohini. This interaction between Shiva and Mohini is mentioned in the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', but Ayyappan is not mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goudriaan|first=Teun|title=Māyā divine and human|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ|year=1978|pages=42–43|chapter=The Māyā of the Gods: Mohini|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=15-heLWM3UcC&amp;pg=PA42|isbn=978-81-208-2389-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the oral tradition as represented by Malayalam folk songs, Ayyappa is presented as a warrior hero of Pandala kingdom. According to Eliza Kent, the legends in the Ayyappa tradition seem to be "artificially mixed and assembled into a kind of collage".&lt;ref name=kent83&gt;{{cite book|author=Eliza Kent|title=Lines in Water: Religious Boundaries in South Asia|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iYOiAgAAQBAJ |year=2013| publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn= 978-0-8156-5225-0|pages=80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth Vanita suggests that Ayyappan probably emerged from the fusion of a [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] god of tribal provenance and the Puranic story of Shiva and Mohini's interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbvIDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|page=94|title=Same-Sex Love in India: Readings in Indian Literature|publisher=[[Springer Publishing]]|author1=Ruth Vanita|author-link=Ruth Vanita|author2=Saleem Kidwai|author2-link=Saleem Kidwai|year=2000|isbn=1137054808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Core story===

There once was a kingdom of Pandalam where Ayyappan originated.{{sfn|Younger|2002|p=18}} The royal family was childless. One day the king of Pandalam found a baby boy in a forest.&lt;ref name=bri/&gt;&lt;ref name="CushRobinson2008p78"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quinn/&gt; The king carried the baby to an ascetic in the forest to inquire about the boy.{{sfn|Younger|2002|p=18}} The ascetic advised the king to take the baby home, raise him like his own son, and that in 12 years he would discover who the baby was.{{sfn|Younger|2002|p=18}} The royal family did so, naming the baby Manikantha.{{sfn|Younger|2002|p=18}}

}}
At age 12, the king wanted to formally invest Manikantha as the heir prince (''yuvraja''). However, the queen under the influence of an evil minister objected. The minister had advised the queen that only her younger biological child should be the next king. The younger child was disabled and lacked the ability to perform the duties of the king, something that the scheming evil minister thought would make him the de facto ruler.{{sfn|Younger|2002|p=18}} The minister persuaded the queen to feign an illness, ask for "tiger's milk" to cure her illness and demand that Manikantha be sent to get the milk from the forest. Manikantha volunteers, goes into the forest, and returns riding a tigress.{{sfn|Younger|2002|p=18}} The king, realising Manikantha's special ability recognizes the adopted son to be a divine being, resolves to make a shrine for him. For the location, Manikantha shoots an arrow that lands thirty kilometers away. The young boy then transforms into Ayyappan. The place where arrow landed is now an Ayyappa shrine, a site of a major pilgrimage that is particularly popular for visits on [[Makar Sankranti|Makara Sankranti]] (about January 14).{{sfn|Younger|2002|pp=18–19}}

The above core story is shared wherever Ayyappan is revered in India.{{sfn|Younger|2002|pp=18–22}} Sometimes the story is slightly different or extended, such as the younger son of the queen is not disabled, Ayyappan does bring tigress milk for the queen riding on a tiger, but after doing so Ayyappan renounces the kingdom, becomes an ascetic yogi and returns to live as a great warrior in the forested mountain.&lt;ref name="Pattanaik2014p109"&gt;{{cite book|author=Devdutt Pattanaik|title=Pashu: Animal Tales from Hindu Mythology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojqQBQAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-81-8475-692-0|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval interpretations===
[[File:Ayyanar with Poorna Pushkala IMG 20170813 170522 1.jpg|thumb|Dharma Shasta is a complete incarnation, worshiped as a celibate deity, but in some places one of his incarnations, Shasta is worshipped as Ayyanar along with two consorts.]]
In the medieval age, the stories of Ayyappan expanded. One story has roots between the 1st and 3rd century CE, where Ayyappan evolves to be a deity who also protects traders and merchants from enemies such as robbers and plundering outlaws.{{sfn|Younger|2002|pp=20–21}} Ayyappa came to be portrayed as a military genius. His temple and tradition inspired Hindu yogi mercenaries who protected the trade routes in South India from criminals and looters, restoring Dharmic trading practices.{{sfn|Younger|2002|pp=20–21}}

In one of the stories, Ayyappan is portrayed as a child of a priest whose father was murdered by the fearsome outlaw Udayanan. The outlaw also kidnaps a princess. Ayyappan then makes a daring rescue, attacks and kills evil Udayanan.{{sfn|Younger|2002|pp=20–21}} In another version of this story, the rulers of Pantalam themselves sent Ayyappan as a mercenary to the Pantya rulers to whom the ruler of Pantalam was related. In another late medieval era variation of the story, Ayyappan forms an alliance with the Muslim warrior Vavar against Udayanan, the basis for some devotees worshiping both in a mosque and then in the Hindu temple before starting a pilgrimage to Ayyappan shrine.{{sfn|Younger|2002|pp=20–21}}

According to Paul Younger, supplementary legends appeared in the late medieval times that linked other Hindu deities and mythologies to Ayyappan heritage.{{sfn|Younger|2002|pp=20–21}} One such story links Ayyappan to the buffalo-demon Mahishasura and buffalo-demoness Mahishasuri. The divine beings [[Dattatreya|Datta]] and Lila came to earth as humans. Datta wanted to return to the divine realm, but Lila enjoyed her life on earth and Datta's company. She wanted to stay on earth.{{sfn|Younger|2002|p=21}} Datta became angry and cursed her to become a Mahishi, or water buffalo demoness. Lila in turn cursed him to become a Mahisha, or water buffalo demon. They plundered earth with their evil acts. The water buffalo demon Mahishasura was killed by goddess [[Durga]], while the water demoness Mahishasuri was killed by Ayyapan, ending the terror of evil and liberating divine Lila who was previously cursed.{{sfn|Younger|2002|pp=21–22}} These legends, states Younger, syncretically link and combine various Hindu traditions around Shiva ([[Shaivism]]), Vishnu ([[Vaishnavism]]) and [[Devi]] ([[Shaktism]]).{{sfn|Younger|2002|pp=21–22}}

== Temples ==
[[File:Sri Ayyappa Swamy Temple at Koduru, Krishna District.jpg|thumb|Sri Ayyappa Swamy Temple at Koduru, Krishna District, [[Andhra Pradesh]]. The entrance shows Ayyappan riding a tiger.]]
There are many [[Temple|temples]] in [[Kerala]] whose presiding deity is Ayyappan, the most famous among them being the [[Sabarimala]] temple. Padinettam Padi Karuppan is Guardian Of [[Ayyappan Temple|Ayyappan temple]]. The temple attracts millions of visitors every year during mandala season from mid November to mid January. Other important temples are [[Kulathupuzha Sastha Temple]], [[Aryankavu Sastha Temple]], [[Achankovil Sree Dharmasastha Temple]], [[Erumely Sree Dharmasastha Temple]] and [[Ponnambalamedu]] Temple.{{Cn|date=December 2022}}

Ayyappan temples typically show him as a celibate yogi. A few important temples such as the one at [[Achankovil Sree Dharmasastha Temple]] near Travancore, however, depict him as a married man with two wives Poorna and Pushkala, as well as a son ''Satyaka''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K.

===Sabarimala===
[[File:Sabarimala pilgrims walking.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Ayyappan pilgrims walking barefoot to the Sabarimala shrine.]]
Ayyappan has roots in Kerala, but his influence and popularity have grown among the Hindus in South Indian states. Of his many temples, the most significant is at [[Sabarimala]] (also spelled Sabarimalai), set in the forests of the Pathanamthitta district in the Western Ghats on the banks of river Pamba, southeast of [[Kottayam]]. It is a major pilgrimage, attracting millions of Hindus every year, particularly of Malayali, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu heritage.&lt;ref name="Smith1978p3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Clothey|editor=Bardwell L.

Many begin preparations months in advance by leading a simple life, doing yoga, abstaining from sex, eating a vegetarian diet or partially fasting, wearing black or blue or ''[[sadhu]]''-style dress for forty one days, then trekking as a group to the shrine. The group does not recognize any form of social or economic discrimination such as caste, and all devotees form a fraternity welcoming each other as equals.&lt;ref name="Smith1978p3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kent2013p14"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eliza Kent|title=Lines in Water: Religious Boundaries in South Asia|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iYOiAgAAQBAJ |year=2013| publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn= 978-0-8156-5225-0|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eck2012p13"/&gt; The pilgrims call each other by the same name during the trek: ''swami''.&lt;ref name="Eck2012p13"&gt;{{cite book|author=Diana L Eck|author-link=Diana L.

To keep the human traffic organized, Ayyappan devotees reserve and are assigned a pilgrimage day from one of the 51 days of pilgrimage, and each day sees over 100,000 walking pilgrims. Women of menstruating age (between the ages of 10-50) were strictly prohibited in the temple until 2018. This was said to be due to the belief that Lord Ayyappan is a [[Brahmacharya|Brahmachari]] (celibate) deity.&lt;ref name=bri/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith1978p3"/&gt;{{sfn|Younger|2002|pp=18–23}} The Supreme Court of India ruled on 28 September 2018 that [[Entry of women to Sabarimala|women could not be prohibited from entering the temple]]. This led to violent protests.{{Cn|date=December 2022}}

The devotees wear simple dress on the day of the pilgrimage up the hills and through the forest, many go barefoot, carry ''irumudi'' (a walking stick for regional Hindu yogis with two compartment little bag sometimes carried on head), wear Tulasi leaves and Rudraksha beads around their neck (symbolism for Vishnu and Shiva) while fellow Hindus gather along the trek path, cheering and helping them complete their journey.&lt;ref name="Smith1978p3" /&gt;{{sfn|Younger|2002|pp=18–23}} For the Ayyappan pilgrims, states E.

The 2021 movie [[The Great Indian Kitchen]] prominently features a family of devotees of Ayyappan. The 2023 movie [[Malikappuram]] features the journey of a 10-year old girl to [[Sabarimala Temple|Sabarimala]].

He is otherwise also called as "Dharmaraja".

== Worship of Yama as creator ==

There is a '''Chitral''' district by the [[Chitral]] river in the '''Swat(Suvastu)''' region in the north-western Indian subcontinent. The language spoken amongst others are ''Chitrali'' and [[Chitral Kalasha language|Kalash]]. Of note is the fact that even in the remaining currently practiced form of ancient Hinduism in the region, certain deities were revered either in one community/tribe or other. Only one was universally revered as the Creator that is the ancient Hindu god Yama Râja called imr'o in Kâmviri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guillard, J.M.|title=Seul chez les Kalash. Carrefour des Lettres.|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient region had historical and cultural links to the nearby regions of Gilgit-Baltistan, Kashmir and Nooristan. The Srivastu/Suvastu region is also said to be the place of origin of [[Srivastava]] clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopaedia Indica: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh: Volume 100 | editor = S.

==Hinduism==
{{Main|Yama (Hinduism)}}
[[File:Bhuvanesvar002.jpg|thumb|225x225px|Yamaraj depicted with a buffalo and surrounded by attendants.]]
'''Yama''' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: यम), is the Hindu god of Death and [[Justice]], and is responsible for the dispensation of [[Ṛta|law]] and punishment of sinners in his abode, [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Yamaloka]]. Yama is also one of the oldest deities in the pantheon and some of his earliest appearances are found in the [[Rigveda]]. From there, he has remained a significant deity, appearing in some of the most important texts of Hinduism which include the ''[[Ramayana]]'', the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and the ''[[Puranas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Yama: The History of an Ancient God|url=http://citragupta.com/yama-the-history-of-an-ancient-god.html|access-date=2021-03-17|website=Citragupta|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Yama|url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Yama/|access-date=2021-03-17|website=World History Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yama is also one of the [[Lokapala]]s (guardians of the directions), appointed as the protector of the southern direction. Yama is described as having four arms, protruding fangs, and complexion of storm clouds with a wrathful expression; surrounded by a garland of flames; dressed in red, yellow, or blue garments; riding a water-buffalo and holding a sword, noose and a mace to capture the souls of those who have sinned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Warrier |first1=Shrikala |title=Kamandalu: The Seven Sacred Rivers of Hinduism |date=December 20, 2014 |publisher=Mayur University London; First edition |isbn=978-0953567973 |pages=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legends describe him as the twin of [[Yamuna in Hinduism|Yamuna]], a river goddess associated with life, and the son of the Sun god [[Surya]] and [[Saranyu]]. Other than Yamuna, he also has many siblings, such as the [[Ashvins]], [[Shani]], [[Shraddhadeva Manu]], [[Revanta]] and [[Tapati]]. Some of his major appearances include in the tales of the [[Pandavas]], [[Savitri and Satyavan|Savitri Satyavan]] and the sage [[Markandeya]]. His assistant is [[Chitragupta]], another deity associated with death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2017-12-05|title=Lord Chitragupta - Who helps Lord Yamaraj to maintain karmic accounts|url=https://detechter.com/lord-chitragupta-who-helps-lord-yamaraj-to-maintain-karmic-accounts/|access-date=2021-03-17|website=Detechter|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Yama (Buddhism)}}In [[Buddhism]], '''Yama''' ([[Sanskrit]]: यम) is a [[dharmapala]], a wrathful god or the Enlightened Protector of Buddhism that is considered worldly,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.himalayanart.org/search/set.cfm?setID=2404|title=Buddhist Protectors, Wisdom Deities (Dharmapala).|website=Himalayan Art Resources|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; said to judge the dead and preside over the [[Naraka]]s ("[[Hell]]" or "[[Purgatory]]") and the cycle of [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].

The Buddhist Yama has, however, developed different myths and different functions from the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity. In Pali Canon Buddhist myths, Yama takes those who have mistreated elders, holy spirits, or their parents when they die. Contrary though, in the [[Majjhima Nikaya]] commentary by [[Buddhaghoṣa|Buddhagosa]], Yama is a vimānapeta – a [[preta]] with occasional suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Brief History of the Immortals of Non-Hindu Civilizations|last=Guru|first=Shri Bhagavatananda|publisher=Notion Press|year=2015|isbn=978-1329586079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other parts of Buddhism, Yama's main duty is to watch over purgatorial aspects of [[Hell]] (the [[underworld]]), and has no relation to rebirth. His sole purpose is to maintain the relationships between spirits that pass through the ten courts, similar to Yama's representation in several Chinese religions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ghost Festival in Medieval China|last=Teiser|first=Stephen F.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1996|isbn=0691026777|chapter=The Cosmology of the Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also spread widely and is known in every country where [[Buddhism]] is practiced, including [[Buddhism in China|China]], [[Buddhism in Korea|Korea]], [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Vietnam]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Japan]], [[Buddhism in Bhutan|Bhutan]], [[Buddhism in Mongolia|Mongolia]], [[Buddhism in Nepal|Nepal]], [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thailand]], [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], [[Buddhism in Cambodia|Cambodia]], [[Buddhism in Myanmar|Myanmar]] and [[Buddhism in Laos|Laos]].

=== China ===
{{main|Yanluo Wang}}

In Chinese texts, Yama only holds transitional places in [[Hell]] where he oversaw the deceased before he, and the Generals of Five Paths, were assigned a course of rebirth. Yama was later placed as a King in the Fifth Court when texts led to the fruition of the underworld that marked the beginnings of systemizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Japan ===
Yama can be found in one of the oldest Japanese religious works called [[Nihon Ryōiki|Nipponkoku Genpō Zen'aku Ryōiki]], a literary work compiled by the Monk [[Keisai Eisen|Keikai]] in 822. Yama was introduced to Japan through Buddhism, where he was featured as a Buddhist divinity. He holds the same position title as other works depict him – a judge who imposes decisions on the dead who have mistreated others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hindu Gods and Goddesses in Japan|last=Chaudhuri|first=Saroj Kumar|publisher=Vedams|year=2003|isbn=8179360091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikhism==

In Sikhism, Yamaraja is referred to as Dharam Rai, Dharam Raj and Dharam Raja (in which, dharma is spelt as dharam instead). In Sikhism, Dharam Rai is considered to be a servant of god instead of a god, who works for god. It is believed that the [[Waheguru|supreme god, Waheguru]] had seated Dharam Rai with the task of reading out the being's deeds after the being dies and then assigns them into [[Svarga|heaven]] or [[Naraka|hell]] accordingly. After the perhaps being has spent time in [[Svarga|heaven]] or [[Naraka|hell]] accordingly, then they are assigned to re-enter the 8.4 million life-form cycle again in which they will reincarnate through various lifeforms until they re-attain the human life again. Some Sikhs interpret Dharam Raj literally, however, there are many interpretations where Dharam Raj is representative of the role of the divine judge of actions. The imagery of Yama would have been used in order to explain such a concept to followers of the Sikh Gurus who came from Hindu backgrounds: there is also imagery of the Islamic angel of death that was also used to help followers from Islamic backgrounds. Sikhism does not focus all that much on any type mythology, and rather believes that all mythologies are creations of Waheguru: thus there is not a large focus on them and their details, as Waheguru is the only being to be worshipped. Thus, within the doctrine of Sikhism, Yama represents a divine judge who reads records of people's actions: references to him are more conceptual, rather than the more literal depiction of him in Hindu scripture

Those souls who merge into god, become god, and attain full enlightenment or salvation (known as [[Moksha]] and [[Nirvana]]) will not be judged by Dharam Rai and will go into another heaven known as Sach Khand.

Also Dharam Rai is referred to as 'The Righteous Judge of Dharma' in the English translation of the Sikh scriptures. Dharam Rai also has [[Yamaduta|assistants]] that assist him.

Mentions of Yamaraja (known as Dharam Rai in Sikhism) in the Sikh scriptures:

"O Nanak, having created the souls, the Lord installed the Righteous Judge of Dharma to read and record their accounts. There, only the Truth is judged true; the sinners are picked out and separated. The false find no place there, and they go to hell with their faces blackened. Those who are imbued with Your Name win, while the cheaters lose. The Lord installed the Righteous Judge of Dharma to read and record the accounts. ||2||"
(Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Maharaj, Ang 463)

"The Righteous Judge of Dharma, by the Hukam of God's Command, sits and administers True Justice. Those evil souls, ensnared by the love of duality, are subject to Your Command. The souls on their spiritual journey chant and meditate within their minds on the One Lord, the Treasure of Excellence. The Righteous Judge of Dharma serves them; blessed is the Lord who adorns them. ||2||"
(Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Maharaj, Ang 38 and 39)

"The Righteous Judge of Dharma is a creation of the Lord; he does not approach the humble servant of the Lord."
(Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Maharaj, Ang 555)

"Remembering the Lord in meditation, you shall not be punished by the Messenger of Death. The couriers of the Righteous Judge of Dharma shall not touch you."
(Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Maharaj, Ang 185)

"The Messenger of Death and the Righteous Judge of Dharma do not even approach the beloved servant of my Lord and Master. ||6||"
(Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Maharaj, Ang 980)

===Naraka (Hindu)===
{{main|Naraka (Hinduism)}}Naraka is the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] equivalent of [[Hell]], where sinners are tormented after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dallapiccola, Anna L. (Anna Libera)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51509850|title=Dictionary of Hindu lore and legend|date=2002|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=0-500-51088-1|location=New York, NY|oclc=51509850}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hindu mythology, Naraka holds many hells,&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/sb/5/26/en2 Srimad Bhagavatam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113025849/http://vedabase.net/sb/5/26/en2 |date=13 November 2012 }} SB 5.26.3&lt;/ref&gt; and Yama directs departed souls to the appropriate one. Even elevated [[Mukti-yogyas]] and [[Nitya-samsarins]] can experience Naraka for [[expiation]] of sins.

Although Yama is the lord of Naraka, he may also direct the soul to a [[Swarga]] (heaven) or return it to [[Earth|Bhoomi]] (earth). As good and bad deeds are not considered to cancel each other out, the same soul may spend time in both a hell and a heaven. The seven Swargas are: Bhuvas, Swas (governed by [[Indra]]), Tharus, Thaarus, Savithaa, Prapithaa, and [[Maha Avatara|Maha]] (governed by [[Brahma]]).

===Naraka (Sikhism)===
[[Image:Yama's Court and Hell.jpg|thumb|Yama's Court and [[Hell]]. The Blue figure is Yama with his twin sister [[Yamuna in Hinduism|Yami]] and [[Chitragupta]].&lt;br /&gt; A 17th-century painting from the Government Museum in Chennai]]

The idea of Naraka in Sikhism is the equivalent of Hell. Naraka or hell in Sikhism is a place where sinners are given various punishments for sins. Each sin has a particular punishment. For a lustful person, there is a door to a fire chamber. There is a doorway for those who had listened to other people's gossip. They are punished by having red hot liquid iron poured into their ears. Liars have their tongues cut off. Thieves have their hands cut off.

===Naraka (Buddhist)===
{{main|Naraka (Buddhism)}}

In the Jātakas the [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Narakas]] are mentioned as Yama's abode (referred to in Pali as Yamakkhaya, Yamanivesana, Yamasādana, etc.). It is also noted that all of [[Samsāra]] is subject to Yama's rule, and escape from samsāra means escape from Yama's influence.

The [[Vaitarna River (mythological)|Vetaranī River]] is said to form the boundary of Yama's kingdom. Elsewhere, it is referred to as consisting of Ussadaniraya (Pali; Sanskrit: Ussadanaraka), the four woeful planes, or the [[preta]] realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yama |url=http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/y/yama.htm |website=Buddhist Dictionary of Pali Proper Names |access-date=2019-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naraka (Buddhism)|Naraka]] is usually translated into English as "[[hell]]" or "[[purgatory]]".  A Naraka differs from the hells of western religions in two respects.  First, beings are not sent to Naraka as the result of a divine judgment and punishment; second, the length of a being's stay in a Naraka is not eternal, though it is usually very long. Instead, a being is born into a Naraka as a direct result of his or her previous [[karma]] (actions of body, speech and mind), and resides there for a finite length of time until his karma has exhausted its cumulate effect.

===East Asian mythology===
{{main|Diyu|l1=Diyu and Jigoku}}
[[Image:Enma.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] wall-scroll depicting Enma]]
[[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] Diyu, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] Jigoku, [[Korean language|Korean]] Jiok, [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] Địa ngục literally "earth prison", is the realm of the dead or "[[hell]]" in [[Chinese mythology]] and [[Japanese mythology]].  It is based upon the Buddhist concept of [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Naraka]] combined with local afterlife beliefs.  Incorporating ideas from [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] as well as traditional religion in China, Di Yu is a kind of purgatory place which serves not only to punish but also to renew spirits ready for their next incarnation.  This is interchangeable with the concept of [[Naraka]]. In [[Chinese Buddhism]], he is also regarded as one of the ''[[Twenty-Four Protective Deities|Twenty Devas]]'' (二十諸天 Èrshí Zhūtiān) or the ''[[Twenty-Four Protective Deities|Twenty-Four Devas]]'' (二十四諸天 Èrshísì zhūtiān), a group of protective [[dharmapala]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/275253538|title=A dictionary of Chinese Buddhist terms : with Sanskrit and English equivalents and a Sanskrit-Pali index|date=2004|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|others=Lewis Hodous, William Edward Soothill|isbn=0-203-64186-8|location=London|oclc=275253538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japanese mythology, Enma-O or Enma Dai-O ({{Audio|JP GT Enma Dai-Ō.ogg|listen}}, ''Great King Enma'') judges souls in Meido, the kingdom of the waiting dead. Those deemed too horrible are sent to Jigoku, a land more comparable to the Christian hell. It is a land of eternal toil and punishment. Those of middle note remain in meido for a period awaiting reincarnation. Others, of high note, become honored ancestors, watching over their descendants.

===In Iranian mythology===
{{Main|Jamshid}}
In the [[Zend#Zend-Avesta|''Zend-Avesta'']] of [[Zoroastrianism]], a parallel character is called "[[Jamshid|Yima]]".&lt;ref&gt;F. Max Müller (Editor): The Zend-Avesta Part III, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;
The pronunciation "Yima" is peculiar to the [[Avestan]] dialect; in most Iranian dialects, including [[Old Persian]], the name would have been "Yama". In the Avesta, the emphasis is on Yima's character as one of the first mortals and as a great king of men. Over time, *Yamaxšaita was transformed into Jamšēd or [[Jamshid]], celebrated as the greatest of the early [[shah]]s of the world.
Both Yamas in Zoroastrian and Hindu myth guard hell with the help of two four-eyed dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/iml/iml08.htm|title=Indian Myth and Legend: Chapter III. Yama, the First Man, and King of the Dead|work=sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherman2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sherman, Josepha |title=Storytelling: An Encyclopedia of Mythology and Folklore|date= 2008|publisher=Sharpe Reference|isbn=978-0-7656-8047-1|pages=118–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested by I. M. Steblin-Kamensky that the cult of Yima was adopted by the Finno-Ugrians.  According to this theory, in Finnish Yama became the god cult Jumula and Joma in Komi.{{Dubious |Finno-Ugric thing removed|reason=Is the Finnish word 'jumala' (god) the same as 'the god cult jumula'?|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuz'Mina|first1=Elena|title=The Origin of the Indo-Iranians|date=2007|publisher=Leiden, The Netherlands; Boston : Brill|isbn=978-9004160545|page=[https://archive.org/details/TheOriginOfTheIndo-iranians/page/n53 35]|url=https://archive.org/details/TheOriginOfTheIndo-iranians|access-date=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this hypothesis, from this cult, the Hungarians also borrowed the word vara which became vár 'fortress' and város 'town'. (ibid)

{{anchor|Yamadipati}}

===In Javanese culture===

There is a door-god Yamadipati in Javanese culture,&lt;ref name="Johns2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johns |first=Anthony H. |title=The Role of Structural Organisation and Myth in Javanese Historiography |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=24 |issue=1 |year=2011 |pages=91–99 |issn=0021-9118 |doi=10.2307/2050416 |jstor=2050416|s2cid=163139226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; preserved especially in [[wayang]]. The word ''adipati'' means ''ruler'' or ''commander''. When Hinduism first came to [[Java]], Yama was still the same as Yama in Hindu myth. Later, as [[Islam]] replaced Hinduism as the majority religion of Java, Yama was demystified by [[Walisanga]], who ruled at that time. So, in Javanese, Yama became a new character. He is the son of Sanghyang Ismaya and Dewi Sanggani. In the [[Wayang]] legend, Yamadipati married Dewi Mumpuni. Unfortunately, Dewi Mumpuni fell in love with Nagatatmala, son of Hyang Anantaboga, who rules the earth. Dewi Mumpuni eventually left Yamadipati, however.

===In Buddhist temples===
In [[Chinese Buddhism]], he is also regarded as one of the ''[[Twenty-Four Protective Deities|Twenty Devas]]'' (二十諸天 Èrshí Zhūtiān) or the ''[[Twenty-Four Protective Deities|Twenty-Four Devas]]'' (二十四諸天 Èrshísì zhūtiān), a group of protective [[dharmapala]]s consisting of devas adopted from [[Hinduism]] and [[Taoism]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His statue is usually enshrined in the [[Mahavira Hall|Mahavira halls]] of Chinese Buddhist temples along with the statues of the other devas.

In the Buddhism of the Far East, Yama is one of the twelve Devas, as guardian deities, who are found in or around Buddhist shrines ([[:ja:十二天|Jūni-ten]], 十二天).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emuseum.jp/detail/100031/000/000?mode=detail&amp;d_lang=en Twelve Heavenly Deities (Devas)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201634/http://www.emuseum.jp/detail/100031/000/000?mode=detail&amp;d_lang=en |date=4 March 2016 }} Nara National Museum, Japan&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, he has been called "Enma-Ten".&lt;ref name="biswas184" /&gt; He joins these other eleven Devas of Buddhism, found in Japan and other parts of southeast Asia: Indra (Taishaku-ten), Agni (Ka-ten), Yama (Emma-ten), Nirrti (Rasetsu-ten), Vayu (Fu-ten), Ishana (Ishana-ten), Kubera (Tamon-ten), Varuna (Sui-ten) Brahma (Bon-ten), Prithvi (Chi-ten), Surya (Nit-ten), Chandra (Gat-ten).&lt;ref name="biswas184"&gt;S Biswas (2000), Art of Japan, Northern, {{ISBN|978-8172112691}}, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willem Frederik Stutterheim et al (1995), Rāma-legends and Rāma-reliefs in Indonesia, {{ISBN|978-8170172512}}, pp.  xiv–xvi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Snodgrass]] (2007), The Symbolism of the Stupa, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807815}}, pp.  120–124, 298–300&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the [[Puranas]], it is mentioned that [[Sugreeva|Sugriva]], the chief of The [[vanara]] army that helped Rama (who was an incarnation of Vishnu) in [[Treta Yuga]] was the avatar of Vishvaksena.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

Vishvaksena does not appear in [[Vedas]] or the [[Dharma Shastra]] texts, but his worship is mentioned in Pancharatra and other [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agama]] texts.&lt;ref name="Nayar p. 103" /&gt; Vishvaksena is believed to symbolize the sacred Agama scriptures.&lt;ref name="Dalal p. 462" /&gt;

The twelve [[Alvars|Alvar saints]] of [[Sri Vaishnavism]] sect are considered as manifestations of Vishnu in some form, and the Alvar saint [[Nammalvar]] is considered as an [[avatar]] of Vishvaksena.&lt;ref&gt;Dalal p. 20, 270&lt;/ref&gt; The poet Bhattar, in his ''Srirangaraja Stava,'' has ''taniyans,'' or verses, praising various [[acharya]]s (teachers). Vishvaksena also has a ''taniyan'' dedicated to him in the later part of the work, incorporating him in the list of the traditional Sri Vaishnava [[Guru-shishya tradition|guru parampara]] (succession of teachers and disciples) starting from Vishnu's consort [[Lakshmi]] (Sri) to Nammalvar. This indicates the influence of Pancharatra texts on [[Sri Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref&gt;Nayar pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
[[File:Kankalamurti.jpg|thumb|upright|Shiva as ''Kankalamurti'', who defeated Vishvaksena.]]

In one myth, Vishvaksena, the son of [[Varuna]], prayed to [[Venkateswara|Venkateshvara]] at [[Tirumala]] in order to become blessed with the title of the commander of his forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Krishna |first=Nanditha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnXXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=tirupati+vishvaksena |title=Balaji-Venkateshwara, Lord of Tirumala-Tirupati: An Introduction |date=2000 |publisher=Vakils, Feffer, and Simons |isbn=978-81-87111-46-7 |pages=26 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Kurma Purana]]'' speaks of a visit of the god [[Shiva]] in the form of a cursed mendicant or beggar ([[Bhikshatana]], a form of [[Bhairava]]) to Vaikuntha. The Vaikuntha gate was guarded by Vishvaksena, who did not recognise Shiva and did not allow him to enter. Bhairava ordered his terrible attendant Kalavega to fight with Vishvaksena. However, Kalavega was defeated by Vishvaksena. As Vishvaksena charged towards Bhairava, Bhairava himself slew Vishvaksena with his [[trishula]] and impaled his corpse upon it. This form of Bhairava is known as ''Kankala'' or ''[[Kankalamurti]]'' ("One with the skeleton").&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Presence of Śiva|year=1992|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-01930-7|pages=293–4, 297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimmitt1978"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cornelia Dimmitt|title=Classical Hindu Mythology: A Reader in the Sanskrit Puranas|date=15 June 1978|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-0-87722-122-7|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==
Vishvaksena occupies an important place in the [[Vaikhanasa]] sect of [[Vaishnavism]], a sect dedicated to Vishnu. Any ritual or function begins with the worship of Vishvaksena. As the commander-in-chief of Vishnu's army, he is believed to protect the ritual or function from obstacles and evil.&lt;ref name = "tirumala"/&gt; This role is similar to that of [[Ganesha]], who generally is the first worshipped god in [[Hinduism]], especially the [[Shaiva]] (dedicated to the god [[Shiva]]) tradition.&lt;ref name="Pattanaik2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Devdutt Pattanaik|title=Shiva to Shankara: Decoding the Phallic Symbol|year=2006|publisher=Indus Source|isbn=978-81-88569-04-5|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sri Vaishnavism]], he is described as the "dispeller of difficulties" and the bearer of a moon-like shining complexion. [[Ramanuja]] remarks that the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavas]] worship Vishvaksena in the place of [[Kartikeya]] and Ganesha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ramakrishnananda |first=Swami |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmdoEAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=sri+vaishnavism+vishvaksena&amp;pg=PT41 |title=Life of Sri Ramanuja |date=2022-04-07 |publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''taniyan'' (hymn), Bhattar invokes Vishvaksena as one who facilities the life of Vishnu and Lakshmi and controls all creations by gesture of his hands to cause ''[[Cit (consciousness)|chit]]'' (conscious) and ''achit'' (not conscious) to execute their duty.&lt;ref name="Nayar p. 103"/&gt; In another hymn, Bhattar seeks happiness by appealing to Vishvaksena and his consort Sutravati.&lt;ref&gt;Nayar p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mantra and mudra===
The ''[[Lakshmi Tantra]]'' prescribe the worship of Vishvaksena and mention his [[mantra]] ''om rhum vaum jnanadaya namah''.&lt;ref name="Gupta p. 187"&gt;Gupta p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; The devotee should mediate upon Vishvaksena in the north direction.&lt;ref name="Gupta p. 187"/&gt; Before making an offering of rice to Vishnu, Vishvaksena is prescribed to be worshipped with his [[mantra]], portion of the rice offering and oblations.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta pp. 263–4&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from invoking Vishvaksena to the rites, he is also offered by the Chief Priest by reciting the ''anga mantras'' (''anga'' means "body" and "mantra" is hymns") with ''hasta mudras'' (hand gestures).&lt;ref name="Gupta p. 187"/&gt; Vishvaksena anga-mantras recited at the beginning of rites is as below.&lt;ref name="Gupta p. 187"/&gt;

"''Om rhyram hrdayaya namaha (we salute your heart)&lt;br&gt;
Om rhyrim sirasa svaha (salutation to the head)&lt;br&gt;
Om rhrum sikhayai vausat (decorate the hairstyle)&lt;br&gt;
Om rhraim havekcaya hum (decorate the hairstyle)&lt;br&gt;
Om rhraum netraya vausat (decorate the eyes)&lt;br&gt;
Om hrah astray phat.(decorate with armaments)''"

The [[mudra]] for Vishvaksena mantra, which will enable a person to be free of all human bondage, is the following form. Three fingers of the left hand including the little finger are folded into the left palm itself, the index finger is held backwards away from the thumb. On the right hand three fingers, as in the case of the left hand, are folded into the palm. Then the hand is placed on the side of the nostril. The index finger is then doubled and placed on top of the thumb. The right hand is then raised up to show the mudra of throwing a disc. With this [[mudra]], it is stated that a person can achieve freedom from the human bondage.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temple rituals===
At [[Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala|Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]] (which follows Vaikhanasa tradition), Vishvaksena is worshipped before any temple ritual. The temple for Vishvaksena is located at the northern side of the main temple, in the ''Mukkoti Pradakshinam'' ('Pradakshinam' means: clockwise [[circumambulation]]). Offerings of flowers and garlands (''nirmalya'') to the [[Tirumala Dhruva Bera|central icon]] of [[Venkateswara]] (an aspect of Vishnu) are removed from it and then offered to the Vishvaksena icon. The temple festival [[Brahmotsavam]] commences with the worship of Vishvaksena and his bronze icon is taken in procession around the temple precincts. Vishvaksena is believed to arrange for the festival and ensure that it goes on smoothly.&lt;ref name="tirumala"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tirumala.org/maintemple_tour_vishwaksena.htm|title=Sri Vishwaksena Temple|access-date=1 January 2013|publisher=Official website of Turumala Tirupati Devastahanams.

The ritual of offering of remnants of [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] offerings to the central or festival icon of Vishnu to Vishvaksena, before closing of the temple doors, is embedded in Pancharatra tradition. The poet Kuresha remarks that Vishvaksena sustains on the remnants of his master's food, which is a sign of approval of his master.&lt;ref&gt;Nayar p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam|Srirangam temple]], dedicated to [[Ranganatha]] (an aspect of Vishnu), also celebrates similar festivals where Vishvaksena plays a role in the temple festivals. On the first day of the festival, images of Vishvaksena and [[Hanuman]] are paraded to the shrine of [[Ranganayaki]], the presiding consort goddess of the temple. Soil from a holy [[Aegle marmelos|bael]] tree and from the banks of the [[Kaveri]] river are brought by priests, as though collected by the deities and seeds are sown in this soil as part of the ''Ankurarpanam'' (sprouting the seeds) ritual.

'''Manibhadra''' is one of the major [[yaksha]]s. He was a popular deity in ancient India.

==Iconography==
Several well known images of yaksha Manibhadra have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Yaksha cult and iconography, Ram Nath Misra,
Munshiram Manoharlal, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The two oldest known image are:

===Yaksha Manibhadra from Parkham===
{{main|Parkham Yaksha}}
Yaksha Manibhadra coming from Parkham near [[Mathura]], datable to period 200 BCE – 50 BC&lt;ref&gt;Costumes &amp; Ornaments As Depicted in the Early Sculpture of Gwalior Museum By Sulochana Ayyar, Mittal Publications, Dec 1, 1987, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The statue is 2.59 meters high. On stylistic grounds and [[palaeography|paleographical]] analysis of the inscription, the statue is datable to the middle of the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Luders |first1=Heinrich |title=Mathura Inscriptions |date=1961 |page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.201093/page/n179 179] |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.201093}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription says "Made by Gomitaka, a pupil of Kunika. Set up by eight brothers, members of the Manibhadra congregation ("puga")." This inscription thus indicates that the statue represents the Yaksa Manibhadra.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA365 "A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12 the century" by Upinder Singh p.365]&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Boardman, the hem of the dress is derived from Greek art. Describing a similar statue, John Boardman writes: "It has no local antecedents and looks most like a Greek Late Archaic mannerism". Similar folds can be seen in the Bharhut Yavana.&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bharhut_Yavana.jpg Bharut Yavana] (John Boardman, "The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity", Princeton University Press, 1993, p.112.)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Yaksha Manibhadra from [[Padmavati Pawaya]]. The inscription under the image mentions a group of Manibhadra worshippers.

Both of them are monumental larger than life sculptures, often dated to [[Maurya]] or [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] period. The Parkham Yaksha was used an inspiration by [[Ram Kinker Baij]] to carve the Yaksha image that now stands in front of the [[Reserve Bank of India]] in [[Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;Of Art, Central Banks, and Philistines, RBI History Project, http://www.rbi.org.in/History/Mis_Ane_OfArtCentralBankers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Manibhadra was often shown with a bag of money in his hand.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Hinduism==
Manibhadra was a son of [[Kubera]] and his wife, [[Bhadra]]. He had a brother named [[Nalakuvara]]. In Ramayana, Manibhadra fought with [[Ravana]] to defend Lanka but failed.&lt;ref&gt;Ramayana: King Rama's Way, William Buck, Barend A. Van Nooten, Shirley Triest, University of California Press, Nov 1, 2000, p. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Mahabharata]] Manibhadra is mentioned along with [[Kubera]] as a chief of the yakshas. Arjuna had worshipped him.&lt;ref&gt;Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide,  Roshen Dalal, Penguin Books India, Oct 5, 2011, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bhagvatam]] narrates a story about the brothers. Once Manibhadra and Nalakuvara were playing with their respective wife or [[apsara]]s in the river Ganges. They were drunk and nude. When god sage, [[Narada]] passed by to visit Vishnu, the women covered themselves but the nude brothers were too intoxicated to see the sage and started to boast about themselves. Narada wanted to teach the brothers a lesson and cursed them to be turned into trees and only to be liberated by [[Vishnu]] avatar. During Dwapada Yuga, an infant [[Krishna]] was tied to a mortar by his mother, [[Yashoda]] as a punishment for eating dirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Prabhupada|first1=His Divine Grace A. C.

Krishna using his divine powers uprooted the trees, liberating Nalakuvara and Manigriva from their curse.
===Other legends===
Another figure with the same name is mentioned to be an avatar of [[Shiva]] which he called when he was angry and summoned for warfare. Manibhadra decimated the army of [[Jalandhara]] along with [[Virabhadra]], another avatar of Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/hmvp/hmvp43.htm|title = Hindu Mythology, Vedic and Puranic: Part III. The Inferior Deities: Chapter VI. The Asuras}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the avatar of [[Shiva]] and the chief of the yakshas may be the same Manibhadra but there is no confirmation.  Manibhadra is also a god of sea-farers especially merchants venturing out in the sea for business in faraway lands.

==Buddhism==
In Samyukta Nikaya,  Manibhadra is said to reside in the Manimala [[chaitya]]  in [[Magadha]]. Yaksha Manibhadra is invoked in The Exalted Manibhadra’s Dhārani.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sugatagarbhatranslations.com/2009/12/21/manibhadras-exalted-dharani/ THE DHĀRANI OF THE EXALTED MANIBHADRA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702022706/http://sugatagarbhatranslations.com/2009/12/21/manibhadras-exalted-dharani/ |date=2 July 2012 }}, Translated from Tibetan by Erick Tsiknopoulos&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Sūryaprajñapti]]'', a Manibhadra chairya in [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]] is mentioned. Yakshas are referred to in the ''[[Harivamsa Purana]]'' (783 A.D.) of [[Jinasena]] made the beginning of this concept.&lt;ref&gt;"Symbols, Ceremonies and Practices" by Pramodaben Chitrabhanu&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, Manibhadra and Purnabadra yakshas and Bahuputrika yakshini have been the most popular. Manibhadra and Purnabadra yakshas are mentioned a chief of yakshas, Manibhadra of Northern ones and Purnabadra of Southern ones.

Manibhadra still a yaksha worshipped by the Jains, specially those affiliated with the [[Tapa Gachchha]]. Three temples are famous for association with Mandibhadra: [[Ujjain]], Aglod ([[Mehsana district|Mehsana]]) and Magarwada ([[Banaskantha]]).  Manibhadra Yaksha (or Vira) is a popular demigod among the Jains in Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;Yakshraj Shree Manibhadradev, Nandlal B Devluk, Arihant Prakashan, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; His image can take many forms, including unshaped rocks, however in the most common representation, he is shown with a multi-tusked elephant [[Airavata]].&lt;ref name="Wiley2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kristi L.

==Connotations==
The word for [[air (classical element)|air]] (''vāyu'') or wind (''pavana'') is one of the [[Classical element#Classical elements in Hinduism|classical elements in Hinduism]]. The [[Sanskrit]] word ''Vāta'' literally means '[[:wikt:blown|blown]]'; ''Vāyu'', '[[:wikt:blower|blower]]' and ''Prāna'', '[[:wikt:breathing|breathing]]' (viz. the breath of life, cf. the *''an''- in [[:wikt:animate|''animate'']]). Hence, the primary referent of the word is the 'deity of life', who is sometimes for clarity referred to as Mukhya-Vāyu (the chief Vayu) or Mukhya Prāna (the chief of life force or vital force).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Encyclopaedia, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BSbgGLdGSRIC|page=7839|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing Pvt Ltd|year=2002|isbn = 9788177552577|quote=Mukhya Prana - The chief vital air}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the word ''vāyu'', which is more generally used in the sense of the physical air or wind, is used as a synonym for ''prāna''.&lt;ref name=Raju1954&gt;{{Citation | author = Raju, P.T. | year = 1954 | title = The concept of the spiritual in Indian thought | journal = Philosophy East and West | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 195–213 | jstor = 1397554| doi = 10.2307/1397554 | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vāta, an additional name for the deity Vayu, is the root of ''vātāvaranam'', the Sanskrit and Hindi term for 'atmosphere'.&lt;ref name="ghose1992"&gt;{{Citation | title=Tirtha, the treasury of Indian expressions |author1=Vijaya Ghose |author2=Jaya Ramanathan |author3=Renuka N.

In the ''[[Rigveda]]'', Vayu is associated with the winds, with the [[Maruts]] being described as being born from Vayu's belly. Vayu is also the first god to receive [[Soma (drink)|soma]] in the ritual, and then he and [[Indra]] share their first drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephanie Jamison|title=The Rigveda –– Earliest Religious Poetry of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1LTRDwAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0190633394|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rigveda,Mandala 1,Hymn 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hymns, Vayu is 'described as having "exceptional beauty" and moving noisily in his shining coach, driven by two or forty-nine or one-thousand white and purple horses. A white banner is his main attribute'.&lt;ref name="jansen1993" /&gt; Like the other atmospheric deities, he is a 'fighter and destroyer', 'powerful and heroic'.&lt;ref name="bhattacharji1984"&gt;{{Citation | title=Literature in the Vedic age | author=Sukumari Bhattacharji | year=1984 | publisher=K.P.

All of them are fighters and destroyers, they are powerful and heroic ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Upanishads]], there are numerous statements and illustrations of the greatness of Vayu. The ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' says that the gods who control bodily functions once engaged in a contest to determine who among them is the greatest. When a deity such as that of vision would leave a man's body, that man would continue to live, albeit as a blind man and having regained the lost faculty once the errant deity returned to his post. One by one the deities all took their turns leaving the body, but the man continued to live on, though successively impaired in various ways.  Finally, when Mukhya Prāna started to leave the body, all the other deities started to be inexorably pulled off their posts by force, 'just as a powerful horse yanks off pegs in the ground to which he is bound'. This caused the other deities to realize that they can function only when empowered by Vayu, and can be overpowered by him easily. In another episode, Vayu is said to be the only deity not afflicted by demons of sin who were on the attack. This Vayu is "Mukhya Prana Vayu".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣadbhāṣya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mEpAAAAYAAJ|page=158|author1=Shoun Hino|author2=K. P. Jog|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|year=1995|quote=Vāyu indicates Mukhya Prāṇa.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chandogya Upanishad]] says that one cannot know [[Brahman]] except by knowing Vayu as the ''udgitha'' (the mantric syllable ''[[om]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Chandogya Upanishad, Adhyaya XVIII, Verse 4; http://www.swamij.com/upanishad-chandogya.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avatars==
[[File:Vayu, the god of wind Statue at Gokarneshwor Mahadev Temple Premises, Gokarna, Kathmandu.jpg|thumb|Vayu sculpture, Gokarneshwor Mahadev Temple, Gokarna, Kathmandu]]
American Indologist [[Philip Lutgendorf]] says, "According to [[Madhva]] whenever [[Vishnu|Lord Vishnu]] incarnates on earth, Mukhya Prana/Vayu accompanies him and aids his work of preserving dharma. Hanuman the friend and helper of [[Rama]] in the [[Treta Yuga]], the strongman [[Bhima]] in [[Mahabharata]], set at the end of [[Dvapara Yuga]] and [[Madhva]] in the [[Kali Yuga]]. Moreover, since the Lord himself does not appear on earth until the end of kali age, the incarnate Vayu/[[Madhva]] serves during this period as the sole 'means' to bring souls to salvation".{{Sfn|Lutgendorf|2007|p=67}} Vayu is also known as Pavana and Matharishwa. 

In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', Bhima was the spiritual son of Vayu and played a major role in the [[Kurukshetra War]]. He utilised his huge power and skill with the mace for supporting Dharma.

* The first [[avatar]] of Vayu is considered to be [[Hanuman]]. His exploits are elucidated in ''[[Ramayana]]''. Since Hanuman is the spiritual son of Vayu he is also called Pavanaputra 'son of Pavana' and Vāyuputra. Today, Pavan is a fairly common [[Hindu]] name.
* The second avatar of Vayu is [[Bhima]], one of the [[Pandavas]] appearing in the epic the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01068.htm | title=The Mahabharata, Book 1: Adi Parva: Sambhava Parva: Section LXVII}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Madhvacharya]], is considered as the third avatar of Vayu. Madhva declared himself as an avatar of Vayu and showed the verses in [[Rigveda]] as a proof.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Dvaita School and Its literature'', pg 173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raghavendramutt.org/articles/balittha-suktha-text|publisher=raghavendramutt.org|title=Balittha Suktha -Text From Rig Veda|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924052648/http://raghavendramutt.org/articles/balittha-suktha-text|archive-date=24 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Philosophy &amp; Culture, Volume 15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xz9VcNLuyhsC|page=24|publisher=The Institute|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author C.

== Buddhism ==
In East Asian Buddhism, Vayu is a ''[[dharmapāla]]'' and often classed as one of the {{interlanguage link multi|Twelve Devas|ja|十二天}} ({{lang-ja|十二天|translit=Jūniten}}) grouped together as directional guardians. He presides over the northwest direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emuseum.jp/detail/100031/000/000?mode=detail&amp;d_lang=en Twelve Heavenly Deities (Devas)] Nara National Museum, Japan&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, he is called '''Fūten([[:ja:風天|風天]])'''. He is included with the other eleven devas, which include Taishakuten ([[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra/Indra]]), Katen ([[Agni]]), {{proper name|Enmaten}} ([[Yama]]), Rasetsuten ([[Nirṛti (god)|Nirṛti]]/[[Rakshasa|Rākṣasa]]), Ishanaten ([[Ishana|Īśāna]]), Bishamonten ([[Vaiśravaṇa|Vaiśravaṇa/Kubera]]), Suiten ([[Varuṇa]]) Bonten ([[Brahmā]]), Jiten ([[Pṛthivī]]), Nitten ([[Sūrya|Sūrya/Āditya]]) and Gatten ([[Candra]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=juuniten 十二天 |url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/j/juuniten.htm |website=JAANUS |access-date=23 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aruna''' ({{lang-sa|अरुण }}) is the charioteer of [[Surya]] (Sun god) in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p39"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the elder brother of [[Garuda]]. Aruna and Garuda are the sons of Vedic sage [[Kashyapa]] and his wife [[Vinata]], daughter of Prajapati [[Daksha]]. His children were [[Sampati]] and [[Jatayu]]. He is also found in [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] literature and arts.

== Mythology ==

=== Birth ===
Aruna is found in different, inconsistent Indian legends. In the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'',&lt;ref name = "mani55"&gt;Mani p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; he was born prematurely and partially developed from an egg. According to this version, [[Kashyapa]] [[Prajapati]]'s two wives [[Vinata]] and [[Kadru]] wanted to have children. Kashyapa granted them a boon.&lt;ref name="Williams2008p62"&gt;{{cite book |author=George M. Williams |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7LOZfwCDpEC |title=Handbook of Hindu Mythology |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-19-533261-2 |pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadru asked for one thousand 'Dirghadeha' (meaning long bodied) [[Nāga]] (serpent) sons, while Vinata wanted only two yet extremely strong 'Divyadeha' (meaning emitting golden aura from body). Kashyapa blessed them, and then went away to a forest. Later, Kadru gave birth to one thousand eggs, while Vinata gave birth to two eggs. These incubated for five hundred years, upon which Kadru broke the eggs open and out came her 1,000 sons. Vinata eager for her sons, broke one of the eggs from which emerged the partially formed Aruna. Since Aruna was born prematurely, his body was partially developed. Enraged by the haste of his mother, he cursed her that she will become the slave of Kadru for 500 years, when the second egg will break and his son will redeem her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Mahabharata, Book 1: Adi Parva: Astika Parva: Section XVI |url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01017.htm |access-date=2022-05-24 |website=www.sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having cursed his mother, Aruna disappeared. He was bestowed to be the charioteer to Surya by his father, Prajapati Kasyapa. Accordingly, Vinata waited, and later the fully developed mighty eagle, her second born named [[Garuda]] (vehicle of [[Vishnu]]) was born.&lt;ref name="Williams2008p62"/&gt;

The epic narrates that in another tale that Surya began burning intensely angered by the attacks of [[Rahu]] (Rahu swallowing Surya is described to cause [[solar eclipse]]s in Hindu mythology). The heat was so intense that it started destroying all living beings. The god [[Brahma]] asked Aruna to become the charioteer of Surya, to shelter beings from Surya's burning heat.&lt;ref name = "mani55"/&gt;

=== In the epics ===
According to the ''[[Ramayana]]'', Aruna was married to Shyeni&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Sanskrit - Dictionary |url=https://www.learnsanskrit.cc/translate?search=shyenI&amp;dir=se |access-date=2022-05-24 |website=www.learnsanskrit.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he had two sons – [[Jatayu]] and [[Sampati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dalal|first=Roshen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87k0AwAAQBAJ&amp;q=aruna+shyeni&amp;pg=PT196|title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths|date=2014-04-18|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=978-81-8475-396-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of his sons played important role in the epic.

There is a legend about Mahabharata that Surya offered Aruna and his divine chariot to his son [[Karna]] which he denied as he didn't want to rely on others to win the war, especially against Arjuna, who he acknowledged as a capable rival .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Agarwal|first=Himanshu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzCqDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=aruna+karna+chariot&amp;pg=PT100|title=Mahabharata Retold Part-2|date=2019-08-20|publisher=Notion Press|isbn=978-1-64587-785-1|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legend, generally told in Indian folk tales linked to the Ramayana, states that Aruna, once became a woman named Aruni and entered an assembly of celestial nymphs, where no man except the king of Heaven - [[Indra]] was allowed. Indra fell in love with Aruni and fathered a son named [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] from her. The next day, at Surya's request, Aruna again assumed female form, and Surya fathered a son, [[Sugriva]]. Both children were given to [[Ahalya]] for rearing, but her husband sage [[Gautama Maharishi|Gautama]] cursed them, causing them to turn into [[Vanara|monkeys]], as he did not like them.&lt;ref name = "mani55"/&gt;{{sfn|Freeman|2001|pp=201–4}}&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p39"/&gt;

'''[[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]]''' and '''[[Varuna]]''' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{IAST|mitrā́váruṇā}}) are two deities frequently referred to in the ancient Indian scripture of the [[Rigveda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Study of Deities of Rig Veda|page=44|author=S.S Gupta|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are both considered [[Ādityas]], or deities connected with the Sun; and they are protectors of the righteous order of [[Ṛta|rita]]. Their connection is so close that they are frequently linked in the [[dvandva]] compound Mitra–Varuna.


''Mitra-Varuna'' is also the title of a 1940 essay in comparative [[Indo-European mythology]] by [[Georges Dumézil]].

Murugan is widely regarded as the "God of the [[Tamils|Tamil]] people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Murugan {{!}} Tamil deity {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Murugan |access-date=2022-05-10 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2015-01-22 |title=Tracing the roots of the Tamil God |language=en-IN |work=The Hindu |url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/society/tracing-the-roots-of-the-tamil-god/article6808508.ece |access-date=2022-05-10 |issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been postulated that the [[Dravidian folk religion|Tamil]] deity of Murugan was syncretised with the [[Vedas|Vedic]] deity of Subrahmanya following the [[Sangam era]].

The iconography of Kartikeya varies significantly; he is typically represented as an ever-youthful man, riding or near an [[Indian peafowl]], called Paravani,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=::: ENVIS :::|url=http://ecoheritage.cpreec.org/Viewcontall.php?$mFJyBfK$MkoNJ@juGYO|access-date=2021-06-19|website=ecoheritage.cpreec.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; bearing a [[vel]] and sometimes with an [[Cock flag|emblem of a rooster]] upon his banner.

Murugan is an ancient god, traceable to the [[Vedic period]]. He was hailed as 'Palaniappa' (Father of [[Palani]]), the tutelary deity of the [[Sangam landscape|Kurinji]] region whose cult gained immense popularity in the south. Sangam literature has several works on Murugan such as ''[[Tirumurukāṟṟuppaṭai]]'' by Nakkirar and ''[[Thiruppugal|Thirupugal]]'' by poet-saint Arunagirinathar. Archaeological evidence from the 1st-century CE and earlier,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; where he is found with the Hindu god [[Agni]] (fire), suggests that he was a significant deity in early Hinduism.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|p=285}} He is found in many medieval temples all over India, such as the [[Ellora Caves]] and [[Elephanta Caves]].{{sfn|Gopinatha Rao|1993|p=40}}

Murugan is found as a primary deity in temples wherever communities of the [[Tamil people]] live worldwide, particularly in the [[Tamil Nadu]] state of [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Mauritius]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]], and [[Réunion]]. The [[Six Abodes of Murugan|Aru Padai Veedu]] are the six temples of Tamil Nadu that are dedicated to him.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=1-2}} The [[Kataragama|Kataragama temple]] dedicated to him in [[Sri Lanka]] attracts Tamils, [[Sinhalese people]] and [[Vedda people]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|first=G |last=Obeyesekere | editor=Jacob Kẹhinde Olupona|title=Beyond Primitivism: Indigenous Religious Traditions and Modernity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qK5bre18YkQC&amp;pg=PA272 |year=2004|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-27319-0|pages=272–274}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also found in other parts of India, sometimes as Skanda, but in a secondary role along with Ganesha, Parvati and Shiva.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|pp=655-656}}

== Etymology and nomenclature ==
[[File:Skanda, from Kannuaj.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sculpture of the god Skanda, from [[Kannauj]], North India, circa 8th century.]]

Kartikeya means "of the Krittikas".{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|pp=655-656}} This epithet is linked to his birth. According to Hindu legends,  when Kartikeya appears on the banks of the River Ganga, he is seen by the six of the seven brightest stars of [[Kṛttikā]] [[nakshatra]] ([[Pleiades]]). These stars, personified as his mothers, all wanted to take care of him and nurse the baby Kartikeya. Kartikeya ended the dispute by growing five more heads in order to have a total of six heads so that he could look at all six mothers and let them each nurse one aspect of him.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|pp=655-656}}{{sfn|Srinivasan|1997|pp=302-303, 333-334}}

He has 108 names according to Tamil and Sanskrit folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2017-10-26|title=108 Murugar Names Tamil {{!}} 108 முருகர் போற்றி|url=https://aanmeegam.co.in/blogs/lyrics/108-murugar-names-tamil/|access-date=2021-10-19|website=Aanmeegam|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=சுப்பிரமணிய 108 போற்றி பாடல் வரிகள்|url=https://tamil.samayam.com/religion/pooja-vidhanam/lord-subramanya-swamy-108-potri-names-in-tamil/articleshow/80346661.cms|access-date=2021-10-19|website=Samayam Tamil|language=ta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kartikeya is known by many names in ancient and medieval texts. Most common amongst these are Murugan, Kumara, Skanda, and Subrahmanya. Others include Aaiyyan, Cheyyon, Senthil, Vēlaṇ, Swaminatha ("ruler of the gods", from -natha ''king''), śaravaṇabhava ("born amongst the reeds"), Arumugam or ṣaṇmukha ("six-faced"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 80|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dandapani ("wielder of the mace", from -pani ''hand''), Guha (cave, secret) or ''Guruguha'' (cave-teacher), Kadhirvelan, Kathiresan, Kandhan, Vishakha, and Mahasena.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=1, 22-25, 35-39, 49-58, 214-216}} On ancient coins where the inscription has survived along with his images, his names appear as Kumara, Brahmanya, or Brahmanyadeva.{{sfn|Mann|2011|pp=104-106 with footnotes}} On some ancient Indo-Scythian coins, his names appear in Greek script as Skanda, Kumara, and Vishaka.&lt;ref name="Edward Thomas 1877 60, 62 see e.g. coin 11"&gt;{{cite book|first= Edward|last= Thomas|title= Jainism: Or, The Early Faith of Aṣoka|url= https://archive.org/details/cu31924022953529|year= 1877|publisher= Trübner &amp; Company|pages= [https://archive.org/details/cu31924022953529/page/n95 60], 62 (see e.g. coin 11)|access-date= 28 January 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170610060016/https://archive.org/details/cu31924022953529|archive-date= 10 June 2017|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient statues, he appears as Mahasena, Skanda, and Vishakha.{{sfn|Mann|2011|pp=123-124}}

Skanda is derived from {{IAST|skand-}}, which means "to leap or to attack".{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=49, 54-55}} In Kalidasa's epic poem Kumarasambhava ("The Birth of the War God"; 5th century CE), as in most versions of the story, the gods wished for Skanda to be born in order to destroy the demons Taraka, Simhamukha, and Surapadma, in which the brothers had been granted a boon that he could be killed only by Shiva's power (Skanda was purely born of Shiva). They sent Parvati to induce Shiva to marry her. Shiva, however, was lost in meditation and was not attracted to Parvati until he was struck by an arrow from the bow of Kamadeva, the god of love, whom he immediately burned to ashes. After many years of abstinence, Shiva's seed became so powerful that the gods, fearing the result, sent Agni, the god of fire, to interrupt Shiva's amorous play with Parvati. Agni received the seed and dropped it into the Ganges from which Skanda was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Skanda|title=Skanda {{!}} Hindu deity|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-04-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203193129/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Skanda|archive-date=3 December 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Textual references ==

=== Ancient ===
There are ancient references which can be interpreted to be Kartikeya in the Vedic texts, in the works of [[Pāṇini]] (~500 BCE), in the Mahabhasya of [[Patanjali]] and in Kautilya's ''Arthashastra''.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=49-53}} For example, the term ''Kumara'' appears in hymn 5,2 of the ''[[Rig Veda]]''.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=49-51}}{{refn|group=note|'''कुमारं''' माता युवतिः समुब्धं गुहा बिभर्ति न ददाति पित्रे । अनीकमस्य न मिनज्जनासः पुरः पश्यन्ति निहितमरतौ ॥१॥ कमेतं त्वं युवते कुमारं पेषी बिभर्षि महिषी जजान । पूर्वीर्हि गर्भः शरदो ववर्धापश्यं जातं यदसूत माता ॥२॥ हिरण्यदन्तं शुचिवर्णमारात्क्षेत्रादपश्यमायुधा मिमानम् । ददानो अस्मा अमृतं विपृक्वत्किं मामनिन्द्राः कृणवन्ननुक्थाः ॥३॥ क्षेत्रादपश्यं सनुतश्चरन्तं सुमद्यूथं न पुरु शोभमानम् । न ता अगृभ्रन्नजनिष्ट हि षः पलिक्नीरिद्युवतयो भवन्ति ॥४॥ (...)

But, when he lies upon the arm, the people see his unfading countenance before them. [5.2.1] What child is this thou carriest as handmaid, O Youthful One? The Consort-Queen hath bome him. The Babe unborn increased through many autumns. I saw him born what time his Mother bare him.

[5.2.4]&lt;br&gt;– Translated by Ralph T.H. Griffith, [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rig_Veda/Mandala_5/Hymn_2 Wikisource]}} The ''Kumara'' of verse 5.2.1 can be interpreted as Skanda, or just any "boy". However, the rest of the verses depict the "boy" as bright-colored, hurling weapons and other motifs that later have been associated with Skanda. The difficulty with interpreting these to be Skanda is that Indra, Agni and Rudra are also depicted in similar terms and as warriors.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=46-51}}

[[File:Kumara, The Divine General LACMA M.85.279.3.jpg|thumb|upright|Kartikeya with a [[Kushan]] devotee, 2nd century CE.]]
The Skanda-like motifs found in ''Rig Veda'' are found in other Vedic texts, such as section 6.1-3 of the ''Shatapatha Brahmana''.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=48-50}} In these, the mythology is very different for ''Kumara'', as Agni is described to be the ''Kumara'' whose mother is [[Ushas]] (goddess Dawn) and whose father is Purusha.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=49-51}} The section 10.1 of the ''Taittiriya Aranyaka'' mentions ''Sanmukha'' (six faced one), while the ''Baudhayana Dharmasutra'' mentions a householder's rite of passage that involves prayers to Skanda with his brother Ganapati (Ganesha) together.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=50-51}} The chapter 7 of the ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' (~800–600 BCE) equates Sanat-Kumara (eternal son) and Skanda, as he teaches sage [[Narada]] to discover his own [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, self) as a means to the ultimate knowledge, true peace and liberation.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=49-50}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n271/mode/2up The Thirteen Principal Upanishads] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525171448/https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n271/mode/2up |date=25 May 2017 }}, Robert Hume, Oxford University Press, pages 250-262&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Verse 7.26.2 states Kumara is Skanda, but there are stylistic differences between this verse and the rest of the chapter.

According to Fred Clothey, the evidence suggests that Kartikeya mythology had become widespread sometime around 200 BCE or after in north India.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=45-46}} The first clear evidence of Kartikeya's importance emerges in the Hindu [[Itihasa|Epics]] such as the ''Ramayana'' and the ''Mahabharata'' where his story is recited. In addition to textual evidence, his importance is affirmed by the archeological, the epigraphical and the numismatic evidence of this period. For example, he is found in numismatic evidence linked to the [[Yaudheya]]s, a confederation of warriors in north India who are mentioned by ancient Pāṇini.{{sfn|Mann|2011|pp=101-105 with footnotes}} They ruled an area consisting of modern era Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh (extending into [[Pauri Garhwal district|Garhwal]] region, Uttarakhand).{{sfn|Mann|2011|pp=101-105 with footnotes}} They struck coins bearing the image of Skanda, and these coins are dated to be from before [[Kushan Empire]] era started.{{sfn|Mann|2011|pp=101-105 with footnotes}} During the Kushan dynasty era, that included much of northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], more coins featuring Kartikeya were minted.{{sfn|Mann|2011|pp=101-105 with footnotes}} He is also found on ancient Indo-Scythian coins, where his various names are minted in Greek script.&lt;ref name="Edward Thomas 1877 60, 62 see e.g. coin 11"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Richard Mann states that Skanda-Kumara may be composite deity linked to Greek deities pair called [[Castor and Pollux|Dioscuri]] (Castor and Pollux), given the numismatic overlap in their iconography and similar warrior-god mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Benjamin|last1=Fleming|first2=Richard|last2=Mann|title=Material Culture and Asian Religions: Text, Image, Object|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kDYsAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-01373-8|pages=234–246|access-date=21 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422051359/https://books.google.com/books?id=kDYsAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234|archive-date=22 April 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kartikeya was revered in major cultural centers of ancient India. For example, he was a major god for the [[Ikshvaku]]s, an [[Andhra in Indian epic literature|Andhra]] dynasty, as well as for the [[Gupta Empire]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ratna Navaratnam; Karttikeya, the divine child:the Hindu testament of wisdom, 1973, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan&lt;/ref&gt; In south India, eight of the early [[Pallava dynasty]] rulers (300-550 CE) were named after Skanda or Kumara, suggesting the significance of Kartikeya by then.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|p=22}} Kalidasa's epic poem the ''[[Kumārasambhava]]'' features Kartikeya.

=== Puranas ===
Kartikeya is mentioned in Shaiva Puranas. Of these, the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'' is the largest ''[[Puranas#Mahapuranas|Mahāpurāṇa]]'', a genre of eighteen [[Hindu]] religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare (1996). ''Studies in {{IAST|Skanda Purāṇa}}.'' Published by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-1260-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text contains over 81,000 verses, and is part of [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] literature,{{Sfn|Bakker|2014|pp=4-6}} While the text is named after Skanda (Kartikeya), he does not feature either more or less prominently in this text than in other Shiva-related Puranas.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=114, 229-238}} The text has been an important historical record and influence on the Hindu traditions related to war-god Skanda.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=114, 229-238}}&lt;ref&gt;KK Kurukkal (1961), A Study of the Karttikeya Cult as reflected in the Epics and the Puranas, University of Ceylon Review, Vol. 19, pages 131-138&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest text titled ''Skanda Purana'' likely existed by the 6th-century CE,{{sfn|Mann|2011|p=187}}{{Sfn|Bakker|2014|pp=1-3}} but the ''Skanda Purana'' that has survived into the modern era exists in many versions.{{Sfn|Doniger|1993|pp=59-83}}

The earliest mention of Kartikeya in Buddhist texts may be found in the [[Janavasabha Sutta]] of the [[Pali Canon]], where he is referred to as '''Sanankumāra'''. Here he is introduced as a deva of the rank of Mahābrahmā and a disciple of the Buddha. The Chinese translation of the [[Dīrgha Āgama]] features the same deity with the title Brahmā[sanan]kumāra (梵童子). He is described as a manifestation of Mahābrahmārāja. He has five hair coils (頭五角髻), a handsome face (顏貌端正) and emanates purple-golden light (紫金色) that surpasses the light of the other devas. In Chinese Buddhism, [[Skanda (Buddhism)|Skanda]] (also sometimes known as [[Kumāra (Buddhism)|Kumāra]] (鳩摩羅天)) is known as Weituo (韋陀 or 韋馱), a young heavenly general, the guardian deity of local monasteries and the protector of Buddhist [[dharma|dhamma]].{{sfn|Mann|2011|p=32 with footnote 24}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela Falco Howard|title=Chinese Sculpture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGuPsNCaJdwC&amp;pg=PA380|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-10065-5|pages=373, 380–381|access-date=19 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420062102/https://books.google.com/books?id=PGuPsNCaJdwC&amp;pg=PA380|archive-date=20 April 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Henrik Sørensen, this representation became common after the [[Tang period]], and became well established in the late Song period.&lt;ref name= Henrik124&gt;{{cite book|first=Henrik|last=Sørensen|editor-first1=Charles|editor-last1=Orzech|editor-first2=Henrik|editor-last2=Sørensen|editor-first3=Richard|editor-last3=Payne|title=Esoteric Buddhism and the Tantras in East Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0XNX3N1a2AC&amp;pg=PA124|year=2011|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-18491-6|pages=124–125, 654–655 with footnotes|access-date=19 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420062150/https://books.google.com/books?id=F0XNX3N1a2AC&amp;pg=PA124|archive-date=20 April 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also regarded as one of the [[Twenty-Four Protective Deities|twenty-four celestial guardian deities]], who are a grouping of originally Hindu and Taoist deities adopted into Chinese Buddhism as [[dharmapala]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/275253538|title=A dictionary of Chinese Buddhist terms : with Sanskrit and English equivalents and a Sanskrit-Pali index|date=2004|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|others=Lewis Hodous, William Edward Soothill|isbn=0-203-64186-8|location=London|oclc=275253538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skanda was also adopted by [[Korean Buddhism]], and he appears in its woodblock prints and paintings.&lt;ref name= Henrik124/&gt;

According to Richard Gombrich, Skanda has been an important deity in [[Theravada Buddhism]] pantheon, in countries such as [[Sri Lanka]] and Thailand. The ''Nikaya Samgraha'' describes Skanda Kumara as a guardian deity of the land, along with Upulvan (Vishnu), Saman and Vibhisana.&lt;ref name="Gombrich1988p176"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Francis Gombrich|first2=Gananath|last2=Obeyesekere|title=Buddhism Transformed: Religious Change in Sri Lanka|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpN9atSFua0C&amp;pg=PA176|year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0702-0|pages=176–180|access-date=19 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420061833/https://books.google.com/books?id=rpN9atSFua0C&amp;pg=PA176|archive-date=20 April 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the 16th-century Siamese text ''Jinakalamali'' mentions him as a guardian god.

In Sri Lanka, Skanda as [[Kataragama deviyo]] (whose major shrine is at [[Kataragma]]), is a popular object of devotion among both Tamil Hindus and Sinhalese Buddhists. While many regard him as a [[bodhisattva]], he is also associated with sensuality and retribution. Anthropologist [[Gananath Obeyesekere]] has suggested that the deity's popularity among Buddhists is due to his power to grant emotional gratification, which is in stark contrast to sensual restraint that characterizes Buddhist practice in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Trainor |editor1-first=Kevin |title=Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-19-521849-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/buddhism00kevi/page/123 123] |url=https://archive.org/details/buddhism00kevi/page/123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are Buddhist Sinhala shrines such as at Kataragama dedicated to Skanda which have historically been officiated by Hindu priests, which attracted Buddhist devotees and enjoyed royal support.&lt;ref name="Gombrich1988p176"/&gt; Since the 1950s, states Brian Morris, the Kataragama shrine of Skanda has attracted over half a million devotional pilgrims every year, most being Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Brian|last=Morris|title=Religion and Anthropology: A Critical Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PguGB_uEQh4C&amp;pg=PA68|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85241-8|pages=68–69|access-date=19 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420060010/https://books.google.com/books?id=PguGB_uEQh4C&amp;pg=PA68|archive-date=20 April 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Kevin|last=Trainor|title=Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PrloTKuAjwC&amp;pg=PA123|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517398-7|pages=123–124|access-date=19 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420062439/https://books.google.com/books?id=_PrloTKuAjwC&amp;pg=PA123|archive-date=20 April 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mahayana Buddhism]], the [[Nirvana Sutra|Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]] mentions Kumāra as one of the eighty gods (八十神) worshiped by the common people. The ''[[Ārya Kaṇikrodhavajrakumārabodhisattava Sādhanāvidhi Sūtra]]'' (聖迦抳忿怒金剛童子菩薩成就儀軌經) (T 1796) features a section for the recitation of a mantra dedicated to the deity, where he is also paired with [[Iśvara]]. [[Yi Xing]]'s [[Commentary of the Mahāvairocana Tantra]] (大毘盧遮那成佛經疏) clarifies that Kumāra is the son of Iśvara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chia |first1=Siang Kim |title=鳩摩羅天 |url=http://www.buddhism-dict.net/cgi-bin/xpr-ddb.pl?q=%E9%B3%A9%E6%91%A9%E7%BE%85%E5%A4%A9 |website=Digital Dictionary of Buddhism |access-date=2019-11-05 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
According to Asko Parpola, the Jain deity [[Naigamesha|Naigamesa]], who is also referred to as Hari-Naigamesin, is depicted in early Jain texts as riding the peacock and as the leader of the divine army, both symbols of Kartikeya.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|p=285}}

== Iconography ==
Ancient coins of the Yaudheyas, dated to 1st and 2nd century CE, show Kartikeya as a warrior with either one or six heads. Kushan coins show him with one head. In general, single head is far more common regardless of which dynasty minted them.{{sfn|Mann|2011|pp=111-114}} The earliest statues discovered in Punjab and Kashmir show him with either one or six heads. The oldest sculptures such as those found in Mathura show him with one head, while six head iconography is dated to post-[[Gupta Empire]] era.{{sfn|Mann|2011|pp=113-114, 122-126}} All Kushan Empire era artwork show him with one head, even though there are Kushan deities such as a goddess who is shown with multiple heads.{{sfn|Srinivasan|1997|pp=302-303, 333-334}}

The Kushan Empire era statues of Kartikeya, dated to 1st and 2nd-century CE, have been found at various sites in the Indian subcontinent, particularly at [[Mathura]] and [[Gandhara]]. They show him as a warrior dressed in ''dhoti'' (sheet wrapped at waist, covering the legs), armour like a warrior, spear in his right hand and a bird (rooster) in his left.{{sfn|Mann|2011|pp=122-126}}{{sfn|Srinivasan|2007|pp=333-335}} There is some difference between his ancient iconography in Mathura and Gandhara artwork. The Gandhara arts show him in more a Scythian dress, likely reflecting the local dress culture prevalent in those times. Further, it is in the oldest Gandharan statues where he is shown with a bird that looks like a chicken or cock.{{sfn|Mann|2011|pp=124-126}} According to Richard Mann, the bird may symbolize Kartikeya's agility and maneuverability as a warrior god, and may be a [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] influence.{{sfn|Mann|2011|pp=124-126}} His iconography symbolizes his attributes as a hunter, warrior and philosopher.&lt;ref name=xavier167/&gt;

Kartikeya iconography shows him as a youthful god, dressed as a warrior, carrying the weapon called ''[[Vel]]''. It is a divine spear, often called ''sakti'', signifying the [[Kundalini]] ''shakti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2016-11-13|title=Significance of Lord Kartikeya and a story from Skanda Purana|url=https://wisdom.srisriravishankar.org/significance-of-lord-kartikeya/|access-date=2021-06-19|website=Wisdom by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is sometimes depicted with many weapons including: a sword, a javelin, a mace, a discus and a bow although more usually he is depicted wielding the ''sakti'' or spear. His ''vahana'' (vehicle, mount) is a peacock. He has either one head or six, depending on the region or artist.{{sfn|Mann|2011|pp=123-126 with footnotes}}{{sfn|Srinivasan|2007|pp=333-336, 515-516}}

== Legends ==
[[File:Skanda Musée Guimet 1197.jpg|thumb|upright|Skanda statues are found in [[Southeast Asia]]. Above: 6th–8th century Skanda from [[Prey Veng Province]], Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Guy|title=Lost Kingdoms: Hindu-Buddhist Sculpture of Early Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vO_-AgAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-1-58839-524-5|pages=176–178|access-date=19 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223141140/https://books.google.com/books?id=vO_-AgAAQBAJ|archive-date=23 December 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Epic era literature of ancient India recite numerous legends of Kartikeya, often with his other names such as Skanda. For example, the ''[[Vana Parva]]'' of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' dedicates chapters 223 to 232 to the legends of Skanda, but depicts him as the son of [[Agni]] and Svaha.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=50-51}} Similarly, Valmiki's ''[[Ramayana]]'' dedicates chapters 36 and 37 to Skanda, but describes him as the child of deities Rudra (Shiva) and Parvati, whose birth is aided by Agni and Ganga.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|p=51}}{{sfn|Clothey|1978|p=54}}

The legends of Kartikeya vary significantly, sometimes within the same text. For example, while the ''Vana Parva'' of the ''Mahabharata'' describes Skanda as the son of Agni, the ''[[Shalya Parva]]'' and the ''[[Anushasana Parva]]'' of the same text presents Skanda's legend as the son of Maheshvara (Shiva) and Parvati.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=50-51}}

In ''Vana Parva'', the circumstances behind Kartikeya's birth legend do not involve Shiva and Parvati.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=51-52}} Rather it is deity Agni who goes to a hermitage of seven married [[Rishi]]s (sages) and meets their seven wives. He is sexually attracted to all seven, but none reciprocate. ''Svaha'' is present there and she is attracted to Agni, but Agni is not. According to the legend, Svaha takes the form of six of the wives, one by one, and sleeps with Agni.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=51-52}} She does not take the form of Arundhati, [[Vasistha]]'s wife, because of Arundhati's extraordinary virtuous powers. Svaha deposits the semen of Agni into the reeds of River Ganges, where it develops and then is born as six headed Skanda.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=51-52}}

A totally different legend in the later books of the ''Mahabharata'' make Shiva and Parvati as the parents. They were making love, but they are disturbed, and Shiva inadvertently spills his semen on the ground.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|pp=655-656}} Shiva's semen incubates in River Ganges, preserved by the heat of god Agni, and this fetus is born as baby Kartikeya on the banks of Ganges.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|pp=655-656}}{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=49, 54-55}}

Some legend state that he was the elder son of Shiva, others make him the younger brother of Ganesha. This is implied by another legend connected to his birth. Devas have been beaten up by Asuras led by Taraka, because Taraka had a boon from ascetic celibate yogi Shiva that only Shiva's son can kill him. Devas learn about this boon, and plan how to get Shiva into a relationship. So, they bring Parvati into the picture, have her seduce yogi Shiva, and wed Parvati so that Skanda can be born to kill Taraka.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=54-56}}

Kartikeya's legends vary by region. For example, in the northern and western Indian traditions Kartikeya or Skanda is the perpetual celibate bachelor, though Sanskrit texts mention [[Devasena]] as his wife.{{sfn|Dalal|2010}}{{sfn|Varadara|1993|pp=113-114}} Kartikeya's youth, beauty and bravery was much celebrated in Sanskrit works like the [[Kathasaritsagara]]. [[Kalidasa]] made the birth of Kumara the subject of a lyrical epic, the ''[[Kumārasambhava]]''.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|p=51}}&lt;ref name="google1985"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kālidāsa|author2=C.R.

==Worship== 
=== West Bengal ===
[[File:Kartik Puja of West Bengal 2007.jpg|thumb|Worship of Kartikeya in West Bengal, with toys (right side of image)]]
In West Bengal, Kartikeya is associated with the birth of children. He is worshipped on the last day of the Month of Kartik (October–November). It has become a trend in Bengal that the clay model of the deity is kept at night before the day of worship (usually by friends) for the newly married couple before the door of their house. The deity is worshiped the next day in the evening and is offered toys.&lt;ref&gt;7 Secrets of the Goddess by Devdutt Pattanaik&lt;/ref&gt;

The deity is also worshipped during the [[Durga Puja]] festival in Bengal. Goddess [[Durga]] is accompanied by her four children [[Lakshmi]], [[Saraswati]], [[Ganesha]], and Kartikeya. Kartikeya is the youngest of them visualized as a young man, riding a peacock and wielding a bow and arrows. He is stated to be Kumara, that is, a bachelor as he is unmarried. While Ganesha is paired with the rich Lakshmi, Kartikeya is paired with the learned Saraswati.&lt;ref&gt;7 Secrets of the Goddess by Devdutt Pattanaik, {{ISBN|9789386224033}}, Durga and Saraswati's Secret (Chapter 4 &amp; 6)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nepal ===
Kartikeya is worshipped as Kumar in Nepal both by Hindu and Buddhist Communities.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} The Newah community celebrates Sithi Nakha: Festival dedicated to Sithi Kumar. Sithi Nakha (Kumar Shashthi) is celebrated on this sixth day of the waxing moon, according to the lunar calendar, in the Lunar month of Jestha. The festival is celebrated by cleaning water sources like wells, ponds and stone spouts and ending it with a grand Newah feast of six different varieties of Newarhi food including Wo or Waa (fried lintel bread) and Chatamari (Newah pizza).
The Festival is traditional Environment day as houses, courtyards, streets and allies are cleaned during this day. It is believed that cleaning such water sources will bring in rain for good cultivation of crops. It is also celebrated to welcome monsoon as this was the ideal time to set up rice seedbeds. The most of Newah communities also mark the festival as the end of Dewaali, to worship their family deities.

== Murugan == 
[[File:Murugan by Raja Ravi Varma.jpg|thumb|upright|The six-headed Murugan riding a peacock with his consorts Valli and Devasena, The peacock is seen trampling a snake by [[Raja Ravi Varma]].]]
Murugan is an ancient god, traceable to the [[Vedic period]]. He was hailed as 'Palaniappa' (Father of [[Palani]]), the tutelary deity of the [[Sangam landscape|Kurinji]] region whose cult gained immense popularity in the south. Sangam literature has several works on Murugan such as ''Tirumugratrupadai'' by Nakkirar and ''[[Thiruppugal|Thirupugal]]'' by poet-saint Arunagirinathar. Archaeological evidence from the 1st-century CE and earlier,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; where he is found with the Hindu god [[Agni]] (fire), suggests that he was a significant deity in early Hinduism.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|p=285}} He is found in many medieval temples all over India, such as the Kumaraswamy Temple Sandur &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Kumaraswamy Temple Sandur {{!}} Ballari District, Government of Karnataka {{!}} India |url=https://ballari.nic.in/en/tourist-place/kumaraswamy-temple-sandur/ |access-date=2023-01-15 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellora Caves]] and [[Elephanta Caves]]{{sfn|Gopinatha Rao|1993|p=40}}

There is extensive Hindu symbolism and theology associated with Muruga. Regardless of the variance among the legends, his birth is in difficult circumstances, he is born through a surrogate after being left near a river. He is raised not by his natural mother but a host of mothers, but later he is a part of his biological family. Muruga symbolizes a union of polarities.{{sfn|Clothey|1978|p=3}} He is handsome warrior and described as a celibate yogi. He uses his creative martial abilities to lead an army against Taraka and other demons, and described as a philosopher-warrior.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|pp=655-656}}{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=1-2}} He is a uniter, championing the attributes of both [[Shaivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]].{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=3-4}}

His theology is most developed in the Tamil texts,{{sfn|Lal|1992|p=4339}} and in the Shaiva Siddhanta tradition.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|pp=655-656}}{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=1-2}} He is described as ''dheivam'' (abstract neuter divinity, ''nirguna Brahman''), as ''kadavul'' (divinity in nature, in everything), as ''Devan'' (masculine deity), and as ''iraivativam'' (concrete manifestation of the sacred, ''saguna Brahman'').{{sfn|Clothey|1978|pp=10-14}}

According to Fred Clothey, as Murugan (also referred to as Murugan, Cheyyon), he embodies the "cultural and religious whole that comprises South Indian Shaivism".{{sfn|Clothey|1978|p=3}} He is the philosopher and exponent of Shaiva Siddhanta theology, as well as the patron deity of the Tamil language.&lt;ref name=xavier167&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

=== Legends === 
[[File:Karttikeya, God of War, Seated on a Peacock.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Basalt Murugan seated on a peacock from 12th-century [[Andhra Pradesh]].]]
According to Raman Varadara, Murugan was originally a Tamil deity, who was adopted by north Indians.{{sfn|Varadara|1993|pp=113-114}} He was the god of war and knowledge in the Dravidian legends, and became so elsewhere in the Indian subcontinent too.{{sfn|Varadara|1993|pp=113-114}} In contrast, [[G. S. Ghurye]] states that according to the archeological and epigraphical evidence, the contemporary Murugan, Subrahmanya and Kartikeya is a composite of two influences, one from south and one from north in the form of Skanda and Mahasena.&lt;ref name=ghurye152/&gt; He as the warrior-philosopher god was the patron deity for many ancient northern and western Hindu kingdoms, and of the [[Gupta Empire]], according to Ghurye. After the 7th-century, Skanda's importance diminished while his brother Ganesha's importance rose in the west and north, while in the south the legends of Murugan continued to grow.&lt;ref name=ghurye152&gt;{{cite book|author=Govind Sadashiv Ghurye|title=Indian Acculturation: Agastya and Skanda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HLMtAAAAMAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Popular Prakashan|pages=152–167|access-date=19 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105231228/https://books.google.com/books?id=HLMtAAAAMAAJ|archive-date=5 January 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

In the Tamil legends he has two consorts, Devayanai (identified with Devasena) and [[Valli]].{{sfn|Dalal|2010}}{{sfn|Varadara|1993|pp=113-114}} Many of the major events in Murugan's life take place during his youth, and legends surrounding his birth are popular in Tamil Nadu.

==== Sri Lanka ====
In Sri Lanka Muruga is worshipped by Sri Lankan Tamils as Murugan and also by the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] as [[Kataragama deviyo]] , a guardian deity of [[Sri Lanka]]. Numerous temples exist throughout the island. He is a favourite deity of the common folk everywhere and it is said he never hesitates to come to the aid of a devotee when called upon. In the deeply Sinhalese south of Sri Lanka, he is worshipped at the [[Kataragama temple]], where he is known as Kathiravel or Kataragama deviyo. Local legend holds that Murugan alighted in Kataragama and was smitten by Valli, one of the local girls. After a courtship, they were married. This event is taken to signify that Murugan is accessible to all who worship and love him, regardless of their birth or heritage. The [[Nallur Kandaswamy temple]], the [[Maviddapuram Kandaswamy Temple]] and the Sella Channithy Temple near Valvettiturai are the three foremost Murugan temples in [[Jaffna]]. The Chitravelayutha temple in Verukal on the border between Trincomalee and Batticaloa is also noteworthy as is the Mandur Kandaswamy temple in Batticaloa. The late medieval-era temple of the tooth in [[Kandy]], dedicated to the tooth relic of the Buddha, has a Kataragama deiyo shrine adjacent to it dedicated to the veneration of Skanda in the Sinhalese tradition. Almost all Buddhist temples house a shrine room for Kataragama deviyo reflecting the significance of Murugan in Sinhala Buddhism.

[[File:Nallur Kandasamy front entrance.jpg|thumb|The Sri Lankan [[Nallur Kandaswamy temple]] (Jaffna) is dedicated to Murugan.]]
By the 16th century, the Kataragama temple had become synonymous with the worship of Skanda-Kumara who was a guardian deity of Sinhala Buddhism.&lt;ref name=P&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pathmanathan|first=S|author-link=S.

The popularity of the deity at the Kataragama temple was also recorded by the Pali chronicles of Thailand such as Jinkalmali in the 16th century. There are a number of legends both Buddhist and Hindu that attribute supernatural events to this very locality.&lt;ref name=P/&gt; Scholars such as Paul Younger and [[Heinz Bechert]] speculate that the rituals practiced by the native priests of Kataragama temple indicate Vedda ideals of propitiation. Hence, they believe that the area was important in Vedda culture and was later taken over by Buddhists and Hindus in the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bechert|first=Heinz|author-link=Heinz Bechert|year=1970|title=Skandakumara and Kataragama: An Aspect of the Relation of Hinduism and Buddhism in Sri Lanka|journal=Proceedings of the Third International Tamil Conference Seminar|publisher=International Association of Tamil Research|location=Paris|url=http://kataragama.org/research/bechert.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925212357/http://kataragama.org/research/bechert.htm|archive-date=25 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pashupati''' ([[Sanskrit]] ''Paśupati''; [[devanagari]] पशुपति ) is a Hindu deity and an [[Avatar#Avatars of Shiva|incarnation]] of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Hindu god]] [[Shiva]] as "lord of the animals". Pashupati is mainly worshipped in Nepal and India. Pashupati is also the national deity of Nepal.

== Etymology ==
''Paśupati'' or ''Pashupatinath'', means "Lord of all animals". It was originally it is also was the epithet of [[Rudra]] in the [[Vedic period]].&lt;ref&gt;Kramrisch, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is one of the epithets of Shiva also.{{sfn |Śarmā |1996 |p=291}}

==History==
[[File:Shiva Pashupati.jpg|thumb|The Pashupati seal, surrounded by animals; circa  2350-2000 BCE. It is preserved in [[National Museum, New Delhi]].]]
The earliest claimed evidence of Pashupati comes from the [[Indus Valley civilization]] (3300 BCE to 1300 BCE), where the [[Pashupati seal]] has been said to represent a proto-Shiva figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Marshall Sir John |url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.722 |title=Mohenjo Daro and the Indus Civilization Vol-i (1931) |date=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Deity ==
Pashupatinath is an [[avatar]] of [[Shiva]], one of the [[Trimurti|Hindu Trinity]].  He is the male counterpart of [[Shakti]].

The five faces of Pashupatinath represent various incarnations of Shiva; [[Sadyojata]] (also known as Barun), [[Vamadeva|Vamdeva]] (also known as Uma Maheswara), [[Tatpurusha]], [[Aghori|Aghor]] &amp; [[Ishana]]. They face West, North, East, South and Zenith respectively, representing Hinduism's five primary elements namely [[earth]], [[water]], [[air]], [[light]] and ether.&lt;ref name=shaivism&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=N4xIBNmhpXcC&amp;dq=pashupatinath&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Encyclopaedia of Saivism], Swami P. Anand, Swami Parmeshwaranand, Publisher Sarup &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|8176254274}}, {{ISBN|9788176254274}}, page 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Puranas describe these faces of Shiva as:
{{Cquote|Sadyojata, Vamdeva, Tatpurusha &amp; Aghora are the four faces,
The fifth is Ishana, unknowable even to the seers.&lt;ref name=shaivism/&gt;}}

==By country==
=== Nepal ===
{{Main|Hinduism in Nepal}}
[[File:Pashupati Nath Temple.jpg|thumb|Pashupatinath Temple, [[Nepal]]]]

Although Nepal is a secular state, its [[Hinduism in Nepal|population is predominantly Hindu]]. Pashupatinath is revered as a national deity.&lt;ref&gt;Nepal - Culture Smart!: The Essential Guide to Customs &amp; Culture, p.148, Kuperard&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pashupatinath Temple]], located at the bank of the river [[Bagmati]], is considered one of the most sacred places in Nepal. In mythology it is said that Lord Pashupatinath started living in Nepal in the form of a deer because he was enchanted by the beauty of [[Kathmandu Valley]].

=== India ===
A Pashupatinath temple is sited on the banks of the [[Shivana]] river in [[Mandsaur]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]]. It is one of the most important shrines of Mandsaur, and Lord Shiva in the form of Lord Pashupatinath is its primary deity. Its main attraction is a unique [[Lingam|Shiva Linga]] displaying eight faces of Lord Shiva. The shrine has four doors, representing the [[cardinal direction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pashupatinath Temple [http://shripashupatinath.nic.in website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530054654/http://shripashupatinath.nic.in/ |date=2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pashupata Shaivism==

[[Pashupata Shaivism]] is one of the oldest Shaivite sects that derives its name from ''Pashupati''. The sect upholds Pashupati "as the supreme deity, the lord of all souls, and the cause of all existence".&lt;ref&gt;Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide, p. 923, Roshen Dalal, Penguin UK&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganesha has been ascribed many other titles and epithets, including ''Ganapati'' (''Ganpati''), ''Vighneshvara'', and Pillaiyar. The Hindu title of respect ''[[Shri]]'' ({{lang-sa|श्री}}; [[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|śrī}}''; also spelled ''Sri'' or ''Shree'') is often added before his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=4 April 2019|title=Lord Ganesha – Symbolic description of Lord Ganesha {{!}} – Times of India|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/astrology/rituals-puja/symbolic-description-of-lord-ganesha/articleshow/68207007.cms|url-status=live|archive-url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/astrology/hindu-mythology/heres-why-every-puja-starts-with-worshiping-lord-ganesha/articleshow/70565026.cms|archive-date=7 September 2019|access-date=4 November 2020|website=[[The Times of India]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Ganesha'' is a Sanskrit compound, joining the words ''[[gana]]'' ({{IAST|gaṇa}}), meaning a 'group, multitude, or categorical system' and ''isha'' ({{IAST|īśa}}), meaning 'lord or master'.&lt;ref&gt;* Narain, A.K.

* {{Harvard citation no brackets|Apte|1965|p=395}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''gaṇa'' when associated with Ganesha is often taken to refer to the gaṇas, a troop of semi-divine beings that form part of the retinue of [[Shiva]], Ganesha's father.&lt;ref&gt;For the derivation of the name and relationship with the {{IAST|gaṇas}}, see: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Martin-Dubost|1965|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term more generally means a category, class, community, association, or corporation.{{Sfn|Apte|1965|p= 395}} Some commentators interpret the name "Lord of the {{IAST|Gaṇas}}" to mean "Lord of Hosts" or "Lord of created categories", such as the elements.&lt;ref&gt;The word gaṇa is interpreted in this metaphysical sense by Bhāskararāya in his commentary on the {{IAST|gaṇeśasahasranāma}}. See in particular commentary on verse 6 including names {{IAST|Gaṇeśvaraḥ}} and {{IAST|Gaṇakrīḍaḥ}} in: {{Harvnb|Śāstri Khiste|1991|pp=7–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ganapati'' ({{lang|sa|गणपति}}; {{IAST|gaṇapati}}), a synonym for ''Ganesha'', is a compound composed of ''{{IAST|gaṇa}}'', meaning "group", and ''{{IAST|pati}}'', meaning "ruler" or "lord".{{Sfn|Apte|1965|p= 395}} Though the earliest mention of the word ''Ganapati'' is found in [[hymn]] 2.23.1 of the 2nd-millennium BCE ''[[Rigveda]]'', it is however uncertain that the Vedic term referred specifically to Ganesha.{{Sfn|Grimes|1995|pp=17–19, 201}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_२.२३ Rigveda Mandala 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202001602/https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/%E0%A4%8B%E0%A4%97%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A6:_%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%82_%E0%A5%A8.%E0%A5%A8%E0%A5%A9|date=2 February 2017}}, Hymn 2.23.1, Wikisource, Quote: गणानां त्वा '''गणपतिं''' हवामहे कविं कवीनामुपमश्रवस्तमम् । ज्येष्ठराजं ब्रह्मणां ब्रह्मणस्पत आ नः शृण्वन्नूतिभिः सीद सादनम् ॥१॥; For translation, see {{Harvard citation no brackets|Grimes|1995|pp=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Amarakosha]]'',&lt;ref&gt;

''Vinayaka'' ({{lang|sa|विनायक}}; ''{{IAST|vināyaka}}'') or ''Binayaka'' is a common name for Ganesha that appears in the {{IAST|Purāṇa}}s and in Buddhist Tantras.&lt;ref name="Thapan"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Thapan|1997|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name is reflected in the naming of the eight famous Ganesha temples in Maharashtra known as the ''[[Ashtavinayak]]'' ({{lang-mr|अष्टविनायक}}, {{IAST|aṣṭavināyaka}}).&lt;ref&gt;For the history of the ''{{IAST|aṣṭavināyaka}}'' sites and a description of pilgrimage practices related to them, see: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Mate|1962|pp=1–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names ''Vighnesha'' ({{lang|sa|विघ्नेश}}; ''{{IAST|vighneśa}}'') and ''Vighneshvara'' ({{lang|sa|विघ्नेश्वर}}; ''{{IAST|vighneśvara}}'') (Lord of Obstacles)&lt;ref name="Vighnesha"&gt;These ideas are so common that Courtright uses them in the title of his book, ''Ganesha: Lord of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings''.  For the name ''Vighnesha'', see: {{Harvnb|Courtright|1985|pp= 156, 213}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to his primary function in Hinduism as the master and remover of obstacles (''{{IAST|vighna}}'').&lt;ref name="Krishanvii"&gt;For Krishan's views on Ganesha's dual nature see his quote: "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} has a dual nature; as Vināyaka, as a ''{{IAST|grāmadevatā}}'', he is ''{{IAST|vighnakartā}}'', and as {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} he is ''{{IAST|vighnahartā}}'', a ''{{IAST|paurāṇic devatā}}''." ({{Harvard citation no brackets|Krishan|1999|p=viii}})&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent name for Ganesha in the [[Tamil language]] is ''Pillai'' ({{lang-ta|பிள்ளை}}) or ''Pillaiyar'' ({{lang|ta|பிள்ளையார்}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Martin-Dubost|1965|p=367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A.K. Narain differentiates these terms by saying that ''pillai'' means a "child" while ''pillaiyar'' means a "noble child". He adds that the words ''pallu'', ''pella'', and ''pell'' in the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian family of languages]] signify "tooth or tusk", also "[[elephant]] tooth or tusk".&lt;ref&gt;Narain, A.K. "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}: The Idea and the Icon".{{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anita Raina Thapan notes that the [[Root (linguistics)|root word]] ''pille'' in the name ''Pillaiyar'' might have originally meant "the young of the elephant", because the [[Pali]] word ''pillaka'' means "a young elephant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Thapan|1997|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Burmese language]], Ganesha is known as ''Maha Peinne'' ({{my|မဟာပိန္နဲ}}, {{IPA-my|məhà pèiɰ̃né|pron}}), derived from [[Pali]] {{IAST|Mahā Wināyaka}} ({{my|မဟာဝိနာယက}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Myanmar-English Dictionary |year=1993 |publisher=Dunwoody Press |location=Yangon |isbn=978-1881265474 |url=http://sealang.net/burmese/dictionary.htm |access-date=20 September 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210001846/http://www.sealang.net/burmese/dictionary.htm |archive-date=10 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread name of Ganesha in [[Thailand]] is ''Phra Phikanet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Justin Thomas McDaniel|title=The Lovelorn Ghost and the Magical Monk: Practicing Buddhism in Modern Thailand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMWrAgAAQBAJ |year=2013 | publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0231153775|pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest images and mention of Ganesha names as a major deity in present-day Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|jstor=3351212|title=A Note on the Recently Discovered Gaṇeśa Image from Palembang, Sumatra|journal=Indonesia|volume=43|issue=43|pages=95–100|last1=Brown|first1=Robert L.|year=1987|doi=10.2307/3351212|hdl=1813/53865|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam date from the 7th and 8th centuries,{{Sfn|Brown|1991|pp=176, 182, Note: some scholars suggest adoption of Ganesha by the late 6th century CE, see p. 192 footnote 7}} and these mirror Indian examples of the 5th century or earlier.{{Sfn|Brown|1991|p=190}} In [[Sri Lanka]]n Singhala Buddhist areas, he is known as ''Gana deviyo'', and revered along with [[Buddha]], [[Vishnu]], [[Kartikeya|Skanda]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Clifford Holt |title=Buddha in the Crown : Avalokitesvara in the Buddhist Traditions of Sri Lanka: Avalokitesvara in the Buddhist Traditions of Sri Lanka |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aT3AMR8g1gEC|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0195362466|pages=6, 100, 180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconography ==
[[File:India ganesha.jpg|thumb|A 13th-century statue of Ganesha, [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysala]]-style, [[Karnataka]]]]

Ganesha is a popular figure in [[Indian art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Metcalf|Metcalf|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike those of some deities, representations of Ganesha show wide variations and distinct patterns changing over time.&lt;ref&gt;* {{Harvard citation no brackets|Martin-Dubost|1965}}, for a comprehensive review of iconography abundantly illustrated with pictures.
* Chapter X, "Development of the Iconography of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}", in: {{Harvnb|Krishan|1999|pp=87–100}}, for a survey of iconography with emphasis on developmental themes, well-illustrated with plates.
* {{Harvard citation no brackets|Pal|1995}}, for a richly illustrated collection of studies on specific aspects of Ganesha with a focus on art and iconography.&lt;/ref&gt; He may be portrayed standing, dancing, heroically taking action against demons, playing with his family as a boy, sitting down on an elevated seat, or engaging in a range of contemporary situations.

Ganesha images were prevalent in many parts of [[India]] by the 6th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th-century statue pictured is typical of Ganesha statuary from 900 to 1200, after Ganesha had been well-established as an independent deity with his own sect. This example features some of Ganesha's common iconographic elements. A virtually identical statue has been dated between 973 and 1200 by Paul Martin-Dubost,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Martin-Dubost|1997}}, p. 213. In the upper right corner, the statue is dated as (973–1200).&lt;/ref&gt; and another similar statue is dated c.&amp;nbsp;12th century by Pratapaditya Pal.&lt;ref&gt;Pal, p. vi. The picture on this page depicts a stone statue in the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|Los Angeles County Museum]] of Art that is dated as c. 12th century.  Pal shows an example of this form dated c. 13th century on p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; Ganesha has the head of an elephant and a big belly.  This statue has four arms, which is common in depictions of Ganesha. He holds his own broken tusk in his lower-right hand and holds a delicacy, which he samples with his trunk, in his lower-left hand. The motif of Ganesha turning his trunk sharply to his left to taste a sweet in his lower-left hand is a particularly archaic feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more primitive statue in one of the [[Ellora Caves]] with this general form has been dated to the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;See photograph 2, "Large Ganesh", in: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Pal|1995|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details of the other hands are difficult to make out on the statue shown. In the standard configuration, Ganesha typically holds an [[Parashu|axe]] or a [[Ankus|goad]] in one upper arm and a [[Pasha (Hinduism)|pasha]] ([[noose]]) in the other upper arm. In rare instances, he may be depicted with a human head.{{refn|group=note|For the human-headed form of Ganesha in:

The influence of this old constellation of iconographic elements can still be seen in contemporary representations of Ganesha. In one modern form, the only variation from these old elements is that the lower-right hand does not hold the broken tusk but is turned towards the viewer in a gesture of protection or fearlessness (Abhaya [[mudra]]).&lt;ref&gt;In:

Miniature of Nurpur school, circa 1810. Museum of Chandigarh.  For this image see: Martin-Dubost (1997), p. 64, which describes it as follows: "On a terrace leaning against a thick white bolster, {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} is seated on a bed of pink lotus petals arranged on a low seat to the back of which is fixed a parasol. The elephant-faced god, with his body entirely red, is dressed in a yellow [[dhoti]] and a yellow scarf fringed with blue. Two white mice decorated with a pretty golden necklace salute {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} by joining their tiny feet together. {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} counts on his rosary in his lower right hand; his two upper hands brandish an axe and an elephant goad; his fourth hand holds the broken left tusk."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Ganesha has been represented with the head of an elephant since the early stages of his appearance in Indian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Nagar|1992|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puranic myths provide many explanations for how he got his elephant head.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his popular forms, ''[[Heramba|Heramba-Ganapati]]'', has five elephant heads, and other less-common variations in the number of heads are known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Nagar|1992|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some texts say that Ganesha was born with an elephant head, he acquires the head later in most stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recurrent motif in these stories is that Ganesha was created by [[Parvati]] using clay to protect her and [[Shiva]] beheaded him when Ganesha came between [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]]. Shiva then replaced Ganesha's original head with that of an elephant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details of the battle and where the replacement head came from vary from source to source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another story says that Ganesha was created directly by Shiva's laughter. Because Shiva considered Ganesha too alluring, he gave him the head of an elephant and a protruding belly.&lt;ref&gt;For creation of Ganesha from Shiva's laughter and subsequent curse by Shiva, see ''Varaha Purana'' 23.17 as cited in {{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganesha's earliest name was ''Ekadanta'' (One Tusked), referring to his single whole tusk, the other being broken.{{Sfn|Getty|1936|p= 1}} Some of the earliest images of Ganesha show him holding his broken tusk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Heras|1972|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of this distinctive feature is reflected in the ''[[Mudgala Purana]]'', which states that the name of Ganesha's second [[incarnation]] is Ekadanta.&lt;ref&gt;Granoff, Phyllis. "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} as Metaphor". {{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991|pp=92–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ganesha's protruding belly appears as a distinctive attribute in his earliest statuary, which dates to the Gupta period (4th to 6th centuries).&lt;ref&gt;"Ganesha in Indian Plastic Art" and ''Passim''. {{Harvard citation no brackets|Nagar|1992|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feature is so important that according to the ''Mudgala Purana'', two different incarnations of Ganesha use names based on it: ''Lambodara'' (Pot Belly, or, literally, Hanging Belly) and ''Mahodara'' (Great Belly).&lt;ref&gt;Granoff, Phyllis. "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} as Metaphor". {{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both names are Sanskrit compounds describing his belly (IAST: ''{{IAST|udara}}'').&lt;ref&gt;For translation of ''Udara'' as "belly" see: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Apte|1965|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Brahmanda Purana'' says that Ganesha has the name Lambodara because all the universes (i.e., [[World egg|cosmic eggs]]; IAST: ''{{IAST|brahmāṇḍas}}'') of the past, present, and future are present in him.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Vahanas ===
[[File:Thajavur Ganesha.jpg|thumb|Ganesha on his [[vahana]] ''mooshika'' the rat, c. 1820]]
The earliest Ganesha images are without a [[vahana]] (mount/vehicle).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Krishan|1999|pp=47–48, 78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of [[Mudgala Purana#The eight incarnations of Ganesha|the eight incarnations of Ganesha described in the ''Mudgala Purana'']], Ganesha uses a [[mouse]] (shrew) in five of them, a lion in his incarnation as ''Vakratunda'', a peacock in his incarnation as ''Vikata'', and [[Shesha]], the divine serpent, in his incarnation as ''Vighnaraja''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Krishan|1981–1982|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Mohotkata'' uses a [[lion]], ''{{IAST|Mayūreśvara}}'' uses a peacock, ''Dhumraketu'' uses a [[horse]], and ''Gajanana'' uses a mouse, in the [[Mahotkata|four incarnations of Ganesha]] listed in the ''Ganesha Purana''. Jain depictions of Ganesha show his vahana variously as a [[mouse]], [[elephant]], [[tortoise]], ram, or [[Peafowl|peacock]].&lt;ref&gt;

Ganesha is often shown riding on or attended by a [[mouse]], [[shrew]] or [[rat]].&lt;ref&gt;* {{Harvard citation no brackets|Nagar|1992}}. Preface.
* {{Harvard citation no brackets|Martin-Dubost|1965|pp=231–244}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin-Dubost says that the rat began to appear as the principal vehicle in sculptures of Ganesha in central and western India during the 7th century; the rat was always placed close to his feet.&lt;ref&gt;See note on figure 43 in: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Martin-Dubost|1997|p=144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The mouse as a mount first appears in written sources in the ''[[Matsya Purana]]'' and later in the ''Brahmananda Purana'' and ''Ganesha Purana'', where Ganesha uses it as his vehicle in his last incarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Citations to ''Matsya Purana'' 260.54, ''Brahmananda Purana Lalitamahatmya'' XXVII, and ''[[Ganesha Purana]]'' 2.134–136 are provided by: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Martin-Dubost|1997|p=231}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ganapati Atharvashirsa]] includes a meditation verse on Ganesha that describes the mouse appearing on his flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Martin-Dubost|1997|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The names ''{{IAST|Mūṣakavāhana}}'' (mouse-mount) and ''{{IAST|Ākhuketana}}'' (rat-banner) appear in the ''[[Ganesha Sahasranama]]''.&lt;ref&gt;For {{IAST|Mūṣakavāhana}} see v. 6. For Ākhuketana see v. 67. In: ''{{IAST|Gaṇeśasahasranāmastotram: mūla evaṁ srībhāskararāyakṛta 'khadyota' vārtika sahita}}''. ({{IAST|Prācya Prakāśana: Vārāṇasī}}, 1991). Source text with a commentary by {{IAST|[[Bhaskararaya|Bhāskararāya]]}} in Sanskrit.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mouse is interpreted in several ways. According to Grimes, "Many, if not most of those who interpret {{IAST|Gaṇapati}}'s mouse, do so negatively; it symbolizes ''[[Tamas (philosophy)|{{IAST|tamoguṇa}}]]'' as well as desire".&lt;ref&gt;For a review of different interpretations, and quotation, see: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Grimes|1995|p=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, Michael Wilcockson says it symbolises those who wish to overcome desires and be less selfish.&lt;ref&gt;''A Student's Guide to AS Religious Studies for the OCR Specification,'' by Michael Wilcockson, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Krishan notes that the rat is destructive and a menace to crops.  The Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|mūṣaka}}'' (mouse) is derived from the root ''{{IAST|mūṣ}}'' (stealing, robbing).  It was essential to subdue the rat as a destructive pest, a type of ''vighna'' (impediment) that needed to be overcome.  According to this theory, showing Ganesha as master of the rat demonstrates his function as ''Vigneshvara'' (Lord of Obstacles) and gives evidence of his possible role as a folk ''grāma-devatā'' (village deity) who later rose to greater prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Krishan|1999|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin-Dubost notes a view that the rat is a symbol suggesting that Ganesha, like the rat, penetrates even the most secret places.&lt;ref&gt;* {{Harvard citation no brackets|Martin-Dubost|1965|p=231}}

== Features ==
[[File:Nepal, ganesha, xviii sec.JPG|thumb|175px|[[Heramba]]-Ganesha with consort, 18th century Nepal]]

=== Removal of obstacles ===
Ganesha is ''Vighneshvara'' (''Vighnaraja,'' [[Marathi language|Marathi]] – ''Vighnaharta)'', the Lord of Obstacles, both of a material and spiritual order.&lt;ref&gt;"Lord of Removal of Obstacles", a common name, appears in the title of Courtright's ''{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}: Lord of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings''. For equivalent Sanskrit names ''Vighneśvara'' and ''Vighnarāja'', see: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Mate|1962|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is popularly worshipped as a remover of obstacles, though traditionally he also places obstacles in the path of those who need to be checked. Hence, he is often worshipped by the people before they begin anything new.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://chopra.com/articles/ganesha-the-remover-of-obstacles | title=Ganesha: The Remover of Obstacles| date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Courtright says that Ganesha's ''dharma'' and his raison d'être is to create and remove obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Courtright|1985|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishan notes that some of Ganesha's names reflect shadings of multiple roles that have evolved over time.&lt;ref name="Krishanvii"/&gt; Dhavalikar ascribes the quick ascension of Ganesha in the Hindu pantheon, and the emergence of the {{IAST|Ganapatyas}}, to this shift in emphasis from ''{{IAST|vighnakartā}}'' (obstacle-creator) to ''{{IAST|vighnahartā}}'' (obstacle-averter).&lt;ref&gt;For Dhavilkar's views on Ganesha's shifting role, see Dhavalikar, M.K. "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}: Myth and reality" in {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both functions continue to be vital to his character.&lt;!-- , as Robert Brown explains, "even after the [[Template:IAST|{{IAST|Purāṇic Gaṇeśa}}]] is well-defined, in art [[Template:IAST|{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}]] remained predominantly important for his dual role as creator and remover of obstacles, thus having both a negative and a positive aspect". --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buddhi (Intelligence) ===
Ganesha is considered to be the Lord of letters and learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Nagar|1992|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Sanskrit, the word ''[[buddhi]]'' is an active noun that is variously translated as intelligence, wisdom, or intellect.{{Sfn|Apte|1965|p= 703}}  The concept of buddhi is closely associated with the personality of Ganesha, especially in the Puranic period, when many stories stress his cleverness and love of intelligence.  One of Ganesha's names in the ''[[Ganesha Purana]]'' and the ''[[Ganesha Sahasranama]]'' is ''Buddhipriya''.&lt;ref&gt;''Ganesha Purana'' I.46, v. 5 of the Ganesha Sahasranama section in GP-1993, Sharma edition. It appears in verse 10 of the version as given in the Bhaskararaya commentary.&lt;/ref&gt; This name also appears in a list of 21 names at the end of the ''Ganesha Sahasranama'' that Ganesha says are especially important.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma edition, GP-1993 I.46, verses 204–206. The Bailey edition uses a variant text, and where Sharma reads ''Buddhipriya'', Bailey translates ''Granter-of-lakhs.''&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''priya'' can mean "fond of", and in a marital context it can mean "lover" or "husband",&lt;ref&gt;Practical Sanskrit Dictionary By [[Arthur Anthony McDonell]]; p. 187 (''priya''); Published 2004; [[Motilal Banarsidass]] Publ; {{ISBN|8120820002}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the name may mean either "Fond of Intelligence" or "Buddhi's Husband".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Krishan|1999|pp=60–70}}p. discusses Ganesha as "Buddhi's Husband".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Om ===
[[File:Ganesha asianartmuseumsf.jpg|thumb|upright|175px|Ganesha, Chola period, early 13th century.]]
Ganesha is identified with the Hindu [[mantra]] [[Om]].  The term ''{{IAST|oṃkārasvarūpa}}'' (Om is his form), when identified with Ganesha, refers to the notion that he personifies the primal sound.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Ganapati Atharvashirsa]]'' attests to this association. Chinmayananda translates the relevant passage as follows:{{Sfn|Chinmayananda|1987|p= 127, In Chinmayananda's numbering system, this is ''upamantra'' 8.}}

{{quote|(O Lord Ganapati!) You are (the Trimurti) [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva|Mahesa]]. You are [[Indra]]. You are fire &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Agni]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and air &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Vayu|{{IAST|Vāyu}}]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. You are the sun &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Surya|{{IAST|Sūrya}}]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the moon &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Chandra]]ma&lt;nowiki&gt;].&lt;/nowiki&gt; You are [[Brahman]]. You are (the three worlds) Bhuloka [earth], Antariksha-loka [space], and [[Swarga]]loka [heaven]. You are Om. (That is to say, You are all this).}}

Some devotees see similarities between the shape of Ganesha's body in iconography and the shape of Om in the [[Devanagari|Devanāgarī]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] scripts.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of both, see: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Grimes|1995|pp=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First chakra ===
According to [[Kundalini yoga]], Ganesha resides in the first [[chakra]], called [[Muladhara]] ({{IAST|mūlādhāra}}). ''Mula'' means "original, main"; ''adhara'' means "base, foundation". The muladhara chakra is the principle on which the manifestation or outward expansion of primordial Divine Force rests.&lt;ref name="T83"&gt;Tantra Unveiled: Seducing the Forces of Matter &amp; Spirit By Rajmani Tigunait; Contributor Deborah Willoughby; Published 1999; Himalayan Institute Press; p. 83; {{ISBN|0893891584}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association is also attested to in the ''Ganapati Atharvashirsa''. Courtright translates this passage as follows: "You continually dwell in the [[sacral plexus]] at the base of the spine [{{IAST|mūlādhāra cakra}}]."&lt;ref name="courtright"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Courtright|1985|p=253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Ganesha has a permanent abode in every being at the Muladhara.{{Sfn|Chinmayananda|1987|p= 127, In Chinmayananda's numbering system this is part of ''upamantra'' 7. 'You have a permanent abode (in every being) at the place called "Muladhara"'.}} Ganesha holds, supports and guides all other chakras, thereby "governing the forces that propel the [[wheel of life]]".&lt;ref name="T83" /&gt;

''Matsya Purana'' 154.547.&lt;/ref&gt; or by Shiva&lt;ref&gt;Linga Purana&lt;/ref&gt; or created by Shiva ''and'' Parvati,&lt;ref&gt;''{{IAST|Varāha}} Purana'' 23.18–59.&lt;/ref&gt; in another he appeared mysteriously and was discovered by Shiva and Parvati&lt;ref&gt;For summary of ''Brahmavaivarta Purana, Ganesha Khanda'', 10.8–37, see: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Nagar|1992|pp=11–13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or he was born from the elephant headed goddess Malini after she drank Parvati's bath water that had been thrown in the river.&lt;ref name="Melton2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Melton|first=J.

The family includes his brother, the god of war, [[Kartikeya]], who is also called Skanda and Murugan.&lt;ref&gt;For a summary of variant names for Skanda, see: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Thapan|1997|p=300}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regional differences dictate the order of their births. In northern India, Skanda is generally said to be the elder, while in the south, Ganesha is considered the firstborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Khokar|Saraswati|2005}} p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North India|northern India]], Skanda was an important martial deity from about 500 BCE to about 600 CE, after which worship of him declined significantly. As Skanda fell, Ganesha rose. Several stories tell of sibling rivalry between the brothers&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991|p=79}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and may reflect sectarian tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Oka|1913|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganesha's marital status, the subject of considerable scholarly review, varies widely in mythological stories.&lt;ref name="lawrence_cohen"&gt;For a review, see: Cohen, Lawrence. "The Wives of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}". {{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991|pp=115–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; One pattern of myths identifies Ganesha as an unmarried ''[[Brahmacharya|brahmachari]]''.&lt;ref&gt;In:
* {{Harvnb|Getty|1936|p=33}}. "According to ancient tradition, {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} was a {{IAST|Brahmacārin}}, that is, an unmarried deity; but legend gave him two consorts, personifications of Wisdom (Buddhi) and Success (Siddhi)."
* {{Harvnb|Krishan|1999|p=63}}. "... in the ''{{IAST|smārta}}'' or orthodox traditional religious beliefs, {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} is a bachelor or ''{{IAST|brahmacārī}}''"&lt;/ref&gt; This view is common in southern India and parts of northern India.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion on celibacy of Ganesha, see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}", in: {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|pp=126–129}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another popularly-accepted mainstream pattern associates him with the concepts of ''Buddhi'' (intellect), ''Siddhi'' (spiritual power), and ''Riddhi'' (prosperity); these qualities are personified as goddesses, said to be Ganesha's wives.&lt;ref&gt;For a review of associations with Buddhi, Siddhi, Riddhi, and other figures, and the statement "In short the spouses of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} are the personifications of his powers, manifesting his functional features...", see: {{Harvnb|Krishan|1999|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also may be shown with a single consort or a nameless servant (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|daşi}}'').&lt;ref&gt;For single consort or a nameless ''{{IAST|daşi}}'' (servant), see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}", in: {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another pattern connects Ganesha with the goddess of culture and the arts, [[Sarasvati]] or {{IAST|Śarda}} (particularly in [[Maharashtra]]).&lt;ref&gt;For associations with Śarda and [[Sarasvati]] and the identification of those goddesses with one another, see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}", in: {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|pp=131–132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also associated with the goddess of luck and prosperity, [[Lakshmi]].&lt;ref&gt;For associations with Lakshmi see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}", in: {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|pp=132–135}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another pattern, mainly prevalent in the [[Bengal]] region, links Ganesha with the banana tree, [[Kala Bo]].&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the Kala Bou, see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}", in: {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|pp=124–125}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Shiva Purana]]'' says that Ganesha had begotten two sons: {{IAST|Kşema}} (safety) and {{IAST|Lābha}} (profit). In northern Indian variants of this story, the sons are often said to be {{IAST|Śubha}} (auspiciousness) and {{IAST|Lābha}}.&lt;ref&gt;For statement regarding sons, see: Cohen, Lawrence, "The Wives of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}", in: {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|p=130}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1975 [[Hindi film]] ''[[Jai Santoshi Maa]]'' shows Ganesha married to Riddhi and Siddhi and having a daughter named [[Santoshi Mata|Santoshi Ma]], the goddess of satisfaction. This story has no Puranic basis, but Anita Raina Thapan and Lawrence Cohen cite Santoshi Ma's cult as evidence of Ganesha's continuing evolution as a popular deity.&lt;ref&gt;In:

== Worship and festivals ==
[[File:Hindus in Ghana celebrating Ganesh Chaturti.jpg|thumb|[[Hinduism in Ghana|Hindus in Ghana]] celebrating [[Ganesh Chaturti]]]]

Ganesha is worshipped on many religious and secular occasions, especially at the beginning of ventures such as buying a vehicle or starting a business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Krishan|1981–1982|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; K.N Soumyaji says, "there can hardly be a [Hindu] home [in India] which does not house an idol of Ganapati.&amp;nbsp;... Ganapati, being the most popular deity in India, is worshipped by almost all castes and in all parts of the country".&lt;ref&gt;K.N. Somayaji, ''Concept of Ganesha'', p. 1 as quoted in {{Harvard citation no brackets|Krishan|1999|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devotees believe that if Ganesha is propitiated, he grants success, prosperity and protection against adversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Krishan|1999|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganesha is a non-sectarian deity. Hindus of all denominations invoke him at the beginning of prayers, important undertakings, and religious ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;For worship of Ganesha by "followers of all sects and denominations, Saivites, Vaisnavites, Buddhists, and Jainas" see {{Harvnb|Krishan|1981–1982|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dancers and musicians, particularly in southern India, begin art performances such as the [[Bharatnatyam|Bharatanatyam]] dance with a prayer to Ganesha.&lt;ref name="Nagar, Preface"/&gt; [[Mantra]]s such as ''Om Shri {{IAST|Gaṇeshāya}} Namah'' (Om, salutation to the Illustrious Ganesha) are often used. One of the most famous mantras associated with Ganesha is ''Om {{IAST|Gaṃ}} Ganapataye Namah'' (Om, {{IAST|Gaṃ}}, Salutation to the Lord of Hosts).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Grimes|1995|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devotees offer Ganesha sweets such as [[modak]]a and small sweet balls called [[laddu]]s. He is often shown carrying a bowl of sweets, called a ''{{IAST|modakapātra}}''.&lt;ref&gt;The term ''modaka'' applies to all regional varieties of cakes or sweets offered to Ganesha. {{Harvard citation no brackets|Martin-Dubost|1965|p=204}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his identification with the color red, he is often worshipped with [[red sandalwood]] paste ({{IAST|raktachandana}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Martin-Dubost|1965|p=369}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or red flowers. {{IAST|Dūrvā}} grass (''[[Cynodon dactylon]]'') and other materials are also used in his worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Martin-Dubost|1965|pp=95–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Festivals associated with Ganesh are [[Ganesha Chaturthi]] or Vināyaka chaturthī in the ''[[paksha|{{IAST|śuklapakṣa}}]]'' (the fourth day of the waxing moon) in the month of ''[[Bhadrapada]]'' (August/September) and the [[Ganesh Jayanti]] (Ganesha's birthday) celebrated on the ''cathurthī'' of the ''{{IAST|śuklapakṣa}}'' (fourth day of the waxing moon) in the month of ''[[Maagha|magha]]'' (January/February)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Thapan|1997}} p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ganesha Chaturthi===
[[File:Ganesh mimarjanam EDITED.jpg|thumb|175px|upright|Street festivities in [[Hyderabad, India]] during the festival of Ganesha Chaturthi]]

An annual festival honours Ganesha for ten days, starting on Ganesha Chaturthi, which typically falls in late August or early September.&lt;ref&gt;For the fourth waxing day in {{IAST|Māgha}} being dedicated to Ganesa ({{IAST|Gaṇeśa-caturthī}}) see: {{Harvard citation|Bhattacharyya|1956}}., "Festivals and Sacred Days", in: Bhattacharyya, volume IV, p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival begins with people bringing in clay idols of Ganesha, symbolising the god's visit. The festival culminates on the day of [[Ananta Chaturdashi]], when the idols (''[[murti]]s'') are immersed in the most convenient body of water.&lt;ref&gt;''The Experience of Hinduism: Essays on Religion in Maharashtra''; Edited By Eleanor Zelliot, Maxine Berntsen, pp. 76–94 ("The Ganesh Festival in Maharashtra: Some Observations" by Paul B. Courtright); 1988; SUNY Press; {{ISBN|088706664X}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- while the people shout "Ganapati Bappa Morya" (Ganesha come back soon next year). --&gt; Some families have a tradition of immersion on the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, or 7th day. In 1893, [[Lokmanya Tilak]] transformed this annual Ganesha festival from private family celebrations into a grand public event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Metcalf|Metcalf}}, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; He did so "to bridge the gap between the [[Brahmin]]s and the non-Brahmins and find an appropriate context in which to build a new grassroots unity between them" in his nationalistic strivings against the British in [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref&gt;In:

* {{Harvard citation|Brown|1991|p=9}}.
* {{Harvard citation no brackets|Thapan|1997|p=225}} For Tilak's role in converting the private family festivals to a public event in support of [[Indian nationalism]].&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Ganesha's wide appeal as "the god for Everyman", Tilak chose him as a rallying point for Indian protest against British rule.&lt;ref&gt;In:
* Momin, A.R., ''The Legacy of G.S. Ghurye: A Centennial Festschrift'', p. 95.
* {{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991}}, p. 9. For Ganesha's appeal as "the god for Everyman" as a motivation for Tilak.&lt;/ref&gt; Tilak was the first to install large public images of Ganesha in [[Pandal|pavilions]], and he established the practice of submerging all the public images on the tenth day.&lt;ref&gt;For Tilak as the first to use large public images in ''{{IAST|maṇḍapas}}'' (pavilions or tents) see: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Thapan|1997}}, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;
Today, Hindus across India celebrate the Ganapati festival with great fervour, though it is most popular in the state of Maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;For Ganesh Chaturthi as the most popular festival in Maharashtra, see: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Thapan|1997}}, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} in a Regional Setting". {{Harvard citation no brackets|Courtright|1985}}, p. 202–247.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival also assumes huge proportions in [[Mumbai]], [[Pune]], and in the surrounding belt of Ashtavinayaka temples.

=== Temples ===
{{further|List of Ganapati temples|Ashtavinayak}}
[[File:Morgaon.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Morgaon temple, the chief Ashtavinyak temple]]

In Hindu temples, Ganesha is depicted in various ways: as a subordinate deity (''{{IAST|pãrśva-devatã}}''); as a deity related to the principal deity (''{{IAST|parivāra-devatã}}''); or as the principal deity of the temple ({{IAST|pradhāna}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Krishan|1999}}, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; As the god of transitions, he is placed at the doorway of many Hindu temples to keep out the unworthy, which is analogous to his role as Parvati's doorkeeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991}}, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several shrines are dedicated to Ganesha himself, of which the Ashtavinayak (Sanskrit: अष्टविनायक; {{IAST|aṣṭavināyaka}}; lit. "eight Ganesha (shrines)") in Maharashtra are particularly well known. Located within a 100-kilometer radius of the city of [[Pune]], each of the eight shrines celebrates a particular form of Ganapati, complete with its own lore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Grimes|1995}}, p. 110–112&lt;/ref&gt; The eight shrines are: [[Morgaon Ganesha Temple|Morgaon]], [[Siddhivinayak Temple, Siddhatek|Siddhatek]], [[Ballaleshwar Pali|Pali]], [[Varadvinayak|Mahad]], [[Chintamani Temple, Theur|Theur]], [[Lenyadri]], [[Vigneshwara Temple, Ozar|Ozar]] and [[Ranjangaon Ganpati|Ranjangaon]].

There are many other important Ganesha temples at the following locations: [[Siddhivinayak Temple, Mumbai|Siddhivinayak temple]] in Mumbai, Ganpatipule temple at [[Ganpatipule]], Binkhambi Ganesh mandir in Kolhapur, Jai Vinayak temple in Jaigad, Ratnagiri, [[Wai, Maharashtra|Wai]] in Maharashtra; [[Chintaman Ganesh temple, Ujjain|

Prominent Ganesha temples in southern India include the following: [[Vinayaka Temple, Kanipakam|Kanipakam]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]]; the [[Rockfort Ucchi Pillayar Temple]] at [[Tiruchirapalli]], [[Arulmigu Munthi Vinayagar Temple|Puliakulam Munthi Vinayagar Temple]] at [[Coimbatore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Major Ganesha Temples around the world|url=https://tamilminutes.com/famous-vinayagar-temple-in-the-world/|date=31 August 2022|newspaper=Tamil Minutes|access-date=22 October 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Karpaka Vinayakar Temple|Karpaga Vinayagar Temple]] in [[Pillayarpatti|Pillaiyarpatti]] which is a town named after Ganesha in [[Tamil Nadu]]; [[Kottarakkara Sree Mahaganapathi Kshethram|Kottarakkara]], [[Trivandrum|Pazhavangadi]], [[Madhur Temple|Kasargod]] in [[Kerala]]; [[Hampi]], and [[Ganesha Temple, Idagunji|Idagunji]] in [[Karnataka]]; and [[Bhadrachalam]] in [[Telangana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Krishna|1985}}, p. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;

T. A. Gopinatha notes, "Every village however small has its own image of ''{{IAST|Vighneśvara}}'' (Vigneshvara) with or without a temple to house it in. At entrances of villages and forts, below ''{{IAST|pīpaḹa}}'' ([[Sacred fig]]) trees&amp;nbsp;... in a niche&amp;nbsp;... in temples of ''{{IAST|Viṣṇu}}'' (Vishnu) as well as ''{{IAST|Śiva}}'' (Shiva) and also in separate shrines specially constructed in ''{{IAST|Śiva}}'' temples&amp;nbsp;... the figure of ''{{IAST|Vighneśvara}}'' is invariably seen."&lt;ref&gt;T.A. Gopinatha; ''Elements of Hindu Iconography'', p. 47–48 as quoted in {{Harvard citation no brackets|Krishan|1999|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ganesha temples have also been built outside of India, including [[Southeast Asia]], [[Nepal]] (including the four ''Vinayaka'' shrines in the [[Kathmandu Valley]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Krishan|1999}}, p. 147–158&lt;/ref&gt; and in several western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ganapati.club.fr/anglais/tslesganesheng.html|title=Ganesha Temples worldwide|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217044207/http://ganapati.club.fr/anglais/tslesganesheng.html|archive-date=17 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rise to prominence ==

=== First appearance ===
[[File:Kabul ganesh khingle.jpg|thumb|175px|upright|The ''[[Gardez Ganesha]]'', a 7th-century marble Ganesha found in [[Gardez]], [[Afghanistan]], and once displayed at Dargah Pir Rattan Nath, [[Kabul]].&lt;ref&gt;The inscription says that this "great and beautiful image of {{IAST|Mahāvināyaka}}" was consecrated by the [[Turk Shahis|Shahi]] King Khingala. For photograph of statue and details of inscription, see: Dhavalikar, M.K., "{{IAST|Gaņeśa}}: Myth and Reality", in: {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|pp=50, 63}}. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|jstor=29755703|title=A Note on Two Gaṇeśa Statues from Afghanistan|journal=East and West|volume=21|issue=3/4|pages=331–336|last1=Dhavalikar|first1=M. K.|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 

An elephant–headed anthropomorphic figure on [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greek]] coins from the 1st century BCE has been proposed by some scholars to be "incipient Ganesha", while others have suggested Ganesha may have been an emerging deity in India and southeast Asia around the 2nd century CE based on the evidence from archaeological excavations in Mathura and outside India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|1991|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; First [[terracotta]] images of Ganesha are from 1st century CE found in Ter, Pal, Verrapuram, and Chandraketugarh. These figures are small, with an elephant head, two arms, and chubby physique. The earliest Ganesha icons in stone were carved in Mathura during Kushan times (2nd–3rd centuries CE).&lt;ref name="Kumar, Ajit 2007. pp. 89-91"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kumar |first1=Ajit|date=2007 |title=A Unique Early Historic Terracotta Ganesa Image from Pal, District Aurangabad, Maharashtra |url=https://www.academia.edu/4417003 |journal=Kala, the Journal of Indian Art History Congress, Vol XI. (2006–2007)|language=en|pages=89–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganesha appeared in his classic form as a clearly-recognizable deity with well-defined iconographic attributes in the early 4th to 5th centuries CE.{{Sfn|Brown|1991|pp=19–21, chapter by AK Narain}} Some of the earliest known Ganesha images include two images found in eastern Afghanistan. The first image was discovered in the ruins north of [[Kabul]] along with those of [[Surya]] and [[Shiva]]. It is dated to the 4th century. The second image found in [[Gardez]], the [[Gardez Ganesha]], has an inscription on Ganesha pedestal that has helped date it to the 5th century. Another Ganesha sculpture is embedded in the walls of Cave 6 of the [[Udayagiri Caves]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]]. This is dated to the 5th century. An early iconic image of Ganesha with elephant head, a bowl of sweets and a goddess sitting in his lap has been found in the ruins of the [[Bhumara Temple]] in Madhya Pradesh, and this is dated to the 5th-century [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Nagar|1992|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Brown|1991|pp=50–55, 120}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Raman Sukumar|title=The Living Elephants: Evolutionary Ecology, Behaviour, and Conservation |url=https://archive.org/details/livingelephantse00suku_0 |url-access=registration|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0198026730|pages=[https://archive.org/details/livingelephantse00suku_0/page/67 67]–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other recent discoveries, such as one from Ramgarh Hill, are also dated to the 4th or 5th century.{{Sfn|Brown|1991|pp=50–55, 120}} An independent cult with Ganesha as the primary deity was well established by about the 10th century.{{Sfn|Brown|1991|pp=19–21, chapter by AK Narain}} Narain summarises the lack of evidence about Ganesha's history before the 5th century as follows:{{Sfn|Brown|1991|pp=19–21, chapter by AK Narain}}

[[File:Ganesha at Bhumara.jpg|thumb|left|Ganesha from [[Bhumara Temple]], 5th-6th century CE.]]
{{quote|What is inscrutable is the somewhat dramatic appearance of Gaṇeśa on the historical scene. His antecedents are not clear. His wide acceptance and popularity, which transcend sectarian and territorial limits, are indeed amazing. On the one hand, there is the pious belief of the orthodox devotees in Gaṇeśa's Vedic origins and in the {{IAST|Purāṇic}} explanations contained in the confusing, but nonetheless interesting, mythology. On the other hand, there are doubts about the existence of the idea and the icon of ''this'' deity" before the fourth to fifth century A.D. ... [I]n my opinion, indeed there is no convincing evidence [in ancient Brahmanic literature] of the existence of this divinity prior to the fifth century.}}

The evidence for more ancient Ganesha, suggests Narain, may reside outside Brahmanic or Sanskritic traditions, or outside geocultural boundaries of India.{{Sfn|Brown|1991|pp=19–21, chapter by AK Narain}} Ganesha appears in [[China]] by the 6th century, states Brown,{{Sfn|Brown|1991|p=2}} and his artistic images in temple setting as "remover of obstacles" in South Asia appear by about 400 CE.{{Sfn|Brown|1991|p=8}} He is, states Bailey, recognised as goddess Parvati's son and integrated into [[Shaivism]] theology by early centuries of the common era.{{Sfn|Bailey|1995|p=ix}}

Courtright reviews various speculative theories about the early history of Ganesha, including supposed tribal traditions and animal cults, and dismisses all of them in this way:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Courtright|1985}} p. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In this search for a historical origin for Gaṇeśa, some have suggested precise locations outside the {{IAST|Brāhmaṇic}} tradition.... These historical locations are intriguing to be sure, but the fact remains that they are all speculations, variations on the Dravidian hypothesis, which argues that anything not attested to in the Vedic and Indo-European sources must have come into {{IAST|Brāhmaṇic}} religion from the Dravidian or aboriginal populations of India as part of the process that produced Hinduism out of the interactions of the Aryan and non-Aryan populations.  There is no independent evidence for an elephant cult or a totem; nor is there any archaeological data pointing to a tradition prior to what we can already see in place in the {{IAST|Purāṇic}} literature and the iconography of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}.}}

Thapan's book on the development of Ganesha devotes a chapter to speculations about the role elephants had in early India but concludes that "although by the second century CE the elephant-headed ''{{IAST|yakṣa}}'' form exists it cannot be presumed to represent {{IAST|Gaṇapati-Vināyaka}}. There is no evidence of a deity by this name having an elephant or elephant-headed form at this early stage.  {{IAST|Gaṇapati-Vināyaka}} had yet to make his debut."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Thapan|1997}}, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pashupati seal]] (c. 2300 BCE - 2000 BCE) depicts 4 animals including an elephant around a deity who is claimed by some to be [[Shiva]]. Brown notes that this seal indicates the sacredness of elephants before Vedic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory of the origin of Ganesha is that he gradually came to prominence in connection with the four [[Vinayakas]] ({{IAST|Vināyakas}}).&lt;ref&gt;In:

"Gaṇeśa's Rise to Prominence in Sanskrit Literature". {{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991}}, p. 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hindu mythology]], the {{IAST|Vināyakas}} were a group of four troublesome demons who created obstacles and difficulties&lt;ref&gt;''Aitareya Brāhmana'', I, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; but who were easily propitiated.&lt;ref&gt;Bhandarkar. [[Vaishnavism|Vaisnavism]], Saivism and other Minor Sects. p. 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt; The name Vināyaka is a common name for Ganesha both in the {{IAST|Purāṇas}} and in Buddhist Tantras.&lt;ref name="Thapan" /&gt; Krishan is one of the academics who accept this view, stating flatly of Ganesha, "He is a non-Vedic god. His origin is to be traced to the four Vināyakas, evil spirits, of the ''Mānavagŗhyasūtra'' (7th–4th century BCE) who cause various types of evil and suffering".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Krishan|1999}}, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions of elephant-headed human figures, which some identify with Ganesha, appear in [[Indian art]] and [[Indian coinage|coinage]] as early as the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of early depiction of elephant-headed figures in art, see {{Harvnb|Krishan|1981–1982|pp=287–290}} or {{Harvnb|Krishna|1985|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ellawala, the elephant-headed Ganesha as lord of the Ganas was known to the people of [[Sri Lanka]] in the early pre-Christian era.{{Sfn|Ellawala|1969| p= 159}}

The title "Leader of the group" (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|gaṇapati}}'') occurs twice in the ''[[Rig Veda]]'', but in neither case does it refer to the modern Ganesha.

* {{Harvard citation no brackets|Mate|1962|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In rejecting any claim that this passage is evidence of Ganesha in the ''Rig Veda'', Ludo Rocher says that it "clearly refers to {{IAST|Bṛhaspati}}—who is the deity of the hymn—and {{IAST|Bṛhaspati}} only".&lt;ref&gt;Rocher, Ludo. "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Rise to Prominence in Sanskrit Literature". {{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991}}, p. 69. {{IAST|Bṛhaspati}} is a variant name for Brahamanaspati.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally clearly, the second passage ([[Mandala 10|RV 10]].112.9) refers to [[Indra]],&lt;ref&gt;Rocher, Ludo.

The Sangam period Tamil poet [[Avvaiyar]] (3rd century BCE), invokes Ganesha while preparing the invitation to the three Tamil Kingdoms for giving away in marriage of Angavay and Sangavay of [[Ceylon]] in marriage to the King of [[Tirukoilur|Tirucovalur]] (pp.&amp;nbsp;57–59).&lt;ref name="Robinson1873"&gt;{{cite book |author= Edward Jewitt Robinson |title=Tamil Wisdom; Traditions Concerning Hindu Sages, and Selections from their writings |url=https://archive.org/details/tamilwisdomtradi00robiuoft |year=1873 |publisher= Wesleyan Conference Office | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two verses in texts belonging to [[Yajurveda|Black Yajurveda]], ''{{IAST|Maitrāyaṇīya Saṃhitā}}''   (2.9.1)&lt;ref&gt;The verse : "{{IAST|tát karāţāya vidmahe}} | {{IAST|hastimukhāya dhîmahi}} | {{IAST|tán no dántî pracodáyāt}}||"&lt;/ref&gt; and ''{{IAST|Taittirīya Āraṇyaka}}'' (10.1),&lt;ref&gt;The verse: " {{IAST|tát púruṣâya vidmahe vakratuṇḍāya dhîmahi}}| {{IAST|tán no dántî pracodáyāt}}||"&lt;/ref&gt; appeal to a deity as "the tusked one" ({{IAST|Dantiḥ}}), "elephant-faced" (Hastimukha), and "with a curved trunk" ({{IAST|Vakratuṇḍa}}). These names are suggestive of Ganesha, and the 14th century commentator [[Sayana]] explicitly establishes this identification.&lt;ref&gt;For text of ''{{IAST|Maitrāyaṇīya Saṃhitā}}'' 2.9.1 and ''{{IAST|Taittirīya Āraṇyaka}}'' 10.1 and identification by {{IAST|Sāyaṇa}} in his commentary on the {{IAST|āraṇyaka}}, see: Rocher, Ludo, "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}'s Rise to Prominence in Sanskrit Literature" in {{Harvnb|Brown|1991|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The description of Dantin, possessing a twisted trunk ({{IAST|vakratuṇḍa}}) and holding a corn-sheaf, a sugar cane,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rajarajan|first=R.K.K.|year=2001|title=Sugarcane Gaṇapati|url=https://www.academia.edu/2378055|journal=East and West, Rome|volume=51|issue=3/4|pages=379–84|jstor=29757520|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201041014/http://www.academia.edu/2378055/Sugarcane_Ganapati|archive-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a club,&lt;ref&gt;Taittiriya Aranyaka, X, 1, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; is so characteristic of the Puranic Ganapati that Heras says "we cannot resist to accept his full identification with this Vedic Dantin".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Heras|1972}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Krishan considers these hymns to be post-Vedic additions.&lt;ref&gt;In:

Dhavalikar says, "the references to the elephant-headed deity in the ''{{IAST|Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā}}'' have been proven to be very late interpolations, and thus are not very helpful for determining the early formation of the deity".&lt;ref&gt;

Ganesha does not appear in the [[Indian epic]] literature that is dated to the [[Vedic period]].  A late interpolation to the epic poem ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (1.1.75–79{{efn|Bombay edition}}) says that the sage [[Vyasa]] ({{IAST|Vyāsa}}) asked Ganesha to serve as his scribe to transcribe the poem as he dictated it to him. Ganesha agreed but only on the condition that Vyasa recites the poem uninterrupted, that is, without pausing. The sage agreed but found that to get any rest he needed to recite very complex passages so Ganesha would have to ask for clarifications. The story is not accepted as part of the original text by the editors of the critical edition of the ''Mahabharata'',&lt;ref&gt;Rocher, Ludo "Ganesa's Rise to Prominence in Sanskrit Literature". Brown, pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the twenty-line story is relegated to a footnote in an appendix.&lt;ref&gt;''{{IAST|Mahābhārata}}'' Vol. 1 Part 2. Critical edition, p. 884.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Ganesha acting as the scribe occurs in 37 of the 59 manuscripts consulted during the preparation of the critical edition.&lt;ref&gt;For a statement that "Fifty-nine manuscripts of the ''{{IAST|Ādiparvan}}'' were consulted for the reconstruction of the critical edition. The story of {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} acting as the scribe for writing the ''{{IAST|Mahābhārata}}'' occurs in 37 manuscripts", see: {{Harvnb|Krishan|1999|p=31, note 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ganesha's association with mental agility and learning is one reason he is shown as scribe for {{IAST|Vyāsa}}'s dictation of the ''Mahabharata'' in this interpolation.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard L. Brown dates the story to the 8th century, and [[Moriz Winternitz]] concludes that it was known as early as c. 900, but it was not added to the ''Mahabharata'' some 150 years later. Winternitz also notes that a distinctive feature in [[South India]]n manuscripts of the ''Mahabharata'' is their omission of this Ganesha legend.&lt;ref&gt;Winternitz, Moriz.

[[File:Ganesha pachayatana.jpg|thumb|A Ganesha-centric Panchayatana: Ganesha (centre) with Shiva (top left), Devi (top right), Vishnu (bottom left) and Surya (bottom right).]]
Stories about Ganesha often occur in the [[Puranas|Puranic]] corpus. Brown notes while the Puranas "defy precise chronological ordering", the more detailed narratives of Ganesha's life are in the late texts, c. 600–1300.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991}}, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Yuvraj Krishan says that the Puranic myths about the birth of Ganesha and how he acquired an elephant's head are in the later Puranas, which were composed of c. 600 onwards. He elaborates on the matter to say that references to Ganesha in the earlier Puranas, such as the Vayu and Brahmanda Puranas, are later interpolations made during the 7th to 10th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Krishan|1999}}, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his survey of Ganesha's rise to prominence in [[Sanskrit literature]], Ludo Rocher notes that:&lt;ref&gt;Rocher, Ludo. "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Rise to Prominence in Sanskrit Literature". {{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991}}, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Above all, one cannot help being struck by the fact that the numerous stories surrounding {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} concentrate on an unexpectedly limited number of incidents.  These incidents are mainly three: his birth and parenthood, his elephant head, and his single tusk.  Other incidents are touched on in the texts, but to a far lesser extent.}}

Ganesha's rise to prominence was codified in the 9th century when he was formally included as one of the five primary deities of [[Smartism]].  The 9th-century philosopher [[Adi Shankara]] popularised the "worship of the five forms" ([[Panchayatana puja]]) system among orthodox Brahmins of the Smarta tradition.&lt;ref&gt;* {{Harvard citation|Courtright|1985|p=163}} For Dating of the ''{{IAST|pañcāyatana pūjā}}'' and its connection with {{IAST|Smārta}} Brahmins.

Once Ganesha was accepted as one of the five principal deities of Hinduism, some Hindus chose Ganesha as their principal deity. They developed the [[Ganapatya]] tradition, as seen in the ''Ganesha Purana'' and the ''Mudgala Purana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Thapan|1997}}, pp. 196–197. Addresses the {{IAST|pañcāyatana}} in the {{IAST|Smārta}} tradition and the relationship of the ''Ganesha Purana'' and the ''Mudgala Purana'' to it.&lt;/ref&gt;

The date of composition for the ''Ganesha Purana'' and the ''Mudgala Purana''—and their dating relative to one another—has sparked academic debate. Both works were developed over time and contain age-layered strata. Anita Thapan reviews comment about dating and provide her own judgment. "It seems likely that the core of the Ganesha Purana appeared around the twelfth and thirteenth centuries", she says, "but was later interpolated."&lt;ref&gt;For a review of major differences of opinions between scholars on dating, see: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Thapan|1997|pp=30–33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence W. Preston considers the most reasonable date for the ''Ganesha Purana'' to be between 1100 and 1400, which coincides with the apparent age of the sacred sites mentioned by the text.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Lawrence W.,  "Subregional Religious Centers in the History of Maharashtra: The Sites Sacred to {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}", in: N.K. Wagle, ed., ''Images of Maharashtra: A Regional Profile of India''. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

R.C. Hazra suggests that the ''Mudgala Purana'' is older than the ''Ganesha Purana'', which he dates between 1100 and 1400.&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Hazra, "The {{IAST|Gaṇeśa Purāṇa}}", ''Journal of the Ganganatha Jha Research Institute'' (1951); 79–99.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Phyllis Granoff finds problems with this relative dating and concludes that the ''Mudgala Purana'' was the last of the philosophical texts concerned with Ganesha. She bases her reasoning on the fact that, among other internal evidence, the ''Mudgala Purana'' specifically mentions the ''Ganesha Purana'' as one of the four Puranas (the ''Brahma'', the ''Brahmanda'', the ''Ganesha'', and the ''Mudgala'' Puranas) which deal at length with Ganesha.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Granoff, "{{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} as Metaphor", in {{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991|pp=94–95}}, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt; While the kernel of the text must be old, it was interpolated until the 17th and 18th centuries as the worship of Ganapati became more important in certain regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Thapan|1997}}, pp. 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Another highly regarded scripture in the ''Ganapatya'' tradition, the Sanskrit ''Ganapati Atharvashirsa'', was probably composed during the 16th or 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Courtright|1985|p=252}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Grimes|1995|pp=21–22}}

The ''[[Ganesha Sahasranama]]'' is part of the Puranic literature, and is a litany of a thousand names and attributes of Ganesha. Each name in the [[sahasranama]] conveys a different meaning and symbolises a different aspect of Ganesha. Versions of the ''Ganesha Sahasranama'' are found in the ''Ganesha Purana''.{{Sfn|Bailey|1995|pp=258–269}}

{{details|Ganesha in world religions}}

Commercial and cultural contacts extended India's influence in Western and Southeast Asia. Ganesha is one of a number of Hindu deities who consequently reached foreign lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Nagar|1992}}, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganesha was particularly worshipped by traders and merchants, who went out of India for commercial ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Nagar|1992|p=174}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From approximately the 10th century onwards, new networks of exchange developed including the formation of trade guilds and a resurgence of money circulation. During this time, Ganesha became the principal deity associated with traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Thapan|1997}}, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest inscription invoking Ganesha before any other deity is associated with the merchant community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Thapan|1997}}, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindus migrated to [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and took their culture, including Ganesha, with them.{{Sfn|Getty|1936|p= 55}}  Statues of Ganesha are found throughout the region, often beside Shiva sanctuaries.  The forms of Ganesha found in the Hindu art of [[Philippines]], [[Java]], [[Bali]], and [[Borneo]] show specific regional influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Getty|1936}}, p. 55–66.&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of Hindu culture throughout Southeast Asia established Ganesha worship in modified forms in Burma, Cambodia, and Thailand. In [[Indochina]], Hinduism and [[Buddhism]] were practised side by side, and mutual influences can be seen in the iconography of Ganesha in the region.{{Sfn|Getty|1936|p= 52}}  In Thailand, Cambodia, and among the Hindu classes of the [[Cham (Asia)|Chams]] in Vietnam, Ganesha was mainly thought of as a remover of obstacles.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Brown|1991|p=182}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among the Indonesian, who predominantly profess Muslim faith, Ganesha is not worshipped, but seen as a symbol of knowledge, wisdom and education. Many Indonesian public universities feature Ganesha's likeness in their grounds and/or logo. [[Blitar]], [[Salatiga]] City, and [[Kediri Regency]] are among 3 local governments that include Ganesha in their Regency/City official seals. Indonesia is the only country who featured Ganesha on her bill ([[Banknotes_of_the_rupiah#Updates to high denominations, introduction of the Rp100,000 note (1998-1999)|20 thousand denomination]], between 1998 and 2008), although it is no longer in circulation. 

Today in Buddhist Thailand, Ganesha is regarded as a remover of obstacles, the god of success.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; Thailand regards Ganesha mainly as the god of arts and academics. The belief was initiated by King [[Vajiravudh]] of [[Chakri Dynasty]] who was devoted to Ganesha personally. He even built a Ganesha shrine at his personal palace, [[Sanam Chandra Palace]] in [[Nakhon Pathom Province]] where he focused on his academic and literature works. His personal belief regarding Ganesha as the god of arts  formally became prominent following the establishment of the [[Fine Arts Department (Thailand)|Fine Arts Department]] where he took Ganesha as the seal. Today, Ganesha is depicted both in the seal of the Fine Arts Department, and Thailand's first prominent fine arts academy; the [[Silpakorn University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=วัฒนะมหาตม์ |first=กิตติ |date=November 2011 |title= พระคเณศไม่ใช่เทพศิลปะ รัชกาลที่ 6 ทรงทำให้เป็นเทพศิลปะ|trans-title= Ganesh was not the god of art.

Before the arrival of [[Islam]], Afghanistan had close cultural ties with India, and the adoration of both Hindu and Buddhist deities was practised. Examples of sculptures from the 5th to the 7th centuries have survived, suggesting that the worship of Ganesha was then in vogue in the region.&lt;ref&gt;In:

Ganesha appears in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, not only in the form of the Buddhist god {{IAST|Vināyaka}}, but also as a Hindu demon form with the same name.{{Sfn|Getty|1936|pp= 37–45}}  His image appears in Buddhist sculptures during the late Gupta period.{{Sfn|Getty|1936|p= 37}}  As the Buddhist god {{IAST|Vināyaka}}, he is often shown dancing.  This form, called {{IAST|Nṛtta}} Ganapati, was popular in northern India, later adopted in Nepal, and then in Tibet.{{Sfn|Getty|1936|p= 38}}  In Nepal, the Hindu form of Ganesha, known as [[Heramba]], is popular; he has five heads and rides a lion.{{Sfn|Getty|1936|p= 40}} Tibetan representations of Ganesha show ambivalent views of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Nagar|1992}}, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; A Tibetan rendering of Ganapati is ''tshogs bdag''.&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex (2006).

In [[North China|northern China]], the earliest known stone statue of Ganesha carries an inscription dated to 531.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Martin-Dubost|1997}}, p.  311.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, where Ganesha is known as [[Kangiten]], the Ganesha cult was first mentioned in 806.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Martin-Dubost|1997}}, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The canonical literature of [[Jainism]] does not mention the worship of Ganesha.&lt;ref name="Krishan"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Krishan|1999}}, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ganesha is worshipped by some [[Jainism|Jains]], for whom he appears to have taken over certain functions of the god of wealth, [[Kubera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Thapan|1997}}, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Jain ties with the trading community support the idea that Jainism took up Ganesha worship as a result of commercial connections and influence of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Thapan|1997}}, p. 151, 158, 162, 164, 253.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known Jain Ganesha statue dates to about the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Krishna|1985}}, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; A 15th-century Jain text lists procedures for the installation of its images.&lt;ref name="Krishan"/&gt; Images of Ganesha appear in some Jain temples of Rajasthan and Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Thapan|1997}}, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=April 2015}}
[[File:Martanda (An aspect of the Sun-God or Surya), Gahadavala, Rajasthan, 12th century CE.jpg|thumb|Martanda (an aspect of the Sun-God or [[Surya]]), [[Gahadavala dynasty]], Rajasthan, 12th century CE]]
'''Martanda''' ({{lang-sa|मार्तंड|Mārtanda}}) in [[Hinduism]] is the eighth and last of the Vedic solar deities called [[Adityas]]. He is known as an Aditya by virtue of being born to [[Aditi]].&lt;ref name="Nehra"&gt;{{cite book|author=Air Marshal RK Nehra|title=Hinduism &amp; Its Military Ethos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nD5dpTyYdYoC&amp;pg=PT159|publisher=Lancer Publishers LLC|isbn=978-1-935501-47-3|pages=159–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Mârtânda is etymologically derived from ''mârta'', meaning “dead or undeveloped” (a word connected with ''mrita'', the past participle of ''mri'', "to die") and ''ânda'', "an egg or a bird". The name denotes a dead sun, or a sun that has sunk below the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;Arctic Home in the Vedas, B G Tilak&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mentions==
[[File:Martand Sun Temple Central shrine (6133772365).jpg|thumb|[[Martand Sun Temple|Martand Sun temple]], built in 8th-century CE in [[Anantnag]], [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]] is dedicated to Mārtanda.]]
Book 10, Hymn 72 of the [[Rigveda]] has the following verse:

::''Eight are the Sons of Aditi who from her body sprang to life.''
::''With seven she went to meet the Gods she cast Martanda far away.''
::''So with her Seven Sons Aditi went forth to meet the earlier age. She brought 
::''Martanda thitherward to spring to life and die again.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rig_Veda/Mandala_10/Hymn_72|title=The Rig Veda/Mandala 10/Hymn 72 - Wikisource, the free online library|website=en.m.wikisource.org|access-date=2020-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aditi at first had only seven sons but later gave birth to an eighth son named Mārtanda. Although many hymns in the Rigveda mention him along with the other Adityas as a form of [[Surya]], as evident from the verse above, Aditi shunned him.

[[File:Sun temple martand indogreek.jpg|thumb|[[Surya]] [[Martand Sun Temple|temple]] at [[Martand]], photographed by [[John Burke (photographer)|John Burke]], 1868.]]

The ''Taittirîya Aranyaka'' reads:

::''Tat parâ Mârtândam â abharat''
::(She set aside Mârtânda for birth and death)

The Aranyaka then proceeds to give the names of the eight sons as [[Mitra]], [[Varuna]], [[Dhatri|Dhâtṛi]], [[Aryaman]], Amsha, [[Bhaga]], [[Indra]] and [[Vivasvat]]. But no further explanation is added, nor is it told which of these eight sons represented Mârtânda.&lt;ref&gt;The Taittirîya Aranyaka, I, 13, 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-Vedic period, when the number of Adityas increased to twelve, the name ''Vivasvat'' was added to the canon. Vivasvat and Martanda are often used interchangeably.

[[Martand Sun Temple|Martand Sun temple]] in [[Anantnag]], [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]] is dedicated to Mārtanda. Today the temple is in ruins and Martanda is no longer venerated there. However a temple complex nearby named Martand Tirth serves as a modern replacement.

[[File:Nejamesa horned god of India.png|thumb|Naigamesha, [[Mathura Museum]], [[Kushan Empire]], 1st-3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;"Naigamesa was a popular deity in the Kushana period and we have at least eight figures of this god from Mathura assignable to c. 1st to 3rd century A.D. (GMM., E. 1, 15.909, 15, 1001, 15. 1046, '''15. 1115''', 34.2402, 34. 2547, SML., J 626, etc)" in  {{cite book |last1=Joshi |first1=Nilakanth Purushottam |title=Mātr̥kās, Mothers in Kuṣāṇa Art |date=1986 |publisher=Kanak Publications |page=41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geYjAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''''Naigamesha''''' ({{lang-sa|नैगमेष}}, {{IAST|Naigameśa}}), also known as '''''Harinegameshi''''', is a goat-headed or deer-headed deity, associated with children. He also appears in [[Jain]] as well as [[Hindu]]  traditions, associated with the war-god [[Kartikeya]] and [[childbirth]].

==Associations==
Naigamesha is known by a variety of names: Negamesha, Nemesha, Naigameshin, Negamesi, Harinegameshi. The last is translated as "Negamesi, the general of Hari ([[Indra]])". Another interpretation says that it is derived from ''harina'' (deer) and ''mesha'' ([[sheep|ram]]).&lt;ref name="Dalal2014"/&gt;

Naigamesha is the benefactor and protector of children in Jainism. While the Greek satyr [[Pan (god)|Pan]] is depicted with the lower body of a goat, Naigamesha has a goat head; in both cultures, the goat denotes fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Geer pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt; He is worshipped to beget children.&lt;ref name="Dalal2014"/&gt;

==Jain texts==
[[File:Naigamesha looks over Mahavira's birth.jpg|thumb|Naigamesha (left) looks over Mahavira's birth; the infant Mahavira is held in his mother's arms. Folio from the ''[[Kalpa Sutra]]'' (1450–1500).]]

According to the ''[[Kalpa Sutra]]'', Naigamesha, on the orders of the king of the gods [[Indra]], transferred the embryo of the [[Tirthankar]] [[Mahavira]] from the womb of the [[Brahmin]] (priest class) woman Devananda to the [[Kshatriya]] (ruling caste) [[Trishala]], who finally delivers Mahavira. According to the [[Shvetambara]] text ''Neminanathacharita'', which recalls the life of the Tirthankar [[Neminatha]], [[Krishna]] – a cousin of Neminatha and generally venerated as Hindu deity – worships Naigamesha to beget a son from his second wife [[Satyabhama]]; a son who equals his first-born [[Pradyumna]], from his first wife [[Rukmini]]. Other texts portray Satyabhama praying to the deity.&lt;ref name="Dalal2014"/&gt;

==In Hinduism==
In Hinduism, Naigamesha is associated with [[Kartikeya]], the god of war and is frequently mentioned as Naigameya. Naigamesha is an epithet and a form of Kartikeya, where he is generally depicted goat-headed. In other instances, Naigamesha is described as the son or brother of the war god. Hindu texts like the ''[[Brahmanas]]'', the ''[[Grhyasutras|Grihya sutras]]'' and medicinal texts mention a similar deity with a [[Sheep|ram]]'s head.&lt;ref name="Dalal2014"/&gt; As a fearsome follower of Kartikeya, Naigamesha was feared and worshipped to ward off evil. Later, he evolved into the patron of childbirth.&lt;ref name="Kala1980"/&gt;

==Iconography==
Depictions of Naigamesha are rare and are generally confined to North India and the pre-third century era. They are many depictions of the deity found in the region around [[Mathura]], dating from the 1st–3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Geer p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalal2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|date=18 April 2014|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-81-8475-277-9|page=797}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Terracotta figurines of Naigamesha from 2nd century BCE to 4th century CE are also been discovered.&lt;ref name="Kala1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Satish Chandra Kala|title=Terracottas in the Allahabad Museum|year=1980|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-0-391-02234-8|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1st–3rd century depiction from Kankali Tila near Mathura (currently in [[Mathura Museum]]), Naigamesha is depicted with a goat's head and short, backward turning horns, a long beard ([[goatee]]) and "drooping" ears. Another sculpture from the 10th–13th century depicts him in the company of Hindu deities. The group of seven Hindu mother-goddesses, the [[Saptamatrika]] – who are associated with children – are surrounded by their usual companions [[Shiva]] and [[Ganesha]] as well as Naigamesha. The goat-features mirror the earlier depiction. In addition, Naigamesha is depicted with three children; one held in his left arm, another seated near his left foot and a third standing near the right leg, which conveys his association with children.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Geer pp. 172–3, xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his goat-head, Naigamesha may also be shown having a deer head and may be depicted transferring the embryo of Mahavira in narrative panels. He is also depicted as seated on a throne, flanked by children on his lap or shoulders. Female attendants or a goat-headed woman sometimes accompany the god.&lt;ref name="Dalal2014"/&gt;

'''Jayanta''' ({{lang-sa|जयन्त}}, "victory"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0413-jayakarNa.jpg Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary p. 413]&lt;/ref&gt;), is a character who appears in [[Hindu texts|Hindu literature]]. He is the son of [[Indra]], the king of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] (gods), and his wife, [[Shachi]] (Indrani).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2009-04-12 |title=Jayanta, Jayamta: 30 definitions |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/jayanta |access-date=2022-10-07 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a sister called [[Jayanti (Hinduism)|Jayanti]]. 

He appears in various Hindu scriptures, fighting in wars on behalf of the devas. Jayanta also appears in the epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' and other lore, in which he disguises himself as a crow.

==Legends==
{{Hindu mythology}}

=== Crow form ===
In the ''[[Sundara Kanda]]'' (the fifth Book of the epic ''[[Ramayana]]''), when [[Hanuman]] meets [[Sita]], she narrates an incident that happened in the forest in [[Chitrakoot, Madhya Pradesh|Chitrakuta]]. The prince of [[Ayodhya]] and an [[avatar]] of the god [[Vishnu]], [[Rama]], is exiled to the forest with his wife Sita (an avatar of Vishnu's wife, [[Lakshmi]]) and his brother, [[Lakshmana]]. A fatigued Rama was sleeping in the lap of Sita, when a crow attacked her. The crow pecks at her twice; once on her breast or between her breasts in some versions.&lt;ref name="Mani"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mani, Vettam |url=https://archive.org/details/puranicencyclopa00maniuoft |title=Puranic Encyclopaedia: A Comprehensive Dictionary With Special Reference to the Epic and Puranic Literature |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |year=1975 |isbn=0-8426-0822-2 |location=Delhi |page=[https://archive.org/details/puranicencyclopa00maniuoft/page/354 354] |authorlink=Vettam Mani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The ''[[Ramcharitmanas]]'' replaces the breast with feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://hindi.webdunia.com/religion/religion/hindu/ramcharitmanas/AranyaKand/2.htm|title=Ramcharitmanas|page=http://hindi.webdunia.com/religion/religion/hindu/ramcharitmanas/AranyaKand/2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a hurry to drive away the crow, she tries to fasten her garments, but ends up loosening them. Rama is awakened and recognises the crow, whose claws were dripping in blood, as the son of Indra. An enraged Rama, at the behest of Sita, picks a blade of grass and unleashes the divine weapon [[Brahmastra]] out of it on the crow, who flees in fear. The crow flies across the universe, but the weapon follows. Turned back by Indra, [[Brahma]], [[Shiva]], and various [[rishi]]s (sages), the crow takes refuge in Rama, and surrenders to him. The son of Indra requests pardon, but Rama says that the Brahmastra cannot be withdrawn. So, the son of Indra asks it to hit the crow's right eye, and he is left half-blind.&lt;ref name="Mani" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Goldman pp. 216&amp;ndash;218&lt;/ref&gt; While Jayanta is not explicitly named in the episode, various commentaries on the epic like the ''Tilaka'' and the ''Bhushana'' by Govindaraja identify Jayanta as the "son of Indra"; some other commentaries do not identify any individual son of Indra. Govindaraja remarks only Jayanta is known as the son of Indra.&lt;ref name="goldman"&gt;Goldman p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the ''Ramayana'', Jayanta is said to have assumed the form of the crow in some versions of the [[Samudra manthan|Samudra Manthana]] episode. A pot of ''[[amrita]]'' (elixir of life) emerged from the churning of the ocean by the devas and the [[Asura|asuras]]. The asuras seized the pot, but Jayanta took it from them in the guise of a crow. Pursued by the asuras, he is regarded to have flown for twelve days without rest. He stopped at four locations on earth: [[Allahabad|Prayaga (in modern Allahabad)]], [[Haridwar]], [[Ujjain]], and [[Nashik]], where the [[Kumbha Mela]] is celebrated every twelve years in remembrance of the incident.&lt;ref name="goldman" /&gt;

=== Deva warrior ===
The ''Uttara Kanda'', the final book of the ''Ramayana,'' describes a battle between Indra and the [[rakshasa]] king [[Ravana]]. While Indra battles Ravana, Jayanta fights with Ravana's son, [[Meghanada]]. A fierce battle ensues between Jayanta and Meghanada; ultimately Ravana's son strikes Jayanta, who falls unconscious. In the confusion, [[Puloman]], his maternal grandfather, takes Jayanta away from the battlefield, unseen by anyone and hides him in the ocean. Indra presumes Jayanta dead, and fights more powerfully, but Meghanada defeats him too.&lt;ref name="Mani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VālmīkiVenkatesananda1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Swami Venkatesananda|title=The Concise Ramayana of Valmiki|year=1988|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-88706-862-1|page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jayanta is also described to fight in the battle between the devas and [[asura]]s in the ''[[Padma Purana]]''.&lt;ref name="goldman" /&gt; 

The ''[[Harivamsa]]'' mentions a battle between Indra and the god [[Krishna]] to acquire the celestial tree, ''Pārijātapuṣpa'', from Indra's realm. Jayanta is described battling Krishna's son [[Pradyumna]], and is defeated. 

In the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'', Jayanta is defeated by the asura [[Surapadman]], who is finally killed by the commander-in-chief of the devas, [[Murugan|Skanda]].&lt;ref name="Mani" /&gt;

=== Bamboo curse ===
The ''[[Vayu Purana]]'' narrates a tale wherein Jayanta is cursed and turned into a [[bamboo]]. This tale is also told in context of [[devadasi]] lore, with some variations. Once, the sage [[Agastya]] arrived in Indra's court, and was welcomed by Indra, organising a dance performance of the [[apsara]] [[Urvashi]]. In the performance, Urvashi and Jayanta looked into each other's eyes in love. The distracted Urvashi missed a beat, and the dance went haywire. An agitated Agastya cursed Urvashi to be born on earth as a devadasi, and Jayanta to become a bamboo tree in the [[Vindhya]] mountains. The duo bowed in reverence, and prayed for mercy. The sage said that the curse would end when Urvashi is presented with a ''talaikole'' (a bamboo staff, Jayanta) on her dance debut (''[[Arangetram (dance)|Arangetram]]''). As ordained, the lovers were released from the curse and returned to Svarga, where Urvashi got united with Jayanta as the bamboo staff.&lt;ref name="Mani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Devi1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ragini Devi|title=Dance Dialects of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRz5ykKRVAEC&amp;pg=PA45|year=1990|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0674-0|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lakshmana''' ({{lang-sa|लक्ष्मण|lit=the fortunate one|translit=Lakṣmaṇa}}), also spelled as '''Laxmana''', is the younger brother of [[Rama]] and his loyalist in the [[Hindu epic]] ''[[Ramayana]]''. He bears the epithets of '''Saumitra''' ({{Lang-sa|सौमित्र|lit=son of Sumitra|translit=Saumitra}}) and '''Ramanuja''' ({{Lang-sa|रामानुज|lit=younger brother of Rama|translit=Rāmānuja}}). He is the twin of [[Shatrughna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2012-06-29 |title=Lakshmana, Lakṣmaṇa, Lakṣmaṇā: 34 definitions |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/lakshmana |access-date=2022-12-23 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend ==

=== Birth and marriage ===
[[File: Four Sons of Dasaratha.jpg|thumb|250px|Birth of the four sons of Dasharatha]]

King [[Dasharath|Dasharatha]] of [[Ayodhya]] had three wives: [[Kausalya]], [[Kaikeyi]], and [[Sumitra]]. He performed a [[yajna|sacrifice]] to beget sons and as a result, his queens became pregnant. Lakshmana and his brother [[Shatrughna]] were born to Sumitra, while [[Rama]] and [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] were born to Kausalya and Kaikeyi.&lt;ref name="Mani"&gt;{{cite book|author = Mani, Vettam|title = Puranic Encyclopaedia: A Comprehensive Dictionary With Special Reference to the Epic and Puranic Literature|url = https://archive.org/details/puranicencyclopa00maniuoft|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass|year = 1975|location = Delhi|isbn = 978-0-8426-0822-0|author-link =Vettam Mani|pages=[https://archive.org/details/puranicencyclopa00maniuoft/page/448 448]-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Puranas]], Lakshmana is described as an incarnation of [[Shesha]], the multiple-headed [[nāga|naga]] (serpent) upon whom rests the preserver deity [[Vishnu]], whose [[avatar]] Rama is considered to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=aravamudan |first=krishnan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJe9BAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=lakshmana+adishesha&amp;pg=PA294 |title=Pure Gems of Ramayanam |date=2014-09-22 |publisher=PartridgeIndia |isbn=978-1-4828-3720-9 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When sage [[Vishwamitra|Vishvamitra]] asked Rama to kill the demons in the forest, Lakshmana accompanied them and went to [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]] with them. Lakshmana was especially attached to Rama. When Rama married [[Sita]], Lakshmana married Sita's younger sister, [[Urmila]]. They had two sons: [[Angada (Lakshmana's son)|Angada]] and [[Chandraketu]].

Later, when Rama was exiled for fourteen years on the insistence of Kaikeyi, Lakshmana left his wife Urmila and joined Rama and Sita in exile.&lt;ref name="Mani"/&gt;

=== Rama's exile ===
Lakshmana served Rama and Sita reverently during the exile. In Panchavati, Lakshmana also built a hut for Rama and Sita to live in. Lakshmana cut off [[Ravana]]'s sister [[Surpanakha]]'s nose in anger when she tried to seduce Rama and insulted Sita. He played an important role in the war with [[Ravana]] and slew Ravana's sons [[Indrajit|Indrajita]] and [[Atikaya]].

When Sita asked Rama to fetch a magical golden hind for her, Rama asked Lakshmana to stand guard as he sensed danger and evil. The golden hind was in fact the demon [[Maricha]], who distracted Rama. When Rama killed Maricha, he cried out in his own voice for help. Although Lakshmana knew that Rama was invincible and beyond any danger, Sita panicked and frantically ordered Lakshmana to go to Rama's aid immediately. Unable to disobey Sita, Lakshmana drew a perimeter line ([[Lakshmana Rekha]] or Lakshmana's line), which Sita must not cross and went in search of Rama. Sita, however, out of compulsion of religious duty and compassion for Ravana, who was disguised as a poor [[Brahmin]], crossed the line to give him alms, following which she was abducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pauwels |first=Heidi R. M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BSRXu4pcyCsC&amp;dq=lakshmana+rekha&amp;pg=PA396 |title=The Goddess as Role Model: Sita and Radha in Scripture and on Screen |date=2008-10-09 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-970857-4 |pages=396 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war between [[Rama]] and [[Ravana]], Lakshmana killed [[Indrajit|Indrajita]] and [[Atikaya]], who were the sons of Ravana. Before he killed Indrajita, Lakhshmana was wounded daceitfully by [[Indrajit|Indrajita]], and [[Hanuman]]'s intervention saved him from certain death.&lt;ref name="Ramayana"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Wzg6wFJ5xwC | title=Ramayana | publisher=University of California Press | author=B. A van Nooten William | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-520-22703-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== After exile ===
After the end of the Lanka war, Rama was crowned King of Kosala, and Bharata became the crown prince. Rama had offered to make Lakshmana the crown prince, but he refused, saying Bharata was elder to him and more deserving of the title. Rama, hearing this, was very pleased and said "O Lakshmana, in this birth, you served me so well and did your duties as a younger brother, so I will do the same in my next birth as your younger brother". Thus, in the next birth, Rama became Krishna and Lakshmana became Balarama, Krishna's elder brother. {{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Lakshmana was the one who left Sita in the forests near sage [[Valmiki]]'s ashram after she expressed her desire to leave the kingdom. Lakshmana remained loyal to his brother and fought against Rama's sons [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]] later on. {{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

According to the Uttara Kanda, Lakshmana had ruled over Karupada; which was inherited by his elder son, Angada; whilst Lakshmana's younger son, Chandraketu had inherited [[Malla (tribe)|Mallya]], with its capital Chandrakanti being commissioned by Rama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ancientvoice.wikidot.com/src-vrm:ram7-115 | title=Ram7 115 - AncientVoice }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renunciation of life===
Sage [[Durvasa]] appeared at Rama's doorstep, and seeing Lakshmana guarding the door, demanded an audience with Rama. At the time, Rama was having a private conversation with [[Yama]]. Before the conversation began, Yama gave Rama strict instructions that their dialogue was to remain confidential, and anyone who entered the room was to be relieved of their life. Rama agreed and entrusted Lakshmana with the duty of guarding his door. When Durvasa made his demand, Lakshmana politely refused. The sage grew angry and threatened to curse all of Ayodhya if Lakshmana did not immediately inform Rama of his arrival. Lakshmana, in a dilemma, decided it would be better that he alone die to save all of Ayodhya from falling under Durvasa's curse and so interrupted Rama's meeting to inform him of the sage's arrival. Durvasa cursed him that he should go to heaven alive. Rama quickly concluded his meeting with Yama and received the sage with due courtesy. In order to fulfil his brother's promise, Lakshmana went to the banks of the river [[Sarayu River (Ayodhya)|Sarayu]], resolved on giving up the world by drowning himself in the Sarayu. From there, Indra removed Lakshmana from the water and took him alive to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-04-02|title=When Sri Rama gives death penalty to Laxman|url=https://english.newstracklive.com/news/ram-and-laxman-katha-in-hindi-ramayan-ram-laxman-and-parshuram-story-sc93-nu612-1081526-1.html|access-date=2020-06-17|website=News Track|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[File: Rama, Lakshman and Sita at the Kalaram Temple, Nashik..jpg|thumb|Rama is often worshiped with Lakshmana (left) and Sita on his sides; [[Kalaram Temple]], [[Nashik]].]]Lakshmana was depicted by the [[Ramayana]] as a man with unwavering loyalty, love and commitment to his elder brother, through times of joy and adversity alike.

[[Bandhavgarh Fort]] at [[Madhya Pradesh]] (''bandhav'' as brother, ''garh'' as fort) was said to have been given by Rama to his brother Lakshmana to keep watch on [[Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Padmanabhan|first=Geeta|date=2018-02-14|title=Holding fort at Bandhavgarh Wildlife Sanctuary|language=en-IN|work=The Hindu|url=https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/holding-fort-at-bandhavgarh-wildlife-sanctuary/article22752398.ece|access-date=2 July 2020|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military officers given the rank equivalent of [[admiral]]s in navies in the Malay Archipelago, including Malaysia and Indonesia, are titled "Lakshmana" ([[Jawi script]]: {{lang|ms|لقسامان}}) after the figure.

==Jainism==
{{main|Rama in Jainism|Śalākāpuruṣa}}

Lakshmana is referred to as Vasudeva in the Jain Ramayana. According to the Jain Ramayana, it was Lakshmana who killed [[Ravana]], not [[Rama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2015-11-10|title=No exaggerations: The truth behind what happened in the Ramayana|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/no-exaggerations-the-truth-behind-what-happened-in-the-ramayana/|access-date=2020-07-02|website=The Indian Express|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The [[Puranas|Puranic period]] from the 4th to the 12th century CE saw the rise of post-[[Vedic period|Vedic]] religion and the evolution of what R. C. Majumdar calls "synthetic Hinduism".&lt;ref&gt;For dating of Puranic period as c. CE 300–1200 and quotation, see: Majumdar, R. C. "Evolution of Religio-Philosophic Culture in India", in: Radhakrishnan (CHI, 1956), volume 4, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

This period had no homogeneity, and included orthodox [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] in the form of remnants of older Vedic faith traditions, along with different sectarian religions, notably [[Shaivism]], [[Vaishnavism]], and [[Shaktism]] that were within the orthodox fold yet still formed distinct entities.&lt;ref&gt;For characterization as non-homogeneous and including multiple traditions, see: Majumdar, R. C. "Evolution of Religio-Philosophic Culture in India", in: Radhakrishnan (CHI, 1956), volume 4, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the important traits of this period is a spirit of harmony between orthodox and sectarian forms.&lt;ref&gt;For harmony between orthodox and sectarian groups, see: Majumdar, R. C. "Evolution of Religio-Philosophic Culture in India", in: Radhakrishnan (CHI, 1956), volume 4, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this spirit of reconciliation, [[R. C. Majumdar]] says that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Its most notable expression is to be found in the theological conception of the {{IAST|Trimūrti}}, i.e., the manifestation of the supreme God in three forms of {{IAST|Brahmā}}, {{IAST|Viṣṇu}}, and {{IAST|Śiva}}... But the attempt cannot be regarded as a great success, for {{IAST|Brahmā}} never gained an ascendancy comparable to that of {{IAST|Śiva}} or {{IAST|Viṣṇu}}, and the different sects often conceived the {{IAST|Trimūrti}} as really the three manifestations of their own sectarian god, whom they regarded as [[Brahman]] or Absolute.&lt;ref&gt;For quotation see: see: Majumdar, R. C. "Evolution of Religio-Philosophic Culture in India", in: Radhakrishnan (CHI, 1956), volume 4, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The identification of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva as one being is strongly emphasized in the ''{{IAST|Kūrma}} Purāṇa'', wherein 1.6 [[Brahman]] is worshipped as Trimurti; 1.9 especially inculcates the unity of the three gods, and 1.26 relates to the same theme.&lt;ref&gt;For references to {{IAST|Kūrma}} Purana see: Winternitz, volume 1, p. 573, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting Western interest in the idea of trinity, historian [[Arthur Llewellyn Basham|A. L. Basham]] explains the background of the Trimurti as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There must be some doubt as to whether the Hindu tradition has ever recognized Brahma as the Supreme Deity in the way that Visnu and Siva have been conceived of and worshiped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sutton |first1=Nicholas |title=Religious doctrines in the Mahābhārata |date=2000 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers |location=Delhi |isbn=81-208-1700-1 |page=182 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  The concept of Trimurti is also present in the ''[[Maitri Upanishad]]'', where the three gods are explained as three of his supreme forms.&lt;ref&gt;"Brahma, Rudra, and Vishnu are called the supreme forms of him. His portion of darkness is! Rudra. His portion of passion is Brahma. His portion of purity is Visnu"—''[[Maitri Upanishad]]'' [5.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general it can be said that the trimurti has less of a role in the Hinduism of recent centuries than in ancient India.
=== Shaivism ===
[[File:Trimurti, Cave No. 1, Elephanta Caves - 1.jpg|thumb|Trimurti as [[Sadasiva]] at the [[Elephanta Caves]]]]
[[Shaivites]] hold that, according to [[Shaiva]] [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agama]], Shiva performs five actions – creation, preservation, dissolution, grace, and illusion. Respectively, these first three actions are associated with Shiva as [[Sadyojata]] (akin to [[Brahma]]), [[Vamadeva]] (akin to [[Vishnu]]) and [[Bhairava|Aghora]] (akin to [[Rudra]]). Thus, Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra are not deities different from Shiva, but rather are forms of Shiva. As Brahma/Sadyojata, Shiva creates. As Vishnu/Vamadeva, Shiva preserves. As Rudra/Aghora, he dissolves. This stands in contrast to the idea that Shiva is the "God of destruction". Shiva is the supreme God and performs all actions, of which destruction is only but one. Ergo, the Trimurti is a form of Shiva Himself for Shaivas. Shaivites believe that Lord Shiva is the Supreme, who assumes various critical roles and assumes appropriate names and forms, and also stands transcending all these.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shaivam.org/shpdestr.htm|title=Abode of God Shiva}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent visual example of a Shaivism version of the Trimurti is the [[Elephanta Caves#Trimurti, Gangadhara and Ardhanarishvara|''Trimurti Sadashiva'' sculpture]] in the [[Elephanta Caves]] on [[Gharapuri Island]].

=== Vaishnavism ===
[[File:A statue inside the Angkor Wat in Cambodia; January 2020.jpg|left|260px|thumb|Statue of [[Vishnu]], the principal deity worshipped at [[Angkor Wat]], Cambodia]]
Despite the fact that the [[Vishnu Purana]] describes that [[Vishnu]] manifests as [[Brahma]] in order to create and as [[Rudra]] ([[Shiva]]) in order to destroy,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Flood, Gavin|author-link1=Gavin_Flood|title=An Introduction to Hinduism|date=13 July 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43878-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontohi0000floo/page/111 111]|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontohi0000floo/page/111}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vaishnavism]] generally does not acknowledge the Trimurti concept; instead, they believe in the [[avataras]] of Vishnu like [[Narasimha]], [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], etc. They also believe that Shiva and Brahma are both forms of Vishnu. For example, the [[Dvaita]] school holds Vishnu alone to be the Supreme God, with [[Shiva]] subordinate, and interprets the [[Puranas]] differently. For example, Vijayindra Tîrtha, a Dvaita scholar interprets the 18 [[purana]]s differently.

=== Shaktism ===
The Female-Centric [[Shaktism|Shaktidharma]] denomination assigns the eminent roles of the three forms (''Trimurti'') of [[Adi Parashakti|Supreme Divinity]] not to masculine gods but instead to feminine goddesses: [[Mahasaraswati|Mahasarasvati (Creatrix)]], [[Mahalaxmi|Mahalaxmi (Preservatrix)]], and [[Mahakali|Mahakali (Destructrix)]]. This feminine version of the Trimurti is called [[Tridevi|''Tridevi'' ("three goddesses")]]. The masculine gods ([[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]]) are then relegated as auxiliary agents of the supreme feminine Tridevi.
In Srimad Devi Bhagwat Purana's 1st book and 4th chapter. Devi addressed Trimurti as follows:

"I am Adi Parashakti. I am the owner of this universe. I am the Absolute Reality. I am dynamic in feminine form and static in masculine form. You have appeared to govern the universe through my energy. You are the masculine form of Absolute Reality, while I am the feminine form of that Reality. I am beyond form, beyond everything, and all the powers of God are contained within me. You must know that I am the Eternal limitless energy.

She then said: Brahma! You will be generator of the universe; the Goddess Sharada (Saraswati) is your consort, she will be recognized as the goddess of wisdom and the primeval sound. Lord Brahma, this goddess will be with you when you create the universe.

She continued: Lord Narayana (Vishnu)! You are formless, yet you take form. I assign you to be the preserver of the universe. You will take different incarnations in order to save this universe's inhabitants. Oh Narayana! You have created Lord Brahma, and Brahma will further create thirty three kinds of gods and goddesses. I am goddess Mahamaya, who has made you reappear from your mystic sleep. Your consort will be goddess Lakshmi. Lord Vishnu, this goddess will be with you when you rule/maintain the universe. When life evolves, you will take the form of Vishnu, the one who will perform the task of observing and preserving this universe.

At Last she instructed: "Oh Lord Rudra Shiv, the Great God, you are the personification of time, which is above all. You will perform the task of destroying and regenerating this universe. When you are formless, time stands still. It is due to my power that you become dynamic and are capable of bringing about the destruction and regeneration of this universe. Mahakali is myself, my full form, whereas Laxmi and Saraswati are just my clones, my partial forms but due to meditation, you will surpass all my forms. It is then that I will incarnate from your left half in my manifested form. This form will be my truest manifested form. Lord Shiva, She will perform the task of destroying evil and will be your consort.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=== Smartism ===
[[Smartism]] is a denomination of Hinduism that places emphasis on a group of five deities rather than just a single deity.&lt;ref&gt;Flood (1996), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The "worship of the five forms" ({{IAST|[[pañcāyatana pūjā]]}}) system, which was popularized by the ninth-century philosopher [[Adi Shankara|{{IAST|Śankarācārya}}]] among orthodox Brahmins of the [[Smartism|Smārta]] tradition, invokes the five deities [[Shiva]], [[Vishnu]], [[Brahma]], [[Shakti]] and [[Surya]].&lt;ref&gt;Dating for the pañcāyatana pūjā and its connection with Smārta Brahmins is from Courtright, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For worship of the five forms as central to Smarta practice see: Flood (1996), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adi Shankara|{{IAST|Śankarācārya}}]] later added [[Kartikeya]] to these five, making six total. This reformed system was promoted by {{IAST|Śankarācārya}} primarily to unite the principal deities of the [[Shanmata|six major sects]] on an equal status.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[monistic]] philosophy preached by {{IAST|Śankarācārya}} made it possible to choose one of these as a preferred principal deity and at the same time worship the other four deities as different forms of the same all-pervading [[Brahman]].

=== Saura ===
The [[Saura (Hinduism)|Saura]] sect that worships [[Surya]] as the supreme personality of the [[Deity|godhead]] and [[saguna brahman]] does not accept the Trimurti as they believe Surya is God.  Earlier forms of the Trimurti sometimes included Surya instead of Brahma, Vishnu or Shiva or as a fourth above the Trimurti, of whom the other three are manifestations; Surya is Brahma in the morning, Vishnu in the afternoon and Shiva in the evening. Surya was also a member of the original Vedic Trimurti, which included [[Varuna]] and [[Vayu]]. Some Sauras worship either Vishnu or Brahma or Shiva as manifestations of Surya, others worship the Trimurti as a manifestation of Surya, and others exclusively worship Surya alone.

According to the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'', Indra is the title borne by the king of the gods, which changes every [[Manvantara]] – a cyclic period of time in [[Hindu cosmology]].

Indra is of ancient but unclear origin. Aspects of Indra as a deity are cognate to other Indo-European gods; there are [[list of thunder gods|thunder god]]s such as [[Thor]], [[Perun]], and [[Zeus]] who share parts of his heroic mythologies, act as king of gods, and all are linked to "rain and thunder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Stuart Murray|title=Manual of Mythology: Greek and Roman, Norse, and Old German, Hindoo and Egyptian Mythology, 2nd Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7lLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA329|year=1891|publisher=C. Scribner's sons|pages=329–331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similarities between Indra of Vedic mythology and of [[Thor]] of Nordic and Germanic mythologies are significant, states [[Max Müller]]. Both Indra and Thor are storm gods, with powers over lightning and thunder, both carry a hammer or an equivalent, for both the weapon returns to their hand after they hurl it, both are associated with bulls in the earliest layer of respective texts, both use thunder as a battle-cry, both are protectors of mankind, both are described with legends about "milking the cloud-cows", both are benevolent giants, gods of strength, of life, of marriage and the healing gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Max Müller|author-link=Max Müller|title=Contributions to the Science of Mythology|url=https://archive.org/details/contributionsto01mlgoog|year=1897|publisher=Longmans Green|pages=[https://archive.org/details/contributionsto01mlgoog/page/n334 744]–749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Janda suggests that Indra has origins in the Indo-European ''*trigw-welumos'' [or rather ''*trigw-t-welumos''] "smasher of the enclosure" (of [[Vritra]], [[Vala (Vedic)|Vala]]) and ''diye-snūtyos'' "impeller of streams" (the liberated rivers, corresponding to Vedic ''apam ajas'' "agitator of the waters").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Janda, Michael |year=2000 |title=Eleusis: Das Indogermanische Erbe der Mysterien |publisher=Institut für Sprachwissenschaft der Universität Innsbruck |isbn=978-3-85124-675-9 |pages=261–262 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-dUoAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brave and heroic Innara or Inra, which sounds like Indra, is mentioned among the [[Indo-Aryan superstrate in Mitanni#Names of gods|gods]] of the [[Mitanni]], a [[Hurrians|Hurrian-speaking people]] of Hittite region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=von&amp;nbsp;Dassow, Eva |year=2008 |title=State and Society in the Late Bronze Age |publisher=University Press of Maryland |isbn=978-1-934309-14-8 |pages=77, 85–86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L5QtAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indra as a deity had a presence in northeastern [[Asia minor]], as evidenced by the inscriptions on the Boghaz-köi clay tablets dated to about 1400 BCE. This tablet mentions a treaty, but its significance is in four names it includes reverentially as ''Mi-it-ra'', ''U-ru-w-na'', ''In-da-ra'' and ''Na-sa-at-ti-ia''. These are respectively, Mitra, Varuna, Indra and Nasatya-Asvin of the Vedic pantheon as revered deities, and these are also found in Avestan pantheon but with Indra and Naonhaitya as demons. This at least suggests that Indra and his fellow deities were in vogue in South Asia and Asia minor by about mid 2nd-millennium BCE.&lt;ref name="Griswold1971p177"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rapson, Edward James |year=1955 |title=The Cambridge History of India |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=320–321 |id=GGKEY:FP2CEFT2WJH  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gYg8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indra is praised as the highest god in 250&amp;nbsp;hymns of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' – a [[Hindu]] scripture dated to have been composed sometime between 1700 and 1100&amp;nbsp;BCE. He is co-praised as the supreme in another 50&amp;nbsp;hymns, thus making him one of the most celebrated Vedic deities.&lt;ref name="Griswold1971p177"/&gt; He is also mentioned in ancient Indo-Iranian literature, but with a major inconsistency when contrasted with the Vedas. In the Vedic literature, Indra is a heroic god. In the Avestan (ancient, pre-Islamic Iranian) texts such as ''[[Vendidad|Vd.]]'' 10.9, ''[[Denkard|Dk.]]'' 9.3 and ''[[Bundahishn|Gbd]]'' 27.6-34.27, Indra – or accurately Andra&lt;ref name="Müller1897p757"&gt;{{cite book |author=Müller, Friedrich Max |year=1897 |title=Contributions to the Science of Mythology |publisher=Longmans Green |pages=[https://archive.org/details/contributionsto01mlgoog/page/n346 756]–759 |url=https://archive.org/details/contributionsto01mlgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; – is a gigantic demon who opposes truth.&lt;ref name="Colarusso329"/&gt;{{efn|In deities that are similar to Indra in the [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] and European mythologies, he is also heroic.&lt;ref name="Colarusso329"/&gt;}} In the Vedic texts, Indra kills the archenemy and demon Vritra who threatens mankind. In the Avestan texts, Vritra is not found.&lt;ref name="Müller1897p757"/&gt;

Indra is called ''vr̥tragʰná-'' (literally, "slayer of obstacles") in the Vedas, which corresponds to [[Verethragna]] of the [[Zoroastrian]] noun ''verethragna-''. According to David Anthony, the Old Indic religion probably emerged among Indo-European immigrants in the contact zone between the [[Zeravshan River]] (present-day [[Uzbekistan]]) and (present-day) Iran.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=462}} It was "a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements",{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=462}} which borrowed "distinctive religious beliefs and practices"{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} from the [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria–Margiana Culture]].{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} At least 383&amp;nbsp;non-Indo-European words were found in this culture, including the god Indra and the ritual drink [[Soma (drink)|Soma]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=454-455}} According to Anthony,
{{blockquote|Many of the qualities of Indo-Iranian god of might/victory, [[Verethraghna]], were transferred to the god Indra, who became the central deity of the developing Old Indic culture. Indra was the subject of 250&amp;nbsp;hymns, a quarter of the ''Rig Veda''. He was associated more than any other deity with ''Soma'', a stimulant drug (perhaps derived from ''Ephedra'') probably borrowed from the BMAC religion. His rise to prominence was a peculiar trait of the Old Indic speakers.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=454}}}}

In ''Rigveda'', Indra is described as strong willed, armed with a thunderbolt, riding a chariot:

In the post-Vedic period, he rides a large, four-tusked white elephant called [[Airavata]].&lt;ref name="Daniélou1991p108"/&gt; In sculpture and relief artworks in temples, he typically sits on an elephant or is near one. When he is shown to have two, he holds the Vajra and a bow.{{sfn|Masson-Oursel|Morin|1976|p=326}}

In the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' and in Shaktism traditions, Indra is stated to be same as goddess [[Shodashi]] (Tripura Sundari), and her iconography is described similar to those of Indra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alain Daniélou|title=The Myths and Gods of India: The Classic Work on Hindu Polytheism from the Princeton Bollingen Series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HMXN9h6WX0C |year=1991|publisher=Inner Traditions|isbn=978-0-89281-354-4|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indra was a prominent deity in the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic era]] of Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Griswold1971p177"/&gt; In Vedic times Indra was described in Rig Veda 6.30.4 as superior to any other god. Sayana in his commentary on Rig Veda 6.47.18 described Indra as assuming many forms, making [[Agni]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Rudra]] his illusory forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/rig-veda-english-translation/d/doc834193.html | title=Rig Veda 6.47.18 &amp;#91;English translation&amp;#93; | date=27 August 2021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a quarter of the 1,028 hymns of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' mention Indra, making him the most referred to deity.&lt;ref name="Griswold1971p177"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniélou1991p106"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alain Daniélou|title=The Myths and Gods of India: The Classic Work on Hindu Polytheism from the Princeton Bollingen Series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HMXN9h6WX0C&amp;pg=PA106 |year=1991|publisher=Inner Traditions|isbn=978-0-89281-354-4|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hymns present a complex picture of Indra, but some aspects of Indra are often repeated. Of these, the most common theme is where he as the god with thunderbolt kills the evil serpent [[Vritra]] that held back rains, and thus released rains and land nourishing rivers.&lt;ref name="Müller1903p395"/&gt; For example, the Rigvedic hymn 1.32 dedicated to Indra reads:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|
{{lang|sa|इन्द्रस्य नु वीर्याणि प्र वोचं यानि चकार प्रथमानि वज्री &lt;nowiki&gt;।&lt;/nowiki&gt;

|1. Now I shall proclaim the heroic deeds of Indra, those foremost deeds that the mace-wielder performed:
He smashed the serpent. He bored out the waters. He split the bellies of the mountains.
2. He smashed the serpent resting on the mountain—for him Tvaṣṭar had fashioned the resounding [sunlike] mace.
Like bellowing milk-cows, streaming out, the waters went straight down to the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stephanie Jamison|title=The Rigveda –– Earliest Religious Poetry of India|year=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0190633394|page=135 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1LTRDwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the myth, [[Vritra|Vṛtra]] has coiled around a mountain and has trapped all the waters, namely the [[Sapta Sindhu|Seven Rivers]]. All the gods abandon Indra out of fear of Vṛtra. Indra uses his vajra, a mace, to kill Vritra and smash open the mountains to release the waters. In some versions, he is aided by the [[Maruts]] or other deities, and sometimes cattle and the sun is also released from the mountain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Oldenberg|first=Hermann|title=Die Religion Des Veda|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=2004|pages=77|language=de|translator-last=Shrotri|translator-first=Shridhar B.|trans-title=The Religion of the Veda|orig-year=1894 (First Edition), 1916 (Second Edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one interpretation by Oldenberg, the hymns are referring to the snaking thunderstorm clouds that gather with bellowing winds (Vritra), Indra is then seen as the storm god who intervenes in these clouds with his thunderbolts, which then release the rains nourishing the parched land, crops and thus humanity.&lt;ref name="griswold180"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hervey De Witt Griswold|title=The Religion of the Ṛigveda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vhkt5K1fw2wC&amp;pg=PA177 |year=1971|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0745-7|pages=180–183 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another interpretation by Hillebrandt, Indra is a symbolic sun god ([[Surya]]) and Vritra is a symbolic winter-giant (historic mini cycles of ice age, cold) in the earliest, not the later, hymns of ''Rigveda''. The Vritra is an ice-demon of colder central Asia and northern latitudes, who holds back the water. Indra is the one who releases the water from the winter demon, an idea that later metamorphosed into his role as storm god.&lt;ref name="griswold180" /&gt; According to Griswold, this is not a completely convincing interpretation, because Indra is simultaneously a lightning god, a rain god and a river-helping god in the Vedas. Further, the Vritra demon that Indra slew is best understood as any obstruction, whether it be clouds that refuse to release rain or mountains or snow that hold back the water.&lt;ref name="griswold180" /&gt; Jamison and Brereton also state that Vritra is best understood as any obstacle. The Vritra myth is associated with the Midday Pressing of soma, which is dedicated to Indra or Indra and the Maruts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Even though Indra is declared as the king of gods in some verses, there is no consistent subordination of other gods to Indra. In Vedic thought, all gods and goddesses are equivalent and aspects of the same eternal abstract [[Brahman]], none consistently superior, none consistently inferior. All gods obey Indra, but all gods also obey Varuna, Vishnu, Rudra and others when the situation arises. Further, Indra also accepts and follows the instructions of [[Savitr]] (solar deity).&lt;ref name="Keith1925p93"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Berriedale Keith|title=The Religion and Philosophy of the Veda and Upanishads |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PaH4uKI7MaEC |year=1925 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0645-0|pages=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indra, like all Vedic deities, is a part of [[henotheism|henotheistic]] theology of ancient India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Max Müller |title=Contributions to the Science of Mythology|url=https://archive.org/details/contributionsto01mlgoog |year=1897|publisher=Longmans Green |page=[https://archive.org/details/contributionsto01mlgoog/page/n348 758]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second-most important myth about Indra is about the Vala cave. In this story, the [[List of ancient Indo-Aryan peoples and tribes#Vedic_tribes|Panis]] have stolen cattle and hidden them in the Vala cave. Here Indra utilizes the power of the songs he chants to split the cave open to release the cattle and dawn. He is accompanied in the cave by the Angirases (and sometimes Navagvas or the Daśagvas). Here Indra exemplifies his role as a priest-king, called ''bṛhaspati''. Eventually later in the Rigveda, [[Bṛhaspati]] and Indra become separate deities as both Indra and the Vedic king lose their priestly functions. The Vala myth was associated with the Morning Pressing of soma, in which cattle was donated to priests, called ''[[Dakshina|dakṣiṇā]].''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stephanie Jamison|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Rigveda_3_Volume_Set/fgzVAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0|title=The Rigveda –– Earliest Religious Poetry of India |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2015|isbn=978-0190633394|location=|pages=38–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parentage of Indra is inconsistent in Vedic texts, and in fact Rigveda 4.17.12 states that Indra himself may not even know that much about his mother and father. Some verses of Vedas suggest that his mother was a ''grishti'' (a cow), while other verses name her Nishtigri. The medieval commentator [[Sayana]] identified her with [[Aditi]], the goddess who is his mother in later Hinduism. The [[Atharvaveda]] states Indra's mother is Ekashtaka, daughter of [[Prajapati]]. Some verses of Vedic texts state that Indra's father is [[Tvastr|Tvashtr]] or sometimes the couple [[Dyaus]]h and [[Prithvi]] are mentioned as his parents.&lt;ref name=Jamison-2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Jamison |first=Stephanie W. |year=2014 |title=The Rigveda: Earliest religious poetry of India |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199370184 |pages=39, 582}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|style=ama|pages=39, 582}}&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DPr"/&gt; According to a legend found in it, before Indra is born, his mother attempts to persuade him to not take an unnatural exit from her womb.

Indra is also found in many other myths that are poorly understood. In one, Indra crushes the cart of [[Ushas]] (Dawn), and she runs away. In another Indra beats [[Surya]] in a chariot race by tearing off the wheel of his chariot. This is connected to a myth where Indra and his sidekick [[Kutsa]] ride the same chariot drawn by the horses of the wind to the house of Uśanā Kāvya to receive aid before killing [[Susna|Śuṣṇa]], the enemy of Kutsa. In one myth Indra (in some versions helped by [[Vishnu#Vedas|Viṣṇu]]) shoots a boar named Emuṣa in order to obtain special rice porridge hidden inside or behind a mountain. Another myth has Indra kill Namuci by beheading him. In later versions of that myth Indra does this through trickery involving the foam of water. Other beings slain by Indra include Śambara, Pipru, Varcin, Dhuni and Cumuri, and others. Indra's chariot is pulled by fallow bay horses described as ''hárī''. They bring Indra to and from the sacrifice, and are even offered their own roasted grains.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

====Upanishads====
The ancient ''[[Aitareya Upanishad]]'' equates Indra, along with other deities, with [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, self) in the Vedanta's spirit of internalization of rituals and gods. It begins with its cosmological theory in verse 1.1.1 by stating that, "in the beginning, Atman, verily one only, was here - no other blinking thing whatever; he bethought himself: let me now create worlds".&lt;ref name=Hume-1921&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Hume |year=1921 |section=verses&amp;nbsp;1.1.1, and 1.3.13-.3.14 |title=The Thirteen Principal Upanishads |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=294-298 with footnotes |url=https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n315/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|style=ama|page=294}}&lt;ref name="Deussen1997p15"/&gt; This soul, which the text refers to as Brahman as well, then proceeds to create the worlds and beings in those worlds wherein all Vedic gods and goddesses such as sun-god, moon-god, Agni, and other divinities become active cooperative organs of the body.&lt;ref name="Deussen1997p15"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hume-1921/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|page=295-297}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bronkhorst, Johannes |year=2007 |title=Greater Magadha: Studies in the culture of early India |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-15719-4 |page=128 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4GNG5KuH73QC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Atman thereafter creates food, and thus emerges a sustainable non-sentient universe, according to the Upanishad. The eternal Atman then enters each living being making the universe full of sentient beings, but these living beings fail to perceive their Atman.

In post-Vedic texts, Indra is depicted as an intoxicated hedonistic god, his importance declines, and he evolves into a minor deity in comparison to others in the Hindu pantheon, such as [[Shiva]], [[Vishnu]], or [[Devi]]. In Hindu texts, Indra is some times known as an aspect ([[avatar]]) of [[Shiva]].&lt;ref name="Daniélou1991p106"/&gt;

In the [[Puranas]], [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], the divine sage [[Kashyapa]] is described as the father of Indra, and [[Aditi]] as his mother. In this tradition, he is presented as one of their thirty-three sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mani|first=Vettam|title=Purāṇic Encyclopaedia: A Comprehensive Dictionary with Special Reference to the Epic and Purāṇic Literature|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1975|isbn=978-81-208-0597--2|location=|pages=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dalal|first=Roshen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;q=Indra+aditi|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|date=2010|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-341421-6 |pages=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indra married [[Shachi]], the daughter of [[Danava (Hinduism)|Danava]] [[Puloman]].

Indra had multiple affairs with other women. One such was [[Ahalya]], wife of sage Gautama. Indra was cursed by the sage. Although the Brahmanas (9th to 6th centuries BCE) are the earliest scriptures to hint at their relationship, the 7th- to 4th-century BCE Hindu epic [[Ramayana]] – whose hero is [[Rama]] – is the first to explicitly mention the affair in detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Söhnen|first=Renate|date=February 1991|title=Indra and Women|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bulletin-of-the-school-of-oriental-and-african-studies/article/indra-and-women/7F6A10EAFE97A94A433232ACF75C2712|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|language=en|volume=54|issue=1|pages=68–74|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00009617|s2cid=162225024|issn=1474-0699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indra becomes a source of nuisance rains in the Puranas, out of anger and with an intent to hurt mankind. But, [[Krishna]] as an avatar of [[Vishnu]], comes to the rescue by lifting [[Govardhan Hill|Mount Govardhana]] on his fingertip, and letting mankind shelter under the mountain till Indra exhausts his anger and relents.&lt;ref name=donigerindra&gt;Wendy Doniger (2015), [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Indra Indra: Indian deity], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to Mahabharata, Indra disguised himself as a [[Brahmin]] approached Karna and asked for his kavacha (body armor) and kundala (earrings) as charity. Although being aware of his true identity, [[Karna]] peeled off his kavacha and kundala and fulfilled the wish of Indra. Pleased by this act Indra, gifted Karna a dart called Vasavi Shakthi.

According to the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'', Indra is the position of being the king of the gods which changes in every [[Manvantara]]—a cyclic period of time in [[Hindu cosmology]]. Each [[Manvantara]] has its own Indra and the Indra of the current [[Manvantara]] is called ''Purandhara''.&lt;ref name = "Dalal2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

=== Sangam literature (300 BCE–300 CE) ===
[[Sangam literature]] of the [[Tamil language]] contains more stories about Indra by various authors. In [[Silapathikaram]] Indra is described as ''Maalai venkudai mannavan'' (மாலைவெண் குடை மன்னவன்), literally meaning Indra with the pearl-garland and white umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S Krishnamoorthy|title=Silappadikaram|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=STbMzFKaxcQC |year=2011|publisher=Bharathi Puthakalayam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sangam literature]] also describes [[Indra Vizha (festival)|Indira Vizha]] (festival for Indra), the festival for want of rain, celebrated for one full month starting from the full moon in Ootrai (later name – Cittirai) and completed on the full moon in Puyaazhi (Vaikaasi) (which coincides with Buddhapurnima). It is described in the epic [[Silappatikaram]] in detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S Krishnamoorthy|title=Silappadikaram|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=STbMzFKaxcQC |year=2011|publisher=Bharathi Puthakalayam|pages=31–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China]], [[Korea]], and [[Japan]], he is known by the characters 帝釋天 (Chinese: 釋提桓因, pinyin: shì dī huán yīn, Korean: "Je-seok-cheon" or 桓因 ''Hwan-in'', Japanese: "Tai-shaku-ten", [[kanji]]: 帝釈天) and usually appears opposite [[Brahma]] in Buddhist art. Brahma and Indra are revered together as protectors of the historical Buddha (Chinese: 釋迦, [[kanji]]: 釈迦, also known as [[Gautama Buddha|Shakyamuni]]), and are frequently shown giving the infant Buddha his first bath. Although Indra is often depicted like a [[bodhisattva]] in the Far East, typically in [[Tang dynasty]] costume, his iconography also includes a martial aspect, wielding a thunderbolt from atop his elephant mount.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In some schools of Buddhism and in Hinduism, the image of [[Indra's net]]  is a metaphor for the emptiness of all things, and at the same time a metaphor for the understanding of the universe as a web of connections and interdependences&lt;ref&gt;[[Indra's Net (book)#cite note-FOOTNOTEMalhotra20144-10]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{circular reference|date=December 2019}}.

In China, Indra (帝釋天 Dìshìtiān) is regarded as one of the twenty-four protective devas ([[:zh:二十四诸天|二十四諸天]] Èrshísì zhūtiān) of Buddhism. In Chinese Buddhist temples, his statue is usually enshrined in the [[Mahavira Hall]] along with the other devas.

In Japan, Indra (帝釈天 Taishakuten) is one of the twelve Devas, as guardian deities, who are found in or around Buddhist temples (十二天[[:ja:十二天|Jūni-ten]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Twelve heavenly deities (devas) |publisher=Nara National Museum |place=Nara, Japan |url=http://www.emuseum.jp/detail/100031/000/000?mode=detail&amp;d_lang=en |access-date=31 December 2015 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201634/http://www.emuseum.jp/detail/100031/000/000?mode=detail&amp;d_lang=en |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biswas184"&gt;{{cite book |first=S. |last=Biswas |year=2000 |title=Art of Japan |publisher=Northern |isbn=978-817211269-1 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Willem Frederik |last1=Stutterheim |display-authors=etal |year=1995 |title=Rāma-legends and Rāma-reliefs in Indonesia |isbn=978-817017251-2 |pages={{mvar|xiv–xvi}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Snodgrass, A. |author-link=Adrian Snodgrass |year=2007 |title=The Symbolism of the Stupa, Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-812080781-5 |pages=120-124, 298-300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indra in [[Jainism|Jain]] mythology always serves the [[Tirthankara]] teachers. Indra most commonly appears in stories related to Tirthankaras, in which Indra himself manages and celebrates the [[Panch Kalyanaka|five auspicious events]] in that Tirthankara's life, such as Chavan kalyanak, [[Birth|Janma]] kalyanak, [[Diksha]] kalyanak, [[Kevala Jnana]] kalyanak, and [[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]] kalyanak.{{sfn|Goswamy|2014|p=245}}

There are sixty-four Indras in Jaina literature, each ruling over different heavenly realms where heavenly souls who have not yet gained Kaivalya ([[moksha]]) are reborn according to Jainism.&lt;ref name=Wileyj99/&gt;&lt;ref name=owenj64/&gt; Among these many Indras, the ruler of the first Kalpa heaven is the Indra who is known as ''Saudharma'' in [[Digambara]], and ''Sakra'' in [[Śvētāmbara]] tradition. He is most preferred, discussed and often depicted in Jaina caves and marble temples, often with his wife Indrani.&lt;ref name=owenj64&gt;{{cite book |author=Owen, Lisa |year=2012 |title=Carving Devotion in the Jain Caves at Ellora |publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=978-90-04-20629-8 |pages=25–28, 29–33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vHK2WE8xAzYC&amp;pg=PA25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|style=ama|pages=25–28}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=von Glasenapp, Helmuth |year=1999 |title=Jainism: An Indian religion of salvation |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1376-2 |pages=268–269 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzEzXDk0v6sC}}&lt;/ref&gt; They greet the devotee as he or she walks in, flank the entrance to an idol of [[Arihant (Jainism)|Jina]] (conqueror), and lead the gods as they are shown celebrating the five auspicious moments in a Jina's life, including his birth.&lt;ref name=Wileyj99/&gt; These Indra-related stories are enacted by laypeople in Jainism tradition during special Puja (worship) or festive remembrances.&lt;ref name=Wileyj99/&gt;&lt;ref name=owenj64/&gt;{{rp|style=ama|pages=29–33}}

*from ''agri'', the root of which means "first", referring to "that first in the universe to arise" or "fire" according to ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' section 6.1.1; the Brahmana claims this is cryptically called as Agni because everyone including the gods are known to love short nicknames;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annette Wilke|author2=Oliver Moebus|title=Sound and Communication: An Aesthetic Cultural History of Sanskrit Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wmYz_OtZ_gC |year=2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-024003-0|pages=418 with footnote 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*according to the 5th-century BCE Sanskrit text ''[[Nirukta|Nirukta-Nighantu]]'' in section 7.14, sage Śakapūṇi states the word Agni is derived from three verbs – from 'going', from 'shining or burning', and from 'leading'; the letter "a" (अ) is from root "i" which he claims implies 'to go', the letter "g" (ग्) is from the root "añj" meaning 'to shine' or "dah" meaning 'to burn', and the last letter is by itself the root "nī" (नी) which means 'to lead'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nighantu and the Nirukta| author=Lakshman Sarup| year=1998| isbn=978-81-208-1381-6| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=120|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0l2UOabkPTIC&amp;pg=PA238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the three explanations cited above is plausible in the modern scientific sense.

In the early Vedic literature, Agni primarily connotes the fire as a god, one reflecting the primordial powers to consume, transform and convey.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p15"&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur Anthony |last=MacDonell |year=1898 |title=Vedic Mythology |pages=15–16, 92–93 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1113-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=William Norman Brown |author2=Rosane Rocher |year=1978 |title=India and Indology: Selected articles |pages=59–61 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BdaXdGm8h9gC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the term is also used with the meaning of a ''Mahabhuta'' (constitutive substance), one of five that the earliest Vedic thinkers believed to constitute material existence, and that later Vedic thinkers such as [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]] and [[Kapila]] expanded widely, namely Akasha (ether, space), Vayu (air), Ap (water), Prithvi (earth) and Agni (fire).&lt;ref name=agrawala28&gt;V.S.

There are many theories about the origins of the god Agni, some tracing it to Indo-European mythologies, others tracing to mythologies within the Indian tradition.&lt;ref name="Bodewitz1976p14"&gt;{{cite book |first=H.

The origin myth found in many Indo-European cultures is one of a bird, or bird like being, that carries or brings fire from the gods to mankind. Alternatively, this messenger brings an elixir of immortality from heaven to earth. In either case, the bird returns everyday with sacrificial offerings for the gods, but sometimes the bird hides or disappears without trace. Agni is molded in similar mythical themes, in some hymns with the phrase the "heavenly bird that flies".&lt;ref name=oflaherty97/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger1981p80"&gt;{{cite book |first=Wendy |last=Doniger |year=1981 |title=The Rig Veda: An Anthology: One Hundred and Eight Hymns, Selected, Translated and Annotated |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-044402-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/rigvedapenguincl00anon/page/80 80], 97 |url=https://archive.org/details/rigvedapenguincl00anon |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest layers of the Vedic texts of Hinduism, such as section 6.1 of ''Kaṭhaka Saṃhitā'' and section 1.8.1 of ''Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā'' state that the universe began with nothing, neither night nor day existed, what existed was just Prajāpati (also referred to as Brahman).&lt;ref name="Bodewitz1976p14"/&gt; Agni originated from the forehead of [[Prajapati|Prajāpati]], assert these texts. With the creation of Agni came light, and with that were created day and night. Agni, state these ''[[Saṃhitā]]''s, is the same as the [[Brahman]], the truth, the eye of the manifested universe.&lt;ref name="Bodewitz1976p14"/&gt; These mythologies develop into more complex stories about Agni's origins in the later layers of Vedic texts, such as in section 2.1.2 of the ''Taittiriya Brahmana'' and sections 2.2.3–4 of ''Shatapatha Brahmana''.&lt;ref name="Bodewitz1976p14"/&gt;

Agni is originally conceptualized as the ultimate source of the "creator-maintainer-destroyer" triad, then one of the trinities, as the one who ruled the earth. His twin brother [[Indra]] ruled the atmosphere as the god of storm, rain and war, while [[Surya|Sūrya]] ruled the sky and heavens.&lt;ref name=williams49&gt;{{cite book |first=George M. |last=Williams |year=2008 |title=Handbook of Hindu Mythology |pages=48–51 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-533261-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7LOZfwCDpEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The Vedic idea that the sun, lightning, and fire were different manifestation of the same element and principle is summarized in many Hindu texts, such as the ancient ''[[Bṛhaddevatā]]''.&lt;ref name=bettina225&gt;{{cite book |first1=Bettina |last1=Bäumer |first2=Kapila |last2=Vatsyayan |title=Kalatattvakosa: A Lexicon of Fundamental Concepts of the Indian Arts |year=1988 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1402-8 |pages=225–226 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPoIZaGGtiMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} His position and importance evolves over time, in the "creator-maintainer-destroyer" aspects of existence in Hindu thought.&lt;ref name="Daniélou1991p106"&gt;{{cite book |first=Alain |last=Daniélou |title=The Myths and Gods of India: The Classic Work on Hindu Polytheism from the Princeton Bollingen Series |year=1991 |publisher=Inner Traditions |isbn=978-0-89281-354-4 |pages=106–107 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HMXN9h6WX0C&amp;pg=PA106}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The Trimurti idea of Hinduism, states [[Jan Gonda]], "seems to have developed from ancient cosmological and ritualistic speculations about the triple character of an individual god, in the first place of '''Agni''', whose births are three or threefold, and who is threefold light, has three bodies and three stations".&lt;ref name=Gonda1969&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jan |last=Gonda |year=1969 |title=The Hindu Trinity |journal=Anthropos |volume=Bd 63/64 |issue=H 1/2 |pages=212–226 |jstor=40457085 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40457085}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp||pages=218–219}} Other trinities, beyond the more common "Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva", mentioned in ancient and medieval Hindu texts include: "Indra, Vishnu, Brahmanaspati"; "Agni, Indra, Surya"; "Agni, Vayu, Aditya"; "Mahalakshmi, Mahasarasvati, and Mahakali"; and others.&lt;ref name=Gonda1969/&gt;{{rp|pages=212–226}}&lt;ref name=davidwhite29&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=White |year=2006 |title=Kiss of the Yogini |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-89484-3 |pages=4, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Vedic pantheon, Agni occupies, after Indra, the most important position.&lt;ref name=jamison2014p40/&gt; Agni is prominent in the hymns of the [[Vedas]] and particularly the [[Brahmanas]].

The Vedas describe the parents of Agni as two kindling fire sticks, whose loving action creates him. Just born, he is poetically presented as a tender baby, who needs loving attention lest he vanishes. With care, he sparks and smokes, then flames and grows stronger than his parents, finally so strong that he devours what created him.&lt;ref name="jamison41"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stephanie W.

The hymns in these ancient texts refer to Agni with numerous epithets and synonyms, such as ''Jātavedas'' (he who knows all generations), ''Vaiśvānara'' (relating to all men), ''Tanūnapāt'' (son of himself, self-made), ''Narāśaṃsa'' (who embodies men's praise), ''Tripatsya'' (with three dwellings), and many others.&lt;ref name="jamison41"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur Anthony |last=MacDonell |year=1898 |title=Vedic Mythology |pages=71, 93–95, 99–100 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1113-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Vedic mythologies, Agni is also presented as one who is mysterious with a tendency to play hide and seek, not just with humans but with the gods. He hides in strange places such as waters where in one myth he imbues life force into living beings that dwell therein, and in another where the fishes report his presence to the gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Wendy Doniger |last=O'Flaherty |title=Hindu Myths |year=1994 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-400011-1 |pages=97–101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ajLoN2yuZbwC&amp;pg=PA97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agni is in hymn 10.124 of the ''ṚgVeda'', a [[Rishi]] (sage-poet-composer) and along with Indra and Sūrya makes up the Vedic triad of deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World Vol.1|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|page=210|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&amp;pg=PA213 |isbn=9788170223740|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agni features prominently in the major and minor Upanishads of Hinduism. Among the earliest mention is the legend of a boy named [[Satyakāma Jābāla]], of uncertain parentage from an unwed mother, in chapter 4 of the ''[[Chandogya Upanishad|Chhāndogya Upanishad]]'' (~700 BCE).

==Significance==
Vedic rituals involve Agni. He is a part of many Hindu rites-of-passage ceremonies such as celebrating a birth (lighting a lamp), prayers (aarti lamp), at weddings (the yajna where the bride and groom circle the fire seven times) and at death (cremation). According to ''[[Atharvaveda]]'', it is Agni that conveys the soul of the dead from the pyre to be reborn in the next world or life.&lt;ref name=williams49/&gt; However, this role was in post-Vedic texts subsumed in the role of god Yama.&lt;ref name=williams49/&gt; Agni has been important in temple architecture, is typically present in the southeast corner of a [[Hindu temple]].

===Rites of passage: Hindu wedding===
{{Main|Hindu wedding}}
The most important ritual of Hindu weddings is performed around Agni. It is called the ''Saptapadi'' (Sanskrit for "seven steps/feet") or Sat Phere, and it represents the legal part of Hindu marriage.&lt;ref name=bbc2009&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/ritesrituals/weddings.shtml BBC News article on Hinduism &amp; Weddings], Nawal Prinja (24 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Registrar General, Government of India (1962), v. 20, pt. 6, no. 2, Manager of Publications, Government of India, On Hindu wedding rituals&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual involves a couple completing seven actual or symbolic circuits around the ''Agni'', which is considered a witness to the vows they make to each other.{{efn|The two rake the holy vow in the presence of Agni&amp;nbsp;... In the first four rounds, the bride leads and the groom follows, and in the final three, the groom leads and the bride follows.

With each circuit, the couple makes a specific vow to establish some aspect of a happy relationship and household for each other, with Agni as the divine witness to those mutual vows.&lt;ref name="goi1962"&gt;{{cite report |title=Census of India, 1961 |year=1962 |volume=20, part&amp;nbsp;6 |number=2 |publisher=Office of the Registrar General, Government of India |department=Manager of Publications, Government of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0sbUAAAAMAAJ |quote=The bride leads in all the first six pheras but follows the bridegroom on the seventh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Central India and [[Suriname]], the bride leads the first three or four circuits.&lt;ref name="sinha2008"/&gt;

===Rituals: Agnihotra===
{{Main|Agnihotra|Yajna| Śrauta}}

The ''Agnihotra'' involves fire, and the term refers to the ritual of keeping fire at home, and in some cases making "sacrificial offerings" such as milk and seeds to this fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H.W. |last=Bodewitz |title=The Daily Evening and Morning Offering: (Agnihotra) According to the "Brāhmaṇas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3e4E4dqZH0C|year=1976|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-04532-3|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Srauta]] texts state that it is the duty of man to perform ''Agnihotra''. A wide range of Agnihotra procedures are found in the [[Brahmana]] layer of the Vedas, ranging from the most common simple keeping of sacred fire and its symbolism, to more complicated procedures for the expiation of guilt, to rituals claimed to grant immortality to the performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H.W. |last=Bodewitz |title=The Daily Evening and Morning Offering: (Agnihotra) According to the "Brāhmaṇas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3e4E4dqZH0C|year=1976|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-04532-3|pages=5–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Jaiminiya Brahmana'', for example, an ''Agnihotra'' sacrifice frees the performer from evil and death.&lt;ref name="Essays"&gt;{{cite book|title=Essays in Indian Philosophy, Religion and Literature|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=54, 55|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=b2qPLswTCSIC&amp;pg=PA55 |isbn=9788120819788|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, states the Shatapatha Brahmana, ''Agnihotra'' is a symbolic reminder and equivalent to the Sun, where the fire keeper is reminded of the heat that creates life, the fire in beings, the heat in the womb behind the cycle of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Satapatha-Brahmana|pages=327–329|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aNE2AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA327 |last1=Eggeling|first1=Julius|year=1882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major festivals in Hinduism, namely Holi (festival of colors) and Diwali (festival of lights) incorporate Agni in their ritual grammar, as a symbol of divine energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Elizabeth |last=Peirce |title=Multi-Faith Activity Assemblies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0yBAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA239 |year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-41163-4|pages=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen P. |last=Huyler |year=2002 |title=Meeting God: Elements of Hindu Devotion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cnNcDn36VHcC |publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-08905-9|pages=60–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the autumn celebrations of Diwali, traditional small fire lamps called ''Diya'' are included to mark the festivities.

===Forms===
Agni has two forms: ''[[Jataveda]]'' and ''Kravyada'':
* ''Jātaveda'' is the fire that carries the quid-pro-quo offerings to the gods, in which case Agni is light identified with knowledge and with Brahman. In the ''[[Jātaveda]]'' form, "He who knows all creatures", Agni acts as the divine model for the priest. He is the messenger who carries the oblation from humans to the gods, bringing the Gods to sacrifice, and intercedes between gods and humans (Rig Veda I.26.3). Together with Indra and [[Soma (deity)|Soma]], Agni is invoked in the Rig Veda more than any other gods.&lt;ref&gt;Doniger, Wendy (2010). ''The Hindus: An Alternative History''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-959334-7}} (Pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Kravyād'' (क्रव्याद) is the form of Agni which cremates corpses, the fire of the funeral pyre that triggers the recycling of matter and spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Danielle |last=Feller |year=2004 |title=Sanskrit Epics |page=91 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=9788120820081 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3yQJU-4mOoC&amp;pg=PA91}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, states Shatapatha Brahmana in verse 2.2.4.8, after one's death and at the time of cremation, Agni heats up and burns only the body, yet by its heat, one is reborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter O. |last=Kaelber |year=1989 |title=Tapta Marga: Asceticism and Initiation in Vedic India |pages=36, 37, 52 |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=9780887068133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JctmC87IhUgC&amp;pg=PA37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===
Agni is symbolism for psychological and physiological aspects of life, states Maha Purana{{Clarify|date=November 2021|reason=There is no clarification of what this Maha purana is. Maha purana can be a hindu text but also a Jainist text.}} section LXVII.202–203. There are three kinds of Agni inside every human being, states this text, the ''krodha-agni'' or "fire of anger", the ''kama-agni'' or "fire of passion and desire", and the ''udara-agni'' or "fire of digestion". These respectively need introspective and voluntary offerings of forgiveness, detachment and fasting, if one desires spiritual freedom and liberation.&lt;ref name=bettina225/&gt;

Agni variously denotes the natural element fire, the supernatural deity symbolized by fire and the inner natural will aspiring for the highest knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John A. |last=Grimes |year=1996 |title=A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy |page=18 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=9780791430675 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcoUFYOX0bEC&amp;pg=PA18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Categorisation in Indian Philosophy|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|page=14|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zsIMAAAAIAAJ |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bina |last=Gupta |date=19 April 2012 |title=An Introduction to Indian Philosophy |pages=22, 24 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136653100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WepAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agni, who is addressed as ''Atithi'' ('guest'), is also called ''Jatavedasam'' (जातवेदसम्), meaning "the one who knows all things that are born, created or produced".{{refn|Rig Veda I.xliv.4}} He symbolizes will-power united with wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R.L. |last=Kashyap |title=Agni in Rig Veda |page=14 |publisher=Sri Aurobindo Kapali Sastry Institute of Vedic Culture |id={{ASIN|817994042X|country=in}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agni is the essence of the knowledge of Existence. Agni destroys ignorance and all delusions, removes nescience. The Kanvasatpathabrahmanam (SB.IV.i.iv.11) calls Agni "wisdom" (मेधायैमनसेऽग्नये स्वाहेति).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kanvasatpathabrahmanam Vol.3|publisher=Motilal Banarsidas|page=21|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rEpF0GY-vn0C&amp;pg=PA21 |isbn=9788120815490|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agni is symbolism for "the mind swiftest among (all) those that fly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rig Veda|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=783|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgzVAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA783 |isbn=9780199720781|date=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving artwork of Agni have been found at archaeological sites near [[Mathura]] (Uttar Pradesh), and these date from 1st-century BCE.&lt;ref name=quantanilla2007&gt;{{cite book  |first=Sonya Rhie |last=Quantanilla |year=2007 |title=History of Early Stone Sculpture of Mathura |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-9004155374 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7Cb8IkZVSMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=215, 366–367, xix, with caption for Figure 86}} In the collection at Bharat Kalā Bhavan, there is a red sandstone sculpture from around the start of the common era but no later than 1st-century CE, identifiable as Agni shown in the garb of a Brahmin, very much like sage [[Kashyapa]]. In the [[Panchala]] coins of [[Agnimitra]], a deity is always present with a halo of flames. In [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] sculptures, Agni is found with a halo of flames round the body, the sacred thread across his chest, a beard, pot-bellied and holding in his right hand a ''amrtaghata'' (nectar-pot).&lt;ref name=quantanilla2007/&gt;{{rp|pages=215–216}} Many of these early carvings and early statues show just one head, but elaborate details such as ear-rings made of three fruits, a detailed necklace, a slightly smiling face wearing a crown, and flames engraved into the hairs at the back of Agni's statue.&lt;ref name=quantanilla2007/&gt;{{rp|pages=215}}

The iconographic statues and reliefs of god Agni are typically present in the southeast corners of a Hindu temple. However, in rare temples where Agni is envisioned as a presiding astrological divinity, according to texts such as the ''Samarangana Sutradhara'', he is assigned the northeast corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stella Kramrisch |author2=Raymond Burnier |year=1976 |title=The Hindu Temple |page=33 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0223-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNcXrBlI9S0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agni is historically considered to be present in every grihastha (home), and therein presented in one of three forms – ''gārhapatya'' (for general domestic usage), ''āhavaniya'' (for inviting and welcoming a personage or deity) and ''dakshinagni'' (for fighting against all evil).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=B.K. |last=Chaturvedi |title=Agni Purana |pages=18, 21 |publisher=Diamond Pocket Books |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTT72k9avd0C&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yāska]] states that his predecessor Sākapuṇi regarded the threefold existence of Agni as being in earth, air and heaven as stated by the Rig Veda, but a Brāhmana considered the third manifestation to be the Sun.

==Mythologies==
[[File:107 Agni, Unknown, 14-15th c (23381231282).jpg|thumb|upright|Agni seated on a ram, 14th–15th century Indonesia.]]
A sage of the [[Rig Veda|Ṛg Veda]] (Sūkta IV.iii.11) states that the Sun became visible when Agni was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur Anthony |last=MacDonell |year=1995 |title=Vedic Mythology |pages=88–99 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=9788120811133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC&amp;pg=PA93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epics===
Offended by Agni, [[Bhrigu|Bhṛgu]] had cursed Agni to become the devourer of all things on this earth, but [[Brahma]] modified that curse and made Agni the purifier of all things he touched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World |year=1992 |volume=1 |pages=210, 212 |publisher=Concept Publishing |isbn=9788170223740 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&amp;pg=PA213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Khāṇḍava-daha Parva" ([[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]] CCXXV), Agni in disguise approaches [[Krishna]] and [[Arjuna]] seeking sufficient food for gratification of his hunger; and on being asked about the kind of food which would gratify, Agni expressed the desire to consume the forest of Khāṇḍava protected by Indra for the sake of [[Takshaka|Takṣaka]], the chief of the ''[[Naga Kingdom|Nāga]]''s. Aided by Krishna and Arjuna, Agni consumes the ''[[Khandava Forest|Khāṇḍava Forest]]'', which burnt for fifteen days, sparing only Aswasena, Maya, and the four birds called ''sarangakas''; later, as a boon Arjuna got all his weapons from Indra and also the bow, ''[[Gandiva|Gāṇḍīva]]'', from [[Varuna|Varuṇa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mahabharata |volume=Book 1 |pages=434–447 |website=Sacred-texts.com |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01226.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is the story about King [[Shibi (king)|Shibi]] who was tested by Agni assuming the form of a pigeon and by Indra assuming the form of a hawk; Shibi offered his own flesh to the hawk in exchange of pigeon's life. The pigeon which had sought Shibi's shelter was thus saved by the king's sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=April 2008 |title=Eastern Wisdom |page=200 |publisher=Wilder Publications |isbn=9781604593051 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2n2iVpqlLh8C&amp;pg=PA200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Agniparīkṣā'' or 'the Fire test' has Agni as the witness. In the Rāmāyaṇa, [[Sita|Sītā]] voluntarily goes through this ordeal to prove her virtue.

===Puranas===
Agni is the eldest son of Brahma. In the [[Vishnu Purana|Viṣṇu Purāṇa]], Agni, called ''Abhimāni'' is said to have sprung from the mouth of the ''Virāt Puruṣa'', the Cosmic Man. In another version, Agni emerged from the ritual fire produced by the wife of Dharma (eternal law) named Vasubhāryā (literally, "daughter of Light").&lt;ref name="Danielou" /&gt;

According to the Puranic mythology, Agni married [[Svaha|Svāhā]] (invocation offering) and fathered three sons – Pāvaka (purifier), Pāvamāna (purifying) and Śuchi (purity). From these sons, he has forty-five grandchildren which are symbolic names of different aspects of a fire.&lt;ref name="Danielou"&gt;{{cite book |first=Alain |last=Danielou |date=December 1991 |title=The Myths and Gods of India |page=88 |publisher=Inner Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9RrAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88 |isbn=9781594777332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dowson |first=John |year=1961 |title=A Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology and Religion: Geography, history, and literature |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=0-7661-7589-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6JB-KOXy5k8C&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some texts, Medhā (intelligence) is Agni's sister.&lt;ref name="Danielou" /&gt;

==Relationships==

===Wife and children===
Goddess Svāhā is Agni's wife. Her name is pronounced with offerings such as butter and seeds poured into the fire during ceremonies. However, like many names in Hindu traditions, the name Svāhā embeds symbolic meanings, through its relationship with the Vedic word ''Svadhā'' found in the hymns of the ṚgVeda. Thomas Coburn states that the term ''Svadhā'' refers to "one's own particular nature or inclination", and the secondary sense of "a customary pleasure or enjoyment, a refreshment that nourishes".&lt;ref name=coburn164&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas B. |last=Coburn |year=1988 |title=Devī-Māhātmya: The Crystallization of the Goddess Tradition |pages=164–165 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0557-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hy9kf7_TOHgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Svāhā'' is also found in the hymns of the Vedic literature, in the sense of "welcome, praise to you". This salutation is a remembrance of Agni, as an aspect of that which is "the source of all beings".&lt;ref name=coburn164/&gt; As a goddess and wife of Agni, Svāhā represents this [[Shakti]].&lt;ref name=coburn166&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas B. |last=Coburn |year=1988 |title=Devī-Māhātmya: The Crystallization of the Goddess Tradition |pages=165–166, 317–318 with footnotes |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0557-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hy9kf7_TOHgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the text ''[[Devi Mahatmya|Devi Māhātmya]]'' of the goddess tradition of Hinduism ([[Shaktism]]), and in the Hindu mythologies, Svāhā is the daughter of [[Daksha]], Svāhā has a crush for Agni. She seduces him by successively impersonating six of seven women at a ''gurukul'' (school) that Agni desired for, and thus with him has a baby who grows to become god [[Kartikeya|Skanda]] – the god of war. Other chapters suggest he was the son of the god [[Shiva]].&lt;ref name=coburn166/&gt;

The Mahābhārata also mentions that when Agni was residing at [[Mahishmati]] he fell in love with the daughter of king Nila. In the guise of a Brahmana, he asked for the hand of the princess, but the king refused and was about to punish him. Agni revealed his true form and flamed up in wrath. The frightened king apologized and bestowed his daughter on Agni. In return, Agni promised protection of the city during any invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata Sabha Parva Digvijaya Parva Section XXXI&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other gods===
Agni is identified with same characteristics, equivalent personality or stated to be identical as many major and minor gods in different layers of the Vedic literature, including Vāyu, Soma, Rudra (Shiva), Varuṇa and Mitra.&lt;ref name=smith219&gt;{{cite journal |first=Frederick M. |last=Smith |year=1985 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41693607 |title=Names of Agni in the Vedic ritual |journal=Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute |volume=66 |number=1/4 |pages=219–221 with footnotes|jstor=41693607 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=macdonell95&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur Anthony |last=MacDonell |year=1898 |title=Vedic Mythology |page=95 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1113-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hymn 2.1 of the ''ṚgVeda'', in successive verses, Agni is identified to be the same as twelve gods and five goddesses.&lt;ref name=macdonell95/&gt;

Some of the gods that Agni is identified with:
* [[Prajapati|Prajāpati]]: The vedic text ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'', in section 6.1.2 describes how and why Prajāpati is the father of Agni, and also the son of Agni, because they both are the image of the one Ātman (Soul, Self) that was, is and will be the true, eternal identity of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David Shulman |author2=Guy S.

* [[Varuna|Varuṇa]] and [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]]: when Agni is born, he is Varuṇa; when he is kindled, he is Mitra.&lt;ref name=macdonell95/&gt; He is also stated to become Varuṇa in the evening, and he is Mitra when he rises in the morning.&lt;ref name=macdonell95/&gt;

''Agni'' (Sanskrit; Pali; ''Aggi'') appears in many Buddhist canonical texts, as both a god as well as a metaphor for the element of heart or fire. In Pali literature, he is also called ''Aggi-Bhagavā'', ''Jātaveda'', and ''Vessānara.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Buddhist Dictionary of Pali Proper Names |website=Tipitaka, Dreikorb, der Palikanon des Theravada Buddhismus |url=http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/dic_idx.html |access-date=23 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta]]'', presents a philosophical exchange between Buddha and a wandering ascetic named ''Śreṇika Vatsagotra'' (Sanskrit; Pali: Senika Vacchagotta).&lt;ref name=buswelllopez852/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conze1985p12"&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward |last=Conze |year=1985 |title=The Large Sutra on Perfect Wisdom: With the Divisions of the Abhisamayalankara |pages=12–13, 101–102 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-05321-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKTmmaScCGcC&amp;pg=PA678}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversation between Buddha and Śreṇika have remained a part of a debate that continues in modern Buddhism.&lt;ref name=buswelllopez852/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Damien |last=Keown |year=2006 |title=Buddhist Studies from India to America: Essays in Honor of Charles S.

Śreṇika suggested that there is an eternal Self (Atman) that lives in a temporary physical body and is involved in rebirth. In the Buddhist traditions, the Buddha taught there is rebirth and [[Anatta|Anātman]], or that there is no eternal Self. The Pali texts state that Śreṇika disagreed and asked the Buddha many questions, which the Buddha refused to answer, calling his questions as indeterminate. The Buddha clarified that were he to answer Śreṇika's questions, it would "entangle" him.&lt;ref name=buswelllopez852/&gt; The Buddha explains the Dharma with Agni as a metaphor, stating that just like fire is extinguished and no longer exists after it is extinguished, in the same way all ''[[skandha]]'' that constitute a human being are extinguished after death. Different versions of this debate appear throughout scripture across traditions, such as the ''[[Mahaparinibbana Sutta|Mahāparinibbāṇa Sutta]]'', and the ''[[Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa|Mahāprajñāpāramitōpadeśa]].'' In some versions, Śreṇika offers his own simile of Agni to further his views.&lt;ref name=buswelllopez852/&gt; Scholars such as [[Nagarjuna]] have extensively commented on the Śreṇika heresy.&lt;ref name="Conze1985p12"/&gt;

In a manner similar to the Hindu texts, the Buddhist texts also treat Agni (referred to as the fire element ''Tejas'') as a fundamental material and building block of nature. For example, in section 11.31 of the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' as well as the Rūpakaṇḍa section of the ''[[Dhammasangani]]'', Agni and Tejas are credited as that which warms, ages, burns and digests food and life processes.&lt;ref name=bettina225/&gt;

===Art===
Agni is featured prominently in the art of the [[Mahayana]] tradition.

In Tibet, he is one of the fifty-one Buddhist deities found in the mandala of [[Bhaisajyaguru|medicine Buddha]].&lt;ref name=rubinagni/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Eng Soon Teoh | year=2016 | title=Medicinal orchids of Asia | pages=33–49 | publisher=Springer | location=Singapore | isbn=978-3-319-24272-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appears in Tibetan [[Manjushri| Manjushri's]] mandalas as well, where he is depicted with Brahma and Indra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Steven Kossak |author2=Jane Casey Singer |author3=Robert Bruce-Gardner |year=1998 |title=Sacred Visions: Early Paintings from Central Tibet|pages=68–69, 158–159 |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |isbn=978-0-87099-862-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTN6hDziKC0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tibetan iconography for Agni strongly resembles that found in the Hindu tradition, with elements such as red-colored skin, a goat vehicle, conical hair and crown, a beard, and wielding a pot of water or fire in one hand, and rosary beads in the other. Such art will often include Buddhist themes such as the dharma wheel, white conch, golden fish, elephant, the endless knot.&lt;ref name=rubinagni&gt;{{cite web |title=Agni, God of Fire, 15th Century Art Work |website=Rubin Museum of Art |url=http://rubinmuseum.org/collection/artwork/agni-god-of-fire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Theravada]] traditions, such as that found in Thailand, Agni is a minor deity. Agni is called ''Phra Phloeng'' (also spelled ''Phra Plerng'', literally, "holy flames").&lt;ref name="Clontz2016p250"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jack M. |last=Clontz |year=2016 |title=Khon Mask: Thailand Heritage |page=250 |publisher=MOCA Bangkok |isbn=978-1-78301-872-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VzTFCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Justin Thomas McDaniel |author2=Lynn Ransom |year=2015 |title=From Mulberry Leaves to Silk Scrolls: New approaches to the study of Asian manuscript traditions |pages=26–27, 35 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-4736-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KL-XCgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is commonly depicted with two faces, eight arms, red in color, wearing a headdress in the shape of a gourd, and emitting flames.

In East Asian Buddhism, Agni is a [[dharmapāla]] and often classed as one of a group of twelve deities (Japanese: [[:ja:十二天|Jūniten]], 十二天) grouped together as directional guardians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Twelve heavenly deities (devas) |publisher=Nara National Museum |place=Japan |website=emuseum.jp |url=http://www.emuseum.jp/detail/100031/000/000?mode=detail&amp;d_lang=en |access-date=31 December 2015 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201634/http://www.emuseum.jp/detail/100031/000/000?mode=detail&amp;d_lang=en |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, he is called "Katen" (火天). He is included with the other eleven devas, which include Taishakuten ([[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra/Indra]]), Fūten ([[Vāyu]]), Emmaten ([[Yama]]), Rasetsuten ([[Nirṛti (god)|Nirṛti]]/[[Rakshasa|Rākṣasa]]), Ishanaten ([[Ishana|Īśāna]]), Bishamonten ([[Vaiśravaṇa|Vaiśravaṇa/Kubera]]), Suiten ([[Varuṇa]]) Bonten ([[Brahmā]]), Jiten ([[Pṛthivī]]), Nitten ([[Sūrya|Sūrya/Āditya]]), and Gatten ([[Candra]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Juuniten 十二天 |website=JAANUS |url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/j/juuniten.htm |access-date=23 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; While iconography varies, he is often depicted as an elderly mountain ascetic with two or three legs, and two or four arms.

==Jainism==

The word Agni in [[Jainism]] refers to fire, but not in the sense of Vedic ideas. Agni appears in Jain thought, as a guardian deity and in its cosmology. He is one of the eight ''dikpalas'', or directional guardian deities in Jain temples, along with these seven: Indra, Yama, Nirrti, Varuna, Vayu, Kubera and Isana. They are typically standing, with their iconography is similar to those found in Hindu and Buddhist temple pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sehdev |last=Kumar |year=2001 |title=A Thousand Petalled Lotus: Jain Temples of Rajasthan : Architecture &amp; Iconography |page=18 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn=978-81-7017-348-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSDACkmA_ukC&amp;pg=PA18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Charles Russell Coulter |author2=Patricia Turner |year=2013 |title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities |page=152 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-96390-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sEIngqiKOugC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Osian Jain temple example: {{cite book |first=Asha |last=Kalia |year=1982 |title=Art of Osian Temples: Socio-economic and Religious Life in India, 8th-12th Centuries A.D. |pages=130–131 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn=978-0-391-02558-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3n-sycLo3XQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Jain thought, living beings have souls and exist in myriad of realms, and within the earth realm shared by human beings, there are two kinds of beings: mobile and immobile.&lt;ref name=cortfire21/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Neil Dalal |author2=Chloë Taylor |year=2014 |title=Asian Perspectives on Animal Ethics: Rethinking the Nonhuman |page=40 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-74995-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQ5gAwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mobile beings – which includes tiny insects, birds, aquatic life, animals and human beings – have two or more senses, while the immobile beings have only a single sense (''ekenderiya'').&lt;ref name=bettina225/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher Key |last=Chapple |year=2006 |title=Jainism and Ecology: Nonviolence in the Web of Life |pages=xiv–xviii, 3–8 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2045-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abLZNdYxay8C&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the single sense beings are plant beings, air beings (whirlwind{{efn|For other examples from ''Uttaradhyayana Sutra'' text of Jainism, see Chapple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher Key |last=Chapple |year=2006 |title=Jainism and Ecology: Nonviolence in the Web of Life |page=56 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2045-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abLZNdYxay8C&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}), earth beings (clay), water beings (dew drop) and fire beings (burning coal, meteor, lightning).

In their spiritual pursuits, Jain monks go to great lengths to practice Ahimsa; they neither start Agni nor extinguish Agni because doing so is considered violent to "fire beings" and an act that creates harmful [[Karma]].&lt;ref name=bettina225/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher Key |last=Chapple |year=2006 |title=Jainism and Ecology: Nonviolence in the Web of Life|pages=46, 31–48 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2045-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abLZNdYxay8C&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient medicine and food==
{{main article|Agni (Ayurveda)}}
Agni, as constitutive principle of fire or heat, was incorporated in Hindu texts of ancient medicine such as the ''[[Charaka Samhita]]'' and ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]''. It is, along with Soma, the two classification premises in the pre-4th century CE medical texts found in Hinduism and Buddhism. Agni-related category, states Dominik Wujastyk, included that of "hot, fiery, dry or parched" types, while Soma-related category included "moist, nourishing, soothing and cooling" types. This classification system was a basis of grouping medicinal herbs, seasons of the year, tastes and foods, empirical diagnosis of human illnesses, veterinary medicine, and many other aspects of health and lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. |last=Wujastyk |year=2004 |title= Agni and Soma: A Universal Classification|journal= Studia Asiatica (Bucharest, Romania)|volume=4–5 |pages=347–369 |pmid=19030111 |pmc=2585368 |doi=&lt;!-- --&gt; }};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book |first=D. |last=Wujastyk |year=2003 |title=The Roots of Ayurveda: Selections from Sanskrit Medical Writings |pages=xviii, 74, 197–198 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-044824-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TaZCwjtmzZYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Chopra |first1=Arvind |last2=Doiphode |first2=Vijay V. |year=2002 |title=Ayurvedic medicine: core concept, therapeutic principles, and current relevance |journal=[[Medical Clinics of North America]] |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=75–89 |doi=10.1016/s0025-7125(03)00073-7 |pmid=11795092}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Loukas | first1=Marios | last2=Lanteri | first2=Alexis | last3=Ferrauiola|display-authors=et al | first3=Julie | title=Anatomy in ancient India: a focus on the Susruta Samhita | journal=Journal of Anatomy | volume=217 | issue=6 | year=2010 | pages=646–650 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7580.2010.01294.x | pmid=20887391 | pmc=3039177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agni was viewed as the life force in a healthy body, the power to digest foods, and innate in food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Zimmermann | first=Francis | title=The jungle and the aroma of meats: An ecological theme in Hindu medicine | journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume=27 | issue=3 | year=1988 | pages=197–206 | doi=10.1016/0277-9536(88)90121-9 | pmid=3175704 | pmc=1036075 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Guha | first=Amala | title=Ayurvedic Concept of Food and Nutrition | journal=Ayurveda Health and Nutrition| volume=4|number=1| year=2006 | url=http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/som_articles/25 | access-date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ayurveda, states Fleischman, "the amount of Agni determines the state of health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fleischman | first=P. R. | title=Ayurveda | journal=International Journal of Social Psychiatry | volume=22 | issue=4 | year=1976 | pages=282–287 | doi=10.1177/002076407602200406 | pmid=799625 | s2cid=220642164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agni (Ayurveda)|Agni]] is an important entity in [[Ayurveda]]. Agni is the fiery metabolic energy of digestion, allows assimilation of food while ridding the body of waste and toxins, and transforms dense physical matter into subtle forms of energy the body needs. ''Jathar-agni'' determines the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, ''Bhuta-agni'' determines the production of bile in the liver, ''Kloma-agni'' determines the production of sugar-digesting pancreatic enzymes and so forth. The nature and quality of these ''agnis'' depend on one's ''dosha'' which can be – ''vata'', ''pitta'' or ''kapha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga Journal Sep–Oct 2003|publisher=Active Interest Media|page=38|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=u-kDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38 |date= September–October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agni is also known as ''Vaisvanara''. Just as the illuminating power in the fire is a part of Agni's own effulgence, even so the heating power in the foods digestive and appetizing power is also a part of Agni's energy or potency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Srimadbhagavadagita Tattvavivecani |first=Jayadayal |last=Goyandka |publisher=Gita Press |at=page&amp;nbsp;613, verses BG&amp;nbsp;15.14 |url=http://www.vedicbooks.net/srimad-bhagavad-gita-tattva-vivechani-hindi-p-16541.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whenever the world is threatened with evil, chaos, and destructive forces, Vishnu descends in the form of an [[avatar]] ''(incarnation)'' to restore the [[Hindu cosmology|cosmic order]], and protect ''[[dharma]]''.

== Iconography ==
[[File:Vishnu Kumartuli Park Sarbojanin Arnab Dutta 2010.JPG|alt=|thumb|A statue of Vishnu.|left|261x261px]]

Vishnu iconography shows him with dark blue, blue-gray or black coloured skin, and as a well-dressed jewelled man. He is typically shown with four arms, but two armed representations are also found in Hindu texts on artworks.&lt;ref name="KossakWatts2001p30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rao1993p73"/&gt;

The historic identifiers of his icon include his image holding a conch shell ([[shankha]] named [[Panchajanya]]) between the first two fingers of one hand (left back), a [[chakra]] – war discus named [[Sudarshana]] – in another (right back). The conch shell is spiral and symbolizes all of interconnected spiraling cyclic existence, while the discus symbolizes him as that which restores dharma with war if necessary when cosmic equilibrium is overwhelmed by evil.&lt;ref name="KossakWatts2001p30"/&gt; One of his arms sometimes carries a ''gada'' (club, mace named [[Kaumodaki]]) which symbolizes authority and power of knowledge.&lt;ref name="KossakWatts2001p30"/&gt; In the fourth arm, he holds a lotus flower (''[[Padma (Vishnu)|padma]]'') which symbolizes purity and transcendence.&lt;ref name="KossakWatts2001p30"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven Kossak|author2=Edith Whitney Watts|title=The Art of South and Southeast Asia: A Resource for Educators |year= 2001 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=orBAYzCRJhIC |publisher= Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn= 978-0-87099-992-5|pages= 30–31, 16, 25, 40–41, 74–78, 106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rao1993p73"&gt;{{cite book|author=T.

Each of these special forms is given a special name in texts such as the ''Agni Purana'' and ''Padma Purana''. These texts, however, are inconsistent.&lt;ref name=bidyabinod&gt;P.B.B. Bidyabinod, Varieties of the Vishnu Image, Memoirs of Archaeological Survey of India, No. 2, Calcutta, pages 23-33&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely, Vishnu is depicted bearing the bow [[Sharanga]] or the sword [[Nandaka]]. He is depicted with the [[Kaustubha]] gem in a necklace and wearing [[Vaijayanti]], a garland of forest flowers. The [[shrivatsa]] mark is depicted on his chest in the form of a curl of hair. He generally wears yellow garments.

Vishnu iconography show him either in standing pose, seated in a [[yoga]] pose, or reclining.&lt;ref name="Rao1993p73"/&gt; A traditional depiction of Vishnu is that of him reclining on the coils of the serpent [[Shesha]], accompanied by his consort [[Lakshmi]], as he "dreams the universe into reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Fred S.

== The Trimurti ==
{{Main|Trimurti}}
[[File:Trimurti_ellora.jpg|thumb|The [[Trimurti]] at [[Ellora]], with Vishnu in the middle.|left]]
Particularly in [[Vaishnavism]], the Trimurti (also known as the '''Hindu Triad''' or '''Great Trinity''')&lt;ref&gt;See Apte, p. 485, for a definition of ''Trimurti'' as 'the unified form' of Brahmā, {{IAST|Viṣṇu}} and Śiva, as well as the use of phrase "Hindu triad."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See: Jansen, p. 83, for the term "Great Trinity" in relation to the Trimurti.&lt;/ref&gt; represents the three fundamental forces ([[Guṇa|''guṇas'']]) through which the universe is created, maintained, and destroyed in [[Hindu cosmology|cyclic succession]]. Each of these forces is represented by a Hindu deity:&lt;ref&gt;For quotation defining the Trimurti see: Matchett, Freda. 2003. "'The Purāṇas'." In ''Flood'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the Trimurti system having Brahma as the creator, Vishnu as the maintainer or preserver, and Shiva as the transformer or destroyer see Zimmer (1972) p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Brahma]]:''' presiding deity of [[Rajas]] (passion, creation)
* '''Vishnu:''' presiding deity of [[Sattva]] (goodness, preservation)
* '''[[Shiva]]:''' presiding deity of [[Tamas (philosophy)|Tamas]] (darkness, destruction)
The trimurti themselves are beyond three gunas and are not affected by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2008-03-06|title=Shiva: The Auspicious One|url=https://iskconnews.org/shiva-the-auspicious-one/|access-date=2022-02-12|website=ISKCON News|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hindu tradition, the trio is often referred to as '''Brahma-Vishnu-Mahesh'''.

The concept of the avatar (or incarnation) within Hinduism is most often associated with Vishnu, the preserver or sustainer aspect of God within the Hindu [[Trimurti]]. The avatars of Vishnu descend to empower the good and to destroy evil, thereby restoring [[Dharma]] and relieving the burden of the Earth. An oft-quoted passage from the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' describes the typical role of an avatar of Vishnu:
{{Blockquote|&lt;poem&gt;
Whenever righteousness wanes and unrighteousness increases I send myself forth.
For the protection of the good and for the destruction of evil,
and for the establishment of righteousness,
I come into being age after age.
&lt;/poem&gt;|''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' 4.7–8|
|source=}}

[[Vedas|Vedic]] literature, in particular the ''[[Puranas]]'' ('ancient'; similar to [[encyclopedia|''encyclopedias'']]) and ''[[Itihasa]]'' ('chronicle, history, legend'), narrate numerous [[avatar]]s of Vishnu. The most well-known of these avatars are [[Krishna]] (most notably in the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'', ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', and ''[[Mahabharata]]''; the latter encompassing the [[Bhagavad Gita]]), and [[Rama]] (most notably in the ''[[Ramayana]]''). Krishna in particular is venerated in [[Vaishnavism]] as the ultimate, primeval, [[Transcendence (religion)#Hinduism|transcendental]] source of all existence, including all the other [[demigod]]s and gods such as Vishnu.

=== The ''Mahabharata'' ===
In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', Vishnu (as [[Narayana]]) states to [[Narada]] that He will appear in the following ten incarnations:

{{blockquote|Appearing in the forms of a swan [Hamsa], a tortoise [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Kurma]]], a fish [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Matsya]]], O foremost of regenerate ones, I shall then display myself as a boar [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Varaha]]], then as a Man-lion ([[Narasimha|Nrisingha]]), then as a dwarf [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Vamana]]], then as [[Parashurama|Rama]] of Bhrigu's race, then as [[Rama]], the son of Dasaratha, then as [[Krishna]] the scion of the Sattwata race, and lastly as [[Kalki]].|source=Book 12, Santi Parva, Chapter CCCXL (340), translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, 1883-1896&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12c039.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 12: Santi Parva: Section CCCXL|website=sacred-texts.com|access-date=2019-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;|author=|title=}}

=== The Puranas ===
Specified avatars of Vishnu are listed against some of the [[Puranas]] in the table below. However, this is a complicated process and the lists are unlikely to be exhaustive because:

* Not all Puranas provide lists ''per se'' (e.g. the Agni Purana dedicates entire chapters to avatars, and some of these chapters mention other avatars within them)
* A list may be given in one place but additional avatars may be mentioned elsewhere (e.g. the Bhagavata Purana lists 22 avatars in Canto 1, but mentions others elsewhere) 
*Manava Purana, the only Upa Purana listed 42 avatars of Vishnu.
* A personality in one Purana may be considered an avatar in another (e.g. Narada is not specified as an avatar in the Matsya Purana but is in the Bhagavata Purana)
* Some avatars consist of two or more people considered as different aspects of a single incarnation (e.g. Nara-Narayana, Rama and his three brothers)

{{Main|Dashavatara}}
The ''Dashavatara'' is a list of the so-called ''Vibhavas'', or '10 [primary] [[Avatar]]s' of Vishnu. The [[Agni Purana]], [[Varaha Purana]], [[Padma Purana]], [[Linga Purana]], [[Naradiya Purana|Narada Purana]], [[Garuda Purana]], and [[Skanda Purana]] all provide matching lists. The same ''Vibhavas'' are also found in the ''Garuda Purana'' ''Saroddhara'', a commentary or ‘extracted essence’ written by Navanidhirama about the Garuda Purana (i.e. not the [[Puranas|Purana]] itself, with which it seems to be confused):
{{blockquote|The [[Matsya|Fish]], the [[Kurma|Tortoise]], the [[Varaha|Boar]], the [[Narasimha|Man-Lion]], the [[Vamana|Dwarf]], [[Parashurama|Parasurama]], [[Rama]], [[Krishna|Krisna]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and also [[Kalki]]: These ten names should always be meditated upon by the wise. Those who recite them near the diseased are called relatives.|source=''Garuda Purana Saroddhara'', Chapter VIII, Verses 10-11, translated by E. Wood and S.V. Subrahmanyam&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.45762|title=The Garuda Purana|last=Subrahmanyam|first=S.

Apparent disagreements concerning the placement of either the [[Sugata|Buddha]] or [[Balarama]] in the ''Dashavarara'' seems to occur from the ''Dashavarara'' list in the [[Shiva Purana]] (the only other list with ten avatars including Balarama in the Garuda Purana substitutes Vamana, not Buddha). Regardless, both versions of the ''Dashavarara'' have a scriptural basis in the canon of authentic [[Vedas|Vedic]] literature (but not from the ''Garuda Purana'' ''Saroddhara'')''.''

===Vedas===
Vishnu is a [[Rigvedic deities|Rigvedic deity]], but not a prominent one when compared to [[Indra]], Agni and others.&lt;ref name="Gonda1969p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Gonda|author-link=Jan Gonda|title=Aspects of Early Viṣṇuism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8urRsuUJ9oC |year=1969|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1087-7|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just 5 out of 1028 hymns of the [[Rigveda]] are dedicated to Vishnu, although he is mentioned in other hymns.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2000p84" /&gt; Vishnu is mentioned in the [[Brahmana]] layer of text in the Vedas, thereafter his profile rises and over the history of Indian scriptures, states [[Jan Gonda]], Vishnu becomes a divinity of the highest rank, one equivalent to the Supreme Being.&lt;ref name="Gonda1969p1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p167"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell|title=Vedic Mythology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC |year=1898|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (1996 Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1113-3|pages=167–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though a minor mention and with overlapping attributes in the Vedas, he has important characteristics in various hymns of Rig Veda, such as 1.154.5, 1.56.3 and 10.15.3.&lt;ref name="Gonda1969p1" /&gt; In these hymns, the Vedic scriptures assert that Vishnu resides in that highest home where departed [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (Self) reside, an assertion that may have been the reason for his increasing emphasis and popularity in Hindu [[soteriology]].&lt;ref name="Gonda1969p1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p10"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell|title=Vedic Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC |year=1898 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (1996 Reprint) |isbn=978-81-208-1113-3|pages=9–11, 167–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also described in the Vedic literature as the one who supports heaven and earth.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2000p84" /&gt;

In the Vedic hymns, Vishnu is invoked alongside other deities, especially Indra, whom he helps in killing the symbol of evil named [[Vritra]].&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2000p84" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p18" /&gt; His distinguishing characteristic in Vedas is his association with light. Two Rigvedic hymns in [[Mandala 7]] refer to Vishnu. In section 7.99 of the Rigveda, Vishnu is addressed as the god who separates heaven and earth, a characteristic he shares with Indra. In the Vedic texts, the deity or god referred to as Vishnu is [[Surya]] or [[Savitr]] (Sun god), who also bears the name ''Suryanarayana''. Again, this link to Surya is a characteristic Vishnu shares with fellow Vedic deities named Mitra and Agni, wherein different hymns, they too "bring men together" and cause all living beings to rise up and impel them to go about their daily activities.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p29"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell|title=Vedic Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC |year=1898|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (1996 Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1113-3|pages=29–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In hymn 7.99 of Rigveda, Indra-Vishnu is equivalent and produce the sun, with the verses asserting that this sun is the source of all energy and light for all.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p29" /&gt; In other hymns of the Rigveda, Vishnu is a close friend of Indra.&lt;ref name="Nilakanta Sastri 1980"&gt;Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1980). ''Advanced History of India'', Allied Publishers, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in Rigveda, Atharvaveda and Upanishadic texts, Vishnu is equivalent to Prajapati, both are described as the protector and preparer of the womb, and according to Klaus Klostermaier, this may be the root behind the post-Vedic fusion of all the attributes of the Vedic [[Prajapati]] unto the avatars of Vishnu.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2000p84"/&gt;

In the ''[[Yajurveda]]'', [[Taittiriya Aranyaka]] (10.13.1), "[[Narayana sukta]]", Narayana is mentioned as the supreme being. The first verse of "Narayana Suktam" mentions the words ''paramam padam'', which literally mean 'highest post' and may be understood as the 'supreme abode for all Selfs'. This is also known as '''Param Dhama''', '''Paramapadam''', or '''Vaikuntha'''. Rigveda 1.22.20 also mentions the same ''paramam padam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Brahmapurāṇa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J2c6-tAt4vwC |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=1989|page=106|author1=Renate Söhnen-Thieme |author2=Renate Söhnen |author3=Peter Schreiner |isbn=9783447029605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Atharvaveda]], the mythology of a boar who raises goddess earth from the depths of cosmic ocean appears, but without the word Vishnu or his alternate avatar names. In post-Vedic mythology, this legend becomes one of the basis of many cosmogonic myth called the [[Varaha]] legend, with Varaha as an avatar of Vishnu.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p18"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell|title=Vedic Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC |year=1898|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (1996 Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1113-3|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vishnu Sukta 1.154 of Rigveda says that the first and second of Vishnu's strides (those encompassing the earth and air) are visible to the mortals and the third is the realm of the immortals. The Trivikrama describing hymns integrate salvific themes, stating Vishnu to symbolize that which is freedom and life.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2000p85"/&gt; The [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] elaborates this theme of Vishnu, as his herculean effort and sacrifice to create and gain powers that help others, one who realizes and defeats the evil symbolized by the Asuras after they had usurped the three worlds, and thus Vishnu is the saviour of the mortals and the immortals ([[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]).&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2000p85"/&gt;

The ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' contains ideas which Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism has long mapped to a pantheistic vision of Vishnu as supreme, he as the essence in every being and everything in the empirically perceived universe. In this Brahmana, states Klaus Klostermaier, Purusha Narayana (Vishnu) asserts, "all the worlds have I placed within mine own self, and my own self has I placed within all the worlds."&lt;ref name="klostermaier86" /&gt; The text equates Vishnu to all knowledge there is (Vedas), calling the essence of everything as imperishable, all Vedas and principles of universe as imperishable, and that this imperishable which is Vishnu is the all.&lt;ref name="klostermaier86"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K.

Vishnu is described to be permeating all object and life forms, states S. Giora Shoham, where he is "ever-present within all things as the intrinsic principle of all", and the eternal, transcendental self in every being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Giora Shoham|title=To Test the Limits of Our Endurance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_hOAQAAIAAJ |year=2010|publisher=Cambridge Scholars |isbn=978-1-4438-2068-4|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vedic literature, including its Brahmanas layer, while praising Vishnu do not subjugate others gods and goddesses. They present an inclusive pluralistic [[henotheism]]. According to [[Max Müller|Max Muller]], "Although the gods are sometimes distinctly invoked as the great and the small, the young and the old (Rig Veda 1:27:13), this is only an attempt to find the most comprehensive expression for the divine powers and nowhere is any of the gods represented as the subordinate to others. It would be easy to find, in the numerous hymns of the Veda, passages in which almost every single god is represented as supreme and absolute."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller|Müller, Max]]. ''History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature''. London: Spottiswoode and Co. p. 533&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upanishads===
The [[Vaishnava Upanishads]] are minor [[Upanishad]]s of [[Hinduism]], related to Vishnu theology. There are 14 Vaishnava Upanishads in the [[Muktika]] anthology of 108 [[Upanishads]].{{Sfn|Deussen|1997|p=556}} It is unclear when these texts were composed, and estimates vary from the 1st-century BCE to 17th-century CE for the texts.{{Sfn|Mahony|1998|p=290}}{{Sfn|Lamb|2002|p=191}}

These Upanishads highlight Vishnu, [[Narayana]], [[Rama]] or one of his [[avatar]]s as the supreme metaphysical reality called [[Brahman]] in Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Mahony1998p271"&gt;{{cite book|author=William K.

===Puranas===
[[File:Bhagavata Purana (Ancient Stories of the Lord) Manuscript LACMA M.88.134.4 (2 of 2).jpg|thumb|The [[Bhagavata Purana]] is centred around [[Krishna]], a Vishnu avatar.]]
Vishnu is the primary focus of the Vaishnavism-focused [[Puranas]] genre of [[Hindu texts]]. Of these, according to [[Ludo Rocher]], the most important texts are the [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Vishnu Purana]], [[Nāradeya Purana]], [[Garuda Purana]] and [[Vayu Purana]].{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=59-61}} The Purana texts include many versions of cosmologies, mythologies, encyclopedic entries about various aspects of life, and chapters that were medieval era regional Vishnu temples-related tourist guides called {{lang|sa|mahatmyas}}.{{Sfn|Glucklich|2008|p=146, '''Quote:''' The earliest promotional works aimed at tourists from that era were called ''mahatmyas''.}}

One version of the cosmology, for example, states that Vishnu's eye is at the Southern Celestial Pole from where he watches the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IsSpbyjw5DMC&amp;pg=PA273 | title = Sinister Yogis | isbn = 978-0-226-89515-4 | last1 = White | first1 = David Gordon | page=273 with footnote 47| date = 2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another version found in section 4.80 of the Vayu Purana, he is the [[Hiranyagarbha]], or the golden egg from which were simultaneously born all feminine and masculine beings of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.M Masson|title=The Oceanic Feeling: The Origins of Religious Sentiment in Ancient India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swsrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |year=2012|publisher=Springer Science|isbn=978-94-009-8969-6|pages=63 with footnote 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vishnu Purana ====
The Vishnu Purana presents Vishnu as the central element of its cosmology, unlike some other Puranas where Shiva or Brahma or goddess Shakti are. The reverence and the worship of Vishnu is described in 22 chapters of the first part of Vishnu Purana, along with the profuse use of the synonymous names of Vishnu such as Hari, Janardana, Madhava, Achyuta, Hrishikesha and others.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=246-247}}

The [[Vishnu Purana]] also discusses the Hindu concept of supreme reality called [[Brahman]] in the context of the [[Upanishad]]s; a discussion that the theistic Vedanta scholar [[Ramanuja]] interprets to be about the equivalence of the Brahman with Vishnu, a foundational theology in the [[Sri Vaishnavism]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Sucharita Adluri (2015), Textual Authority in Classical Indian Thought: Ramanuja and the Visnu Purana, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415695756}}, pages 1-11, 18-26&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bhagavata Purana ====
Vishnu is equated with [[Brahman]] in the [[Bhagavata Purana]], such as in verse 1.2.11, as "learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this non-dual substance as [[Brahman]], [[Paramatman|Paramatma]] and Bhagavan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bhagavata Purana |url=http://vedabase.net/sb/1/2/11/en |title=1.2.11 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523204721/http://vedabase.net/sb/1/2/11/en |archive-date=23 May 2006 |work=Bhaktivedanta VedaBase |quote=vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvam yaj jnanam advayam brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bhagavata Purana]] has been the most popular and widely read Purana texts relating to Vishnu avatar Krishna, it has been translated and available in almost all Indian languages.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|p=112}} Like other Puranas, it discusses a wide range of topics including cosmology, genealogy, geography, mythology, legend, music, dance, yoga and culture.{{Sfn|Kumar Das|2006| pages=172–173}}{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=138–151}} As it begins, the forces of evil have won a war between the benevolent ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s'' (deities) and evil ''[[asura]]s'' (demons) and now rule the universe. Truth re-emerges as the Vishnu avatar first makes peace with the demons, understands them and then creatively defeats them, bringing back hope, justice, freedom and good – a cyclic theme that appears in many legends.&lt;ref&gt;Ravi Gupta and Kenneth Valpey (2013), The Bhagavata Purana, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149990}}, pages 3-19&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Bhagavata Purana'' is a revered text in [[Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref&gt;Constance Jones and James Ryan (2007), Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Infobase, {{ISBN|978-0816054589}}, page 474&lt;/ref&gt; The Puranic legends of Vishnu have inspired plays and dramatic arts that are acted out over festivals, particularly through performance arts such as the [[Sattriya]], [[Manipuri dance]], [[Odissi]], [[Kuchipudi]], [[Kathakali]], [[Kathak]], [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Bhagavata Mela]] and [[Mohiniyattam]].{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|p=118}}{{Sfn|Varadpande|1987|pages=92–97}}&lt;ref&gt;Graham Schweig (2007), Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions (Editor: Yudit Kornberg Greenberg), Volume 1, {{ISBN|978-1851099801}}, pages 247-249&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other Puranas ====
Some versions of the Purana texts, unlike the Vedic and Upanishadic texts, emphasize Vishnu as supreme and on whom other gods depend. Vishnu, for example, is the source of creator deity [[Brahma]] in the Vaishnavism-focussed Purana texts. Vishnu's iconography typically shows Brahma being born in a lotus emerging from his navel, who then is described as creating all the forms in the universe, but not the primordial universe itself.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|p=[https://archive.org/details/krishnasourceboo00brya_424/page/n32 18]}} In contrast, the [[Shiva]]-focussed Puranas describe Brahma and Vishnu to have been created by [[Ardhanarishvara]], that is half Shiva and half Parvati; or alternatively, Brahma was born from [[Rudra]], or Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma creating each other cyclically in different aeons ([[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]).&lt;ref name="Stella Kramrisch 1994 pages 205-206"&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1994), The Presence of Siva, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691019307}}, pages 205-206&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Vaishnava Puranas, Vishnu takes the form of Rudra or commands Rudra to destroy the world, thereafter the entire universe dissolves and along with time, everything is reabsorbed back into Vishnu. The universe is then recreated from Vishnu all over again, starting a new ''Kalpa''.&lt;ref name="doniger71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxoaUKmMG9gC&amp;pg=PA71 |year=1988|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-61847-0|pages=71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this the ''Bhagavata Purana'' employs the metaphor of Vishnu as a spider and the universe as his web. Other texts offer alternate cosmogenic theories, such as one where the universe and time are absorbed into Shiva.&lt;ref name="doniger71" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Presence of Siva |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5BanndcIgUC |year=1993|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-01930-7|pages=274–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agama ===
The [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agama]] scripture called the [[Pancharatra]] describes a mode of worship of Vishnu.

===Sangam and Post-Sangam literature===
{{main|Thirumal}}
The Sangam literature refers to an extensive regional collection in the [[Tamil language]], mostly from the early centuries of the common era. These Tamil texts revere Vishnu and his avatars such as Krishna and Rama, as well as other pan-Indian deities such as Shiva, [[Kartikeya|Muruga]], Durga, Indra and others.&lt;ref name="padmaja27"&gt;{{cite book|author=T. Padmaja|title=Temples of Kr̥ṣṇa in South India: History, Art, and Traditions in Tamilnāḍu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pzgaS1wRnl8C&amp;pg=PA27 |year=2002|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-398-4|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishnu is described in these texts as ''mayon'', or "one who is dark or black in color" (in north India, the equivalent word is Krishna).&lt;ref name="padmaja27" /&gt; Other terms found for Vishnu in these ancient Tamil genre of literature include ''mayavan, mamiyon, netiyon, mal'' and ''mayan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=T.

Krishna as Vishnu avatar is the primary subject of two post-Sangam Tamil epics ''[[Silappadikaram]]'' and ''[[Manimekalai]]'', each of which was probably composed about the 5th century CE.&lt;ref name="padmaja30"&gt;{{cite book|author=T.

===Bhakti Movement===
Ideas about Vishnu in the mid 1st millennium CE were important to the [[Bhakti movement]] theology that ultimately swept India after the 12th century. The [[Alvars]], which literally means "those immersed in God", were Tamil Vaishnava poet-saints who sang praises of Vishnu as they traveled from one place to another.&lt;ref name="olson231"&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=Carl|title=The many colors of Hinduism: a thematic-historical introduction|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|year=2007|page=231|isbn=978-0-8135-4068-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They established temple sites such as [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam|Srirangam]], and spread ideas about [[Vaishnavism]]. Their poems, compiled as Alwar Arulicheyalgal or [[Divya Prabhandham]], developed into an influential scripture for the Vaishnavas. The [[Bhagavata Purana]]'s references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on ''bhakti'', have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins, though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that ''bhakti'' movement had parallel developments in other parts of India.{{sfn|Sheridan|1986|p={{page needed|date=January 2021}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=[[J.

==Vaishnava theology==
{{Vaishnavism}}
{{Main|Vaishnavism|Pañcaratra}}
The Bhagavata Purana summarizes the Vaishnava theology, wherein it frequently discusses the merging of the individual Self with the Absolute [[Brahman]] (Ultimate Reality, Supreme Truth), or "the return of Brahman into His own true nature", a distinctly [[Advaitic]] or non-dualistic philosophy of [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]].{{sfn|Kumar Das|2006| pages=172–173}}&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;{{Sfn|Sheridan|1986|pp=1–2, 17–25}} The concept of ''[[moksha]]'' is explained as ''Ekatva'' ('Oneness') and ''Sayujya'' ('Absorption, intimate union'), wherein one is completely lost in Brahman (Self, Supreme Being, one's true nature).&lt;ref name="Rukmani_217-218" /&gt; This, states Rukmini (1993), is proclamation of "return of the individual Self to the Absolute and its merging into the Absolute", which is unmistakably Advaitic in its trend.&lt;ref name="Rukmani_217-218" /&gt; In the same passages, the Bhagavata includes a mention of [[Bhagavan]] as the object of concentration, thereby presenting the [[Bhakti]] path from the three major paths of Hindu spirituality discussed in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.&lt;ref name="Rukmani_217-218"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rukmani|1993|pp=217–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Murray Milner Jr.|title=Status and Sacredness: A General Theory of Status Relations and an Analysis of Indian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EdqMMcYQ7r8C |year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-535912-1|pages=191–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theology in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' discusses both the sentient and the non-sentient, the Self and the matter of existence. It envisions the universe as the body of Vishnu (Krishna), state Harold Coward and Daniel Maguire. Vishnu in Gita's theology pervades all Selfs, all matter and time.&lt;ref name="coward113"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkIwI84XajEC&amp;pg=PA113|title=Visions of a New Earth: Religious Perspectives on Population, Consumption, and Ecology|author1=Harold Coward|author2=Daniel C. Maguire|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7914-4458-0|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sri Vaishnavism sub-tradition, Vishnu and Sri (goddess [[Lakshmi]]) are described as inseparable, that they pervade everything together. Both together are the creators, who also pervade and transcend their creation.&lt;ref name="coward113" /&gt;

The Bhagavata Purana, in many passages, parallels the ideas of Nirguna Brahman and non-duality of [[Adi Shankara]]. {{Sfn|Sheridan|1986|pp=1–2, 17–25}} For example:

{{Blockquote|
&lt;poem&gt;
The aim of life is an inquiry into the Truth, and not the desire for enjoyment in heaven by performing religious rites,
Those who possess the knowledge of the Truth, call the knowledge of non-duality as the Truth,
It is called [[Brahman]], the Highest [[Atman (Hinduism)|Self]], and [[Bhagavan]].
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Sūta|Bhagavata Purana 1.2.10-11, translated by Daniel Sheridan&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sheridan|1986|page=23 with footnote 17}};&lt;br /&gt;Sanskrit: कामस्य नेन्द्रियप्रीतिर्लाभो जीवेत यावता | जीवस्य तत्त्वजिज्ञासा नार्थो यश्चेह कर्मभिः ||&lt;br /&gt; वदन्ति तत्तत्त्वविदस्तत्त्वं यज्ज्ञानमद्वयम् | ब्रह्मेति परमात्मेति भगवानिति शब्द्यते || Source: [http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_purana/bhagpur.html?lang=sa Bhagavata Purana] Archive&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}

Scholars describe the Vaishnava theology as built on the foundation of non-dualism speculations in Upanishads, and term it as "Advaitic Theism."{{Sfn|Sheridan|1986|pp=1–2, 17–25}}{{Sfn|Brown|1998|p=17}} The Bhagavata Purana suggests that Vishnu and the Self (Atman) in all beings is one.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1983|pages=553–557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant states that the monism discussed in Bhagavata Purana is certainly built on the Vedanta foundations, but not exactly the same as the monism of Adi Shankara.&lt;ref name="bryant45" /&gt; The Bhagavata asserts, according to Bryant, that the empirical and the spiritual universe are both metaphysical realities, and manifestations of the same Oneness, just like heat and light are "real but different" manifestations of sunlight.&lt;ref name="bryant45"&gt;Edwin Bryant (2004), Krishna: The Beautiful Legend of God: Srimad Bhagavata Purana Book X, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0140447996}}, pages 43-48&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bhakti]] tradition of Vaishnavism, Vishnu is attributed with numerous qualities such as omniscience, energy, strength, lordship, vigour, and splendour.&lt;ref name="Tapasyananda"&gt;{{cite book | author = Tapasyananda | year =  1991 | title =  Bhakti Schools of Vedānta | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Q_VtAAAACAAJ | isbn = 978-81-7120-226-3 | publisher = Sri Ramakrishna Math | location = Madras}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vaishnava tradition started by [[Madhvacharya]] considers Vishnu in the form of Krishna to be the supreme creator, personal God, all-pervading, all devouring, one whose knowledge and grace leads to "moksha".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Deepak Sarma| editor =Edwin F.

Shiva and Vishnu are both viewed as the ultimate form of god in different Hindu denominations. Harihara is a composite of half Vishnu and half Shiva, mentioned in literature such as the [[Vamana Purana]] (chapter 36),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.313087|title=The Vamana Purana With English Translation|last=Gupta|first=anand Swarup|date=1968|pages=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in artwork found from mid 1st millennium CE, such as in the cave 1 and cave 3 of the 6th-century [[Badami cave temples]].&lt;ref&gt;Alice Boner (1990), Principles of Composition in Hindu Sculpture: Cave Temple Period, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807051}}, pages 89-95, 115-124, 174-184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TA Gopinatha Rao (1993), Elements of Hindu iconography, Vol 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120808775}}, pages 334-335&lt;/ref&gt; Another half Vishnu half Shiva form, which is also called Harirudra, is mentioned in [[Mahabharata]].&lt;ref&gt;For Harirudra citation to Mahabharata 3:39:76f see Hopkins (1969), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond Hinduism==

===Sikhism===
Vishnu is referred to as '''Gorakh''' in the scriptures of [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh|title=Sikhism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0ZmAXw7ok8C&amp;pg=PA65 |year=2011|publisher=I.B. Tauris|isbn=978-1-84885-321-8|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in verse 5 of [[Japji Sahib]], the [[Guru]] ('teacher') is praised as who gives the word and shows the wisdom, and through whom the awareness of immanence is gained. [[Guru Nanak]], according to [[Christopher Shackle|Shackle]] and Mandair (2013), teaches that the Guru are "Shiva (isar), Vishnu (gorakh), Brahma (barma) and mother Parvati (parbati)," yet the one who is all and true cannot be described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher Shackle|author2=Arvind Mandair|title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvoJV8mw0LwC |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-45101-0|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Chaubis Avtar]]'' lists the 24 avatars of Vishnu, including [[Krishna]], [[Rama]], and [[Buddha]]. Similarly, the ''[[Dasam Granth]]'' includes Vishnu mythology that mirrors that found in the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnav]] tradition.&lt;ref name=Oberoi97&gt;{{cite book|author=Harjot Oberoi|title=The Construction of Religious Boundaries: Culture, Identity, and Diversity in the Sikh Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKl84EYFkTsC |year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-61593-6|pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is of particular importance to [[Sanatan Sikh]]s, including [[Udasi]]s, [[Nirmala (sect)|Nirmalas]], [[Nanakpanthi]]s, [[Sahajdhari]], and [[Keshdhari]]/Khalsa sects of Sikhism; however, the Khalsa Sikhs disagree with the Sanatan Sikhs.&lt;ref name=Oberoi97/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sikhism/sanatan.html Sanatan Singh Sabha], Overview of World Religions, Division of Religion and Philosophy, University of Cumbria&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sanatan Sikh writers, the Gurus of Sikhism were avatars of Vishnu, because the Gurus brought light in the age of darkness and saved people in a time of evil [[Mughal Empire|Mughal-era]] persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harjot Oberoi|title=The Construction of Religious Boundaries: Culture, Identity, and Diversity in the Sikh Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKl84EYFkTsC |year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-61593-6|pages=102–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdhLAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83 |year=2013|publisher=Bloomsburg Academic|isbn=978-1-4411-0231-7|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis E.

===Buddhism===
[[File:Devinuwara Sri Vishnu Maha Devalaya in Sri Lanka.jpg|thumb|Uthpalawarna Vishnu Devalaya in Devinuwara, Matara, Sri Lanka.]]
While some Hindus consider Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu, Buddhists in Sri Lanka venerate Vishnu as the custodian deity of [[Sri Lanka]] and protector of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Swarna Wickremeratne| title = Buddha in Sri Lanka: Remembered Yesterdays| publisher = State University of New York Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cYrQnZT9JREC |year = 2012| isbn=978-0791468814 |page = 111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vishnu is also known as '''[[Upulvan]]''' or '''Upalavarṇā''', meaning 'Blue Lotus coloured'. Some postulate that Uthpala varna was a local deity who later merged with Vishnu while another belief is that Utpalavarṇā was an early form of Vishnu before he became a supreme deity in [[Puranic Hinduism]]. According to the chronicles of ''[[Mahāvaṃsa]]'', ''[[Cūḷavaṃsa]]'', and folklore in Sri Lanka, Buddha himself handed over the custodianship to Vishnu. Others believe that Buddha entrusted this task to Sakra ([[Indra]]), who delegated this task of custodianship to Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Wilhelm Geiger| title = Mahawamsa: English Translation (1908)| title-link = Mahawamsa| author-link = Wilhelm Geiger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] shrines are dedicated to Vishnu in Sri Lanka. In addition to specific Vishnu ''Kovils'' or ''Devalayas'', all Buddhist temples necessarily house shrine rooms (Devalayas) closer to the main Buddhist shrine dedicated to Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Swarna Wickremeratne| title = Buddha in Sri Lanka: Remembered Yesterdays| publisher = State University of New York Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cYrQnZT9JREC| year = 2012| isbn=978-0791468814 |page = 226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Holt states that Vishnu was one of the several Hindu gods and goddesses who were integrated into the Sinhala Buddhist religious culture, such as the 14th and 15th-century [[Lankatilaka Vihara|Lankatilaka]] and [[Gadaladeniya Vihara|Gadaladeniya]] Buddhist temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = John C Holt|title = The Buddhist Vishnu: Religious transformation, politics and culture| publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 2004|isbn= 978-0231133234|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that the medieval Sinhala tradition encouraged Visnu worship (puja) as a part of Theravada Buddhism just like Hindu tradition incorporated the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu, but contemporary [[Theravada]] monks are attempting to purge the Vishnu worship practice from Buddhist temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = John C Holt|title = The Buddhist Vishnu: Religious transformation, politics and culture| publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 2004|isbn= 978-0231133234|pages=5–7, 13–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Holt, the veneration of Vishnu in Sri Lanka is evidence of a remarkable ability over many centuries, to reiterate and reinvent culture as other ethnicities have been absorbed into their own. Though the Vishnu cult in [[Ceylon]] was formally endorsed by Kandyan kings in the early 1700s, Holt states that Vishnu images and shrines are among conspicuous ruins in the medieval capital [[Polonnaruwa]].

Vishnu iconography such as statues and etchings have been found in archaeological sites of Southeast Asia, now predominantly of the Theravada Buddhist tradition. In [[Thailand]], for example, statues of four-armed Vishnu have been found in provinces near Malaysia and dated to be from the 4th to 9th-century, and this mirror those found in ancient India.&lt;ref name=hobsonxxiii&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michel Jacq-Hergoualc'h |author2=Victoria Hobson (Translator) |title=The Malay Peninsula: Crossroads of the Maritime Silk-Road (100 BC-1300 AD) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a5rG6reWhloC&amp;pg=PR23 |year=2002|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-11973-4|page=xxiii, 116–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Vishnu statues have been discovered from the 6th to 8th century eastern [[Prachinburi Province]] and central [[Phetchabun Province]] of Thailand and southern [[Đồng Tháp Province]] and [[An Giang Province]] of [[Vietnam]].{{sfn|Guy|2014|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vO_-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131 131]–135, 145}} Krishna statues dated to the early 7th century to 9th century have been discovered in [[Takéo Province]] and other provinces of [[Cambodia]].{{sfn|Guy|2014|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vO_-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146 146]–148, 154–155}}

Archeological studies have uncovered Vishnu statues on the islands of Indonesia, and these have been dated to the 5th century and thereafter.{{sfn|Guy|2014|pages=7–9}} In addition to statues, inscriptions and carvings of Vishnu, such as those related to the "three steps of Vishnu" (Trivikrama) have been found in many parts of Buddhist southeast Asia.{{sfn|Guy|2014|pages=11–12, 118–129}} In some iconography, the symbolism of [[Surya]], Vishnu and Buddha are fused.{{sfn|Guy|2014|pages=221–225}}

In [[Japanese Buddhist pantheon]], Vishnu is known as '''Bichū-ten''' (毘紐天), and he appears in Japanese texts such as the 13th century compositions of [[Nichiren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nichiren|author-link=Nichiren|title=The Major Writings of Nichiren Daishonin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxoHJwAACAAJ |year=1987|publisher=Nichiren Shoshu International Center|isbn=978-4-88872-012-0|page=1107}}, Alternate site: [http://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/wnd-2/Appendix/C Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
[[File:Garuda Mount.jpg|thumb|270px|Statue of Vishnu riding Garuda in [[Garuda Wisnu Kencana]], [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]]]]
In [[Indonesia]], Vishnu or ''Wisnu'' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] spelling) is a well-known figure in the world of [[wayang]] ([[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesian]] Puppetry), Wisnu is often referred to as the title ''Sanghyang Batara Wisnu''. Wisnu is the god of justice or welfare, wisnu was the fifth son of [[Batara Guru]] and Batari Uma. He is the most powerful son of all the sons of Batara Guru.

Wisnu is described as a god who has bluish black or dark blue skin, has four arms, each of which holds a weapon, namely a [[Mace (bludgeon)|mace]], a [[lotus flower|lotus]], a [[trumpet]] and a [[chakra|Cakra]]. He can also do tiwikrama, become an infinitely large giant.

According to [[Javanese mythology]], Wisnu first came down to the world and became a king with the title Srimaharaja Suman. The country is called [[Medang Kingdom|Medangpura]], located in the present-day [[Central Java]] region. Then changed its name to Sri Maharaja Matsyapati. In addition, according to the Javanese wayang puppet version, Batara Wisnu also incarnates
Srimaharaja Kanwa, Resi Wisnungkara, Prabu Arjunasasrabahu, Sri Ramawijaya, Sri Batara Kresna, Prabu [[Airlangga]], Prabu [[Jayabaya]], Prabu Anglingdarma.

In Javanese mythology, Wisnu also incarnated as a matswa ([[fish]]) to kill the giant Hargragiwa who stole the [[Veda]]. Become Narasingha (human with a tiger head) to destroy King [[Hiranyakashipu]]. He once intended to become a Wimana ([[dwarf (folklore)|dwarf]]) to defeat Ditya Bali. Batara Wisnu also incarnated in Ramaparasu to destroy gandarwa. Menitis in Arjunasasra / Arjunawijaya to defeat King Rahwana. The last one was for King Krishna to become the great Pandavas parampara or advisor to get rid of greed and evil committed by the [[Kauravas]].

Sang Hyang Wisnu has a mount in the form of a giant [[garuda]] named ''Bhirawan''. Because of his affection for the garuda he rode, Bhirawan was then adopted as son-in-law, married to one of his daughters named Dewi Kastapi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W5YLAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=wisnu+jawa|title= Layang kandha kelir Jawa Timuran: seri Mahabharata |year= 2007 |publisher= Surwedi|isbn= 9789791596923 |access-date=20 February 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest surviving grand Vishnu temples in India have been dated to the [[Gupta Empire]] period. The Sarvatobhadra temple in [[Jhansi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], for example, is dated to the early 6th century and features the ten avatars of Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Lubotsky (1996), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4629500 The Iconography of the Viṣṇu Temple at Deogarh and the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa], Ars Orientalis, Vol. 26 (1996), page 65&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|p=7}} Its design based on a square layout and Vishnu iconography broadly follows the 1st millennium Hindu texts on architecture and construction such as the ''Brihat Samhita'' and ''Visnudharmottarapurana''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Lubotsky (1996), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4629500 The Iconography of the Viṣṇu Temple at Deogarh and the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa], Ars Orientalis, Vol. 26 (1996), pages 66-80&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence suggest that Vishnu temples and iconography probably were already in existence by the 1st century BCE.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|p=18 with footnote 19}} The most significant Vishnu-related epigraphy and archaeological remains are the two 1st century BCE inscriptions in [[Rajasthan]] which refer to temples of Sankarshana and Vasudeva, the Besnagar Garuda column of 100 BCE which mentions a Bhagavata temple, another inscription in [[Naneghat]] cave in [[Maharashtra]] by a Queen Naganika that also mentions Sankarshana, Vasudeva along with other major Hindu deities and several discoveries in [[Mathura]] relating to Vishnu, all dated to about the start of the common era.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|p=18 with footnote 19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Doris Srinivasan|title=Many Heads, Arms, and Eyes: Origin, Meaning, and Form of Multiplicity in Indian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZheP9dIX9wC |year=1997|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-10758-8|pages=211–220, 240–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Doris Srinivasan|title=Mathurā: The Cultural Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82vtCre6vTcC|year=1989|publisher=Manohar|isbn=978-81-85054-37-7|pages=389–392}};&lt;br /&gt;[b] {{cite book|author=Doris Srinivasan|editor=Joanna Gottfried Williams|title=Kalādarśana: American Studies in the Art of India|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-qoeAAAAIAAJ |year=1981|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-06498-0|pages=127–136|chapter=Early Krishan Icons: the case at Mathura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the seventh and one of the most popular ''[[avatar]]s'' of [[Vishnu]]. In Rama-centric traditions of Hinduism, he is considered the Supreme Being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tulasīdāsa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VV7leonJ8aQC&amp;pg=PA871|title=Sri Ramacaritamanasa|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1999|isbn=978-81-208-0762-4|pages=871–872|translator-last=Prasad|translator-first=RC|author-link=Tulsidas|translator-link=R.

Rama is said to have been born to [[Kaushalya]] and [[Dasharatha]] in [[Ayodhya]], the capital of the Kingdom of [[Kosala]]. His siblings included [[Lakshmana]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], and [[Shatrughna]]. He married [[Sita]]. Though born in a royal family, Rama's life is described in the Hindu texts as one challenged by unexpected changes such as an exile into impoverished and difficult circumstances, ethical questions and moral dilemmas.&lt;ref name="Brackney2013p238"/&gt; Of all his travails, the most notable is the kidnapping of Sita by demon-king [[Ravana]], followed by the determined and epic efforts of Rama and Lakshmana to gain her freedom and destroy the evil Ravana against great odds. The entire life story of Rama, Sita and their companions allegorically discusses duties, rights and social responsibilities of an individual. It illustrates [[dharma]] and dharmic living through model characters.&lt;ref name="Brackney2013p238"&gt;{{cite book|author=William H.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
Rama is also known as Ram, Raman, Ramar,{{Refn|Many Indian languages, such as Hindi, delete the terminal 'a' sound in Sanskrit words. Others, such as Tamil and Malayalam, have their own suffixes; -r and -n in this case. [[Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/15617/why-we-put-a-after-each-hindu-name/15622|title=Why we put 'a' after each Hindu name|website=Hinduism.Stackexchange|access-date=8 March 2021|date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-greek}} and Ramachandra ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|r|ɑː|m|ə|ˈ|tʃ|ae|n|d|r|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LPD|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IAST3|Rāmacandra}}, {{Lang-sa|रामचन्द्र}}). ''Rāma'' is a Vedic Sanskrit word with two contextual meanings. In one context as found in ''[[Atharva Veda]]'', as stated by [[Monier Monier-Williams]], means "dark, dark-colored, black" and is related to the term ''ratri'' which means night. In another context as found in other Vedic texts, the word means "pleasing, delightful, charming, beautiful, lovely".&lt;ref name="mmwrama"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary --र|url=https://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/218.html#raama|access-date=6 March 2021|website=sanskrit.inria.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=parpola264/&gt; The word is sometimes used as a suffix in different Indian languages and religions, such as Pali in Buddhist texts, where ''-rama'' adds the sense of "pleasing to the mind, lovely" to the composite word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids|author2=William Stede|title=Pali-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC&amp;pg=PA521 |year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7|page=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rama'' as a first name appears in the Vedic literature, associated with two patronymic names – Margaveya and Aupatasvini – representing different individuals. A third individual named ''Rama Jamadagnya'' is the purported author of hymn 10.110 of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' in the Hindu tradition.&lt;ref name=mmwrama/&gt; The word ''Rama'' appears in ancient literature in reverential terms for three individuals:&lt;ref name=mmwrama/&gt;

#[[Parashurama|Parashu-rama]], as the sixth [[avatar]] of Vishnu. He is linked to the ''Rama Jamadagnya'' of the ''Rigveda'' fame.
#'''Rama-chandra''', as the seventh avatar of Vishnu and of the ancient ''Ramayana'' fame.
#[[Balarama|Bala-rama]], also called ''Halayudha'', as the elder brother of [[Krishna]] both of whom appear in the legends of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.

The name Rama appears repeatedly in Hindu texts, for many different scholars and kings in mythical stories.&lt;ref name=mmwrama/&gt; The word also appears in ancient [[Upanishad]]s and [[Aranyaka]]s layer of Vedic literature, as well as music and other post-Vedic literature, but in qualifying context of something or someone who is "charming, beautiful, lovely" or "darkness, night".&lt;ref name=mmwrama/&gt;

The Vishnu avatar named Rama is also known by other names. He is called ''Ramachandra'' (beautiful, lovely moon),&lt;ref name=parpola264&gt;{{cite book|author=Asko Parpola|title=Studia Orientalia, Volume 84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jkBZAAAAMAAJ |year=1998|publisher=Finnish Oriental Society|isbn=978-951-9380-38-4|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Dasarathi'' (son of Dasaratha), or ''Raghava'' (descendant of Raghu, solar dynasty in Hindu cosmology).&lt;ref name=mmwrama/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wagenaar|first=Hank W.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kWROaer5UsC&amp;pg=PA528|title=Allied Chambers transliterated Hindi-Hindi-English dictionary|last2=Parikh|first2=S.

Additional names of Rama include ''Ramavijaya'' ([[Javanese language|Javanese]]), ''Phreah Ream'' ([[Khmer language|Khmer]]), ''Phra Ram'' ([[Lao language|Lao]] and [[Thai language|Thai]]), ''Megat Seri Rama'' ([[Malay language|Malay]]), ''Raja Bantugan'' ([[Maranao]]), ''Ramudu'' ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]), ''Ramar'' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rajarajan |first1=R.K.K. |title=Sītāpaharaṇam: Changing thematic Idioms in Sanskrit and Tamil.

In some Advaita Vedanta inspired texts, Rama connotes the metaphysical concept of Supreme [[Brahman]] who is the eternally blissful spiritual Self (Atman, soul) in whom [[yogi]]s delight nondualistically.{{Sfn|Ramdas Lamb|2012|p=31}}

The root of the word ''Rama'' is ''ram-'' which means "stop, stand still, rest, rejoice, be pleased".&lt;ref name=parpola264/&gt;

According to [[Douglas Q. Adams]], the Sanskrit word ''Rama'' is also found in other Indo-European languages such as [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] ''ram'', ''reme'', ''*romo-'' where it means "support, make still", "witness, make evident".&lt;ref name=parpola264/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adams|author2=Douglas Q.

==Legends==
This summary is a traditional legendary account, based on literary details from the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and other historic mythology-containing texts of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]. According to [[Sheldon Pollock]], the figure of Rama incorporates more ancient "morphemes of Indian myths", such as the mythical legends of ''Bali'' and ''Namuci''. The ancient sage [[Valmiki]] used these morphemes in his ''Ramayana'' [[simile]]s as in sections 3.27, 3.59, 3.73, 5.19 and 29.28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vālmīki|author2=Sheldon I.

The ancient epic ''Ramayana'' states in the ''Balakhanda'' that Rama and his brothers were born to Kaushalya and Dasharatha in [[Ayodhya]], a city on the banks of [[Sarayu River (Ayodhya)|Sarayu River]].&lt;ref name="Guruge1991p51"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ShrimadValmikiRamayan-SanskritTextWithHindiTranslation-DpSharma10/ShrimadValmikiRamayan-SktHindi-DpSharmaVol01-BalaKanda1927#page/n177/mode/2up ''Valmiki Ramayana''], ''Bala Kanda''&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain versions of the ''Ramayana'', such as the ''Paumacariya'' (literally deeds of Padma) by Vimalasuri, also mention the details of the early life of Rama. The Jain texts are dated variously, but generally pre-500 CE, most likely sometime within the first five centuries of the common era.&lt;ref name="cort313"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cort|first=John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MDBpq23-0QoC|title=Framing the Jina: Narratives of Icons and Idols in Jain History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-973957-8|pages=313 note 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moriz Winternitz]] states that the ''Valmiki Ramayana'' was already famous before it was recast in the Jain ''Paumacariya'' poem, dated to the second half of the 1st century CE, which pre-dates a similar retelling found in the ''Buddha-carita'' of Asvagosa, dated to the beginning of the 2nd century CE or prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Moriz|last=Winternitz|author-link=Moriz Winternitz|title=A History of Indian Literature, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JRfuJFRV_O8C&amp;pg=PA491|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Private Limited|isbn=81-208-0264-0|year=1981|pages=491–492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dasharatha]] was the king of [[Kosala]], and a part of the [[solar dynasty]] of [[Iksvaku]]s. His mother's name [[Kausalya|Kaushalya]] literally implies that she was from Kosala. The kingdom of Kosala is also mentioned in [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Jain literature|Jain texts]], as one of the sixteen ''[[Mahajanapadas|Maha janapadas]]'' of [[ancient India]], and as an important center of pilgrimage for Jains and Buddhists.&lt;ref name="Guruge1991p51"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

Rama had three brothers, according to the ''[[Balakanda|Balakhanda]]'' section of the ''[[Ramayana]]''. These were [[Lakshmana]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] and [[Shatrughna]].{{sfn|James G. Lochtefeld|2002|p=555}} The extant manuscripts of the text describes their education and training as young princes, but this is brief. Rama is portrayed as a polite, self-controlled, virtuous youth always ready to help others. His education included the [[Veda]]s, the [[Vedanga]]s as well as the martial arts.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p326"&gt;{{harvnb|Dalal|2010|pp=326–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The years when Rama grew up are described in much greater detail by later Hindu texts, such as the ''Ramavali'' by [[Tulsidas]]. The template is similar to those found for [[Krishna]], but in the poems of [[Tulsidas]], Rama is milder and reserved introvert, rather than the prank-playing extrovert personality of Krishna.{{sfn|James G. Lochtefeld|2002|p=555}}

The ''Ramayana'' mentions an archery contest organised by King [[Janaka]], where Sita and Rama meet. Rama wins the contest, whereby Janaka agrees to the marriage of Sita and Rama. Sita moves with Rama to his father [[Dasharatha|Dashratha's]] capital.{{sfn|James G. Lochtefeld|2002|p=555}}

While Rama and his brothers were away, [[Kaikeyi]], the mother of Bharata and the second wife of King Dasharatha, reminds the king that he had promised long ago to comply with one thing she asks, anything. Dasharatha remembers and agrees to do so. She demands that Rama be exiled for fourteen years to Dandaka forest.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p326"/&gt; Dasharatha grieves at her request. Her son Bharata, and other family members become upset at her demand. Rama states that his father should keep his word, adds that he does not crave for earthly or heavenly material pleasures, neither seeks power nor anything else. He talks about his decision with his wife and tells everyone that time passes quickly. [[Sita]] leaves with him to live in the forest, the brother [[Lakshmana]] joins them in their exile as the caring close brother.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p326"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Rama heads outside the Kosala kingdom, crosses Yamuna river and initially stays at Chitrakuta, on the banks of river Mandakini, in the hermitage of sage [[Vasishtha]].&lt;ref name=dalal99&gt;{{harvnb|Dalal|2010|pp=99, 326–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the exile, Rama meets one of his devotee, [[Shabari]] who happened to love him so much that when Rama asked something to eat she offered her [[ber]], a fruit. But every time she gave it to him she first tasted it to ensure that it was sweet and tasty as a testament to her devotion. Rama also understood her devotion and ate all the half-eaten bers given by her. Such was the reciprocation of love and compassion he had for his people. This place is believed in the Hindu tradition to be the same as [[Chitrakoot, Madhya Pradesh|Chitrakoot]] on the border of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The region has numerous Rama temples and is an important Vaishnava pilgrimage site.&lt;ref name=dalal99/&gt; The texts describe nearby hermitages of Vedic [[rishi]]s (sages) such as [[Atri]], and that Rama roamed through forests, lived a humble simple life, provided protection and relief to ascetics in the forest being harassed and persecuted by demons, as they stayed at different [[ashram]]s.&lt;ref name=dalal99/&gt;&lt;ref name=hindery99&gt;{{harvnb|Hindery|1978|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ten years of wandering and struggles, Rama arrives at Panchavati, on the banks of river Godavari. This region had numerous demons (''rakshashas''). One day, a demoness called Shurpanakha saw Rama, became enamored of him, and tried to seduce him.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p326"/&gt; Rama refused her. Shurpanakha retaliated by threatening [[Sita]]. Lakshmana, the younger brother protective of his family, in turn retaliated by cutting off the nose and ears of [[Shurpanakha]]. The cycle of violence escalated, ultimately reaching demon king [[Ravana]], who was the brother of Shurpanakha. Ravana comes to [[Panchavati]] to take revenge on behalf of his family, sees Sita, gets attracted, and kidnaps her to his [[Lanka|kingdom of Lanka]] ''(believed to be modern [[Sri Lanka]])''.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p326"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hindery99/&gt;

Rama and [[Lakshmana]] discover the kidnapping, worry about Sita's safety, despair at the loss and their lack of resources to take on Ravana. Their struggles now reach new heights. They travel south, meet [[Sugriva]], marshall an army of monkeys, and attract dedicated commanders such as [[Hanuman]] who was a minister of Sugriva.&lt;ref name="Ramayana"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Wzg6wFJ5xwC | title=Ramayana | publisher=University of California Press | author=B.

Ravana is represented as merely requesting that Sita stop thinking of him as an enemy and that she abandon her mistaken notion that he wants her to be his wife. By mentioning his chief queen, he is really saying that he wants Sita to be the chosen goddess of both him and his chief queen, Mandodari.}} Sita refuses him. Ravana gets enraged and ultimately reaches Lanka, fights in a war that has many ups and downs, but ultimately Rama prevails, kills Ravana and forces of evil, and rescues his wife Sita. They return to [[Ayodhya]].&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p326"/&gt;{{Sfn|Goldman|1996|p=90}}

[[File:Lord Rama Raj Tilak Ramayana.jpg|thumb|200px|Rama Raj Tilak from Ramayana]]

The return of Rama to Ayodhya was celebrated with his coronation. It is called ''Rama pattabhisheka'', and his rule itself as ''Rama rajya'' described to be a just and fair rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramashraya Sharma|title=A Socio-political Study of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Vo0OJtO6DQC&amp;pg=PA2 |year=1986|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass  |isbn=978-81-208-0078-6|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory Claeys|title=The Cambridge Companion to Utopian Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFCuoqykV9QC&amp;pg=PA240 |year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-82842-0|pages=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed by many that when Rama returned people celebrated their happiness with ''[[Diya (lamp)|diyas]]'' (lamps), and the festival of [[Diwali]] is connected with Rama's return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOnuAAAAIAAJ|title=Self-realization Magazine|date=1971|publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship|pages=[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=lOnuAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=is+diwali+connected+to+lord+rama+returned&amp;dq=is+diwali+connected+to+lord+rama+returned&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=1&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwim0d3TqJvvAhW7IbcAHXzsABsQ6AEwAHoECAYQAg 50]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Rama's accession as king, rumors emerge that Sita may have gone willingly when she was with Ravana; Sita protests that her capture was forced. Rama responds to public gossip by renouncing his wife and asking her to undergo a test before ''Agni'' (fire). She does and passes the test. Rama and Sita live happily together in Ayodhya, have twin sons named Luv and Kush, in the ''Ramayana'' and other major texts.&lt;ref name=hindery99/&gt; However, in some revisions, the story is different and tragic, with Sita dying of sorrow for her husband not trusting her, making Sita a moral heroine and leaving the reader with moral questions about Rama.{{Sfn|Hindery|1978|p=100}}&lt;ref name = "Hess2001"/&gt; In these revisions, the death of Sita leads Rama to drown himself.

===Inconsistencies===
Rama's legends vary significantly by the region and across manuscripts. While there is a common foundation, plot, grammar and an essential core of values associated with a battle between good and evil, there is neither a correct version nor a single verifiable ancient one. According to Paula Richman, there are hundreds of versions of "the story of Rama in India, Southeast Asia and beyond".&lt;ref name=richman7&gt;{{harvnb|Richman|1991|pp=7–9 (by Richman), pp. 22–46 (Ramanujan)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iyengar2005p29"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

The stories vary in details, particularly where the moral question is clear, but the appropriate ethical response is unclear or disputed.{{sfn|Richman|1991|pp=10–12, 67–85}}&lt;ref name="Horstmann1991p9"&gt;{{cite book|author=Monika Horstmann|author-link=Monika Boehm-Tettelbach|title=Rāmāyaṇa and Rāmāyaṇas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40A6s8l1lqQC |year=1991|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-03116-5|pages=9–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when demoness [[Shurpanakha]] disguises as a woman to seduce Rama, then stalks and harasses Rama's wife Sita after Rama refuses her, [[Lakshmana]] is faced with the question of appropriate ethical response. In the Indian tradition, states Richman, the social value is that "a warrior must never harm a woman".{{sfn|Richman|1991|pp=10–12, 67–85}} The details of the response by Rama and Lakshmana, and justifications for it, has numerous versions. Similarly, there are numerous and very different versions to how Rama deals with rumours against Sita when they return victorious to Ayodhya, given that the rumours can neither be objectively investigated nor summarily ignored.{{sfn|Richman|1991|pp=11–12, 89–108}} Similarly the versions vary on many other specific situations and closure such as how Rama, Sita and Lakshmana die.{{sfn|Richman|1991|pp=10–12, 67–85}}&lt;ref name=Padmanabh216/&gt;

The variation and inconsistencies are not limited to the texts found in the Hinduism traditions. The Rama story in the Jain tradition also show variation by author and region, in details, in implied ethical prescriptions and even in names – the older versions using the name Padma instead of Rama, while the later Jain texts just use Rama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Umakant P.

In some Hindu texts, Rama is stated to have lived in the ''[[Treta Yuga]]''{{Sfn|Menon|2008|pp=10-11}} that their authors estimate existed before about 5,000 BCE.

Archaeologist [[Hasmukh Dhirajlal Sankalia|H. S.

== Appearance ==

[[Valmiki]] in [[Ramayana]] describes Rama as a charming, well built person of a dark complexion (''varṇam śyāmam'') and long arms (''ājānabāhu'', meaning a person whose middle finger reaches beyond their knee).{{Sfn|Valmiki Ramayan|p=[[Ramayan#Kishkindha Kanda|kishkindha kanda]]}} In the [[Sundara Kanda]] section of the epic, [[Hanuman]] describes Rama to [[Sita]] when she is held captive in [[Lanka]]  to prove to her that he is indeed a messenger from Rama:

==Philosophy and symbolism==
Rama's life story is imbued with symbolism. According to [[Sheldon Pollock]], the life of Rama as told in the Indian texts is a masterpiece that offers a framework to represent, conceptualise and comprehend the world and the nature of life. Like major epics and religious stories around the world, it has been of vital relevance because it "tells the culture what it is". Rama's life is more complex than the Western template for the battle between the good and the evil, where there is a clear distinction between immortal powerful gods or heroes and mortal struggling humans. In the Indian traditions, particularly Rama, the story is about a divine human, a mortal god, incorporating both into the exemplar who transcends both humans and gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vālmīki|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h1g6fWIu-kAC|title=The Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki: An Epic of Ancient India.

Rama's life and comments emphasise that one must pursue and live life fully, that all three life aims are equally important: virtue (dharma), desires ([[kama]]), and legitimate acquisition of wealth ([[artha]]). Rama also adds, such as in section 4.38 of the ''[[Ramayana]]'', that one must also introspect and never neglect what one's proper duties, appropriate responsibilities, true interests, and legitimate pleasures are.&lt;ref name=hindery106/&gt;

He suggests either vocally repeating the name (''jap'') or silent repetition in mind (''ajapajap''). This concept of Rama moves beyond the divinised hero and connotes an "all-pervading Being" and equivalent to ''atmarama'' within. The term ''atmarama'' is a compound of "Atma" and "Rama", it literally means "he who finds joy in his own self", according to the French Indologist [[Charlotte Vaudeville]] known for her studies on Ramayana and Bhakti movement.{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=31–32 with footnotes 13 and 16 (by C.

Tulsidas was inspired by ''Adhyatma Ramayana'', where Rama and other characters of the ''Valmiki Ramayana'' along with their attributes (''saguna'' narrative) were transposed into spiritual terms and abstract rendering of an ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atma]]'' (soul, self, [[Brahmana|''Brahman'']]) without attributes (''[[nirguna]]'' reality).&lt;ref name=jnfarquhar158/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tulasīdāsa1989p875"/&gt;{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=31, 74–75 with footnotes, Quote: "What is striking about the dohas in the Ramcharitmanas however is that they frequently have a sant-like ring to them, breaking into the very midst of the saguna narrative with a statement of nirguna reality".}} According to Kapoor, Rama's life story in the ''Ramacharitamanasa'' combines mythology, philosophy, and religious beliefs into a story of life, a code of ethics, a treatise on universal human values.&lt;ref name="Pollet1995p181"/&gt; It debates in its dialogues the human dilemmas, the ideal standards of behaviour, duties to those one loves, and mutual responsibilities.

''Yoga Vasistha'' is a Sanskrit text structured as a conversation between young Prince Rama and sage [[Vasistha]] who was called as the first sage of the [[Vedanta]] school of Hindu philosophy by [[Adi Shankara]]. The complete text contains over 29,000 verses.&lt;ref name=chappleix&gt;{{Harvnb|Chapple|1984|pp=ix–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short version of the text is called ''Laghu Yogavasistha'' and contains 6,000 verses.&lt;ref name="Leslie2003-105"&gt;{{Harvnb|Leslie|2003|pp=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact century of its completion is unknown, but has been estimated to be somewhere between the 6{{Rp|th}} century to as late as the 14{{Rp|th}} century, but it is likely that a version of the text existed in the 1{{Rp|st}} millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chapple|1984|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Yoga Vasistha]]'' text consists of six books. The first book presents Rama's frustration with the nature of life, human suffering and disdain for the world. The second describes, through the character of Rama, the desire for liberation and the nature of those who seek such liberation. The third and fourth books assert that liberation comes through a spiritual life, one that requires self-effort, and present cosmology and metaphysical theories of existence embedded in stories.&lt;ref name="Chapple1984-xii"/&gt; These two books are known for emphasising free will and human creative power.&lt;ref name="Chapple1984-xii"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Surendranath Dasgupta, A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume 2, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-04779-1}}, pages 252–253&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth book discusses meditation and its powers in liberating the individual, while the last book describes the state of an enlightened and blissful Rama.&lt;ref name="Chapple1984-xii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chapple|1984|pp=xi–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Valmiki |title=The Concise Yoga Vāsiṣṭha |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-87395-955-8 |location=Albany |translator-last=Venkatesananda |translator-first=S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It mentions that Ayodhya was not the capital in the time of Rama's son named Kusha, but that he later returned to it and made it the capital again. This text is notable because the poetry in the text is exquisite and called a ''Mahakavya'' in the Indian tradition, and has attracted many scholarly commentaries. It is also significant because Kalidasa has been dated to between the 4th and 5th century CE, suggesting that the Ramayana legend was well established by the time of Kalidasa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The ''Mahabharata'' has a summary of the ''Ramayana''. The Jainism tradition has extensive literature of Rama as well, but generally refers to him as Padma, such as in the ''Paumacariya'' by Vimalasuri.&lt;ref name=cort313/&gt; Rama and Sita legend is mentioned in the Jataka tales of Buddhism, as ''[[Dasaratha Jataka|Dasaratha-Jataka]]'' (Tale no. 461), but with slightly different spellings such as ''Lakkhana'' for ''Lakshmana'' and ''Rama-pandita'' for ''Rama''.&lt;ref name= Francis325&gt;{{cite book|author1=H.

==== Ramlila and Dussehra====
{{Main|Vijayadashami}}
[[File:Ramlila artists.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|In Northern, Central and Western states of India, the Ramlila play is enacted during Navratri by rural artists (above).]]
Rama's life is remembered and celebrated every year with dramatic plays and fireworks in autumn. This is called [[Ramlila]], and the play follows ''[[Ramayana]]'' or more commonly the ''[[Ramcharitmanas]]''.{{sfn|James G. Lochtefeld|2002|p=389}} It is observed through thousands&lt;ref name="SchechnerHess51"/&gt; of Rama-related performance arts and dance events, that are staged during the festival of [[Navratri]] in [[India]].{{sfn | Encyclopedia Britannica | 2015}} After the enactment of the legendary war between Good and Evil, the Ramlila celebrations climax in the [[Dussehra]] (Dasara, [[Vijayadashami]]) night festivities where the giant grotesque effigies of Evil such as of demon Ravana are burnt, typically with fireworks.&lt;ref name="unescodussehra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kasbekar|first=Asha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sv7Uk0UcdM8C&amp;q=Jatra+bengal&amp;pg=PA44|title=Pop Culture India!: Media, Arts, and Lifestyle|date=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-636-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ramlila festivities were declared by UNESCO as one of the "Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity" in 2008. Ramlila is particularly notable in historically important Hindu cities of [[Ayodhya]], [[Varanasi]], [[Vrindavan]], [[Almora]], [[Satna]] and [[Madhubani district|Madhubani]] – cities in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.&lt;ref name=unescodussehra/&gt;{{sfn|James G.

====Diwali====
{{Main|Diwali}}
In some parts of India, Rama's return to Ayodhya and his coronation is the main reason for celebrating [[Diwali]], also known as the ''Festival of Lights''.{{Sfn|Gupta|1991|p=fontcover}}

In [[Guyana]], Diwali is marked as a special occasion and celebrated with a lot of fanfare. It is observed as a national holiday in this part of the world and some ministers of the Government also take part in the celebrations publicly. Just like Vijayadashmi, Diwali is celebrated by different communities across India to commemorate different events in addition to Rama's return to Ayodhya. For example, many communities celebrate one day of Diwali to celebrate the Victory of Krishna over the demon [[Narakasur]].{{Refn|As per another popular tradition, in the Dvapara Yuga period, [[Krishna]], an [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], killed the demon [[Narakasura]], who was the evil king of Pragjyotishapura, near present-day Assam and released 16000 girls held captive by [[Narakasura]]. Diwali was celebrated as a sign of the triumph of good over evil after Krishna's Victory over Narakasura. The day before [[Diwali]] is remembered as Naraka Chaturdasi, the day on which Narakasura was killed by Krishna.{{Sfn|Richman|1991|p=107}}|group=lower-greek}}

The ''Ramayana'' was translated from Sanskrit into old Javanese around 860 CE, while the performance arts culture most likely developed from the oral tradition inspired by the Tamil and Bengali versions of Rama-based dance and plays.&lt;ref name="Brandon2009p22"/&gt; The earliest evidence of these performance arts are from 243 CE according to Chinese records. Other than the celebration of Rama's life with dance and music, Hindu temples built in southeast Asia such as the [[Prambanan]] near [[Yogyakarta]] (Java), and at the [[Panataran]] near [[Blitar]] (East Java), show extensive reliefs depicting Rama's life.&lt;ref name="Brandon2009p22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Fontein (1973), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4171579 The Abduction of Sitā: Notes on a Stone Relief from Eastern Java], Boston Museum Bulletin, Vol. 71, No. 363 (1973), pp. 21–35&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Rama's life has been popular in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kats | first=J. | title=The Ramayana in Indonesia | journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=4 | issue=3 | year=1927 | page=579 | doi=10.1017/s0041977x00102976 | s2cid=162850921 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
{{see also|Rama in Jainism|Salakapurusa}}
In [[Jainism]], the earliest known version of Rama story is variously dated from the 1st to 5th century CE. This Jain text credited to [[Vimalasuri]] shows no signs of distinction between [[Digambara]]-[[Svetambara]] (sects of Jainism), and is in a combination of [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Sauraseni language]]s. These features suggest that this text has ancient roots.&lt;ref name="Doniger1993p190"&gt;{{cite book|author=John E Cort|editor=Wendy Doniger|title=Purana Perennis: Reciprocity and Transformation in Hindu and Jaina Texts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kZFzHCuiFAC |year=1993|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1381-4|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jain [[cosmology]], characters continue to be reborn as they evolve in their spiritual qualities, until they reach the Jina state and complete enlightenment. This idea is explained as cyclically reborn triads in its Puranas, called the [[Balabhadra|Baladeva]], [[Vasudeva]] and evil [[Prati-vasudeva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobi|first=Herman|title=Vimalsuri's Paumachariyam|year=2005|publisher=Prakrit Text Society|location=Ahemdabad|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Iyengar|first=Kodaganallur Ramaswami Srinivasa|title=Asian Variations in Ramayana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CU92nFk5fU4C&amp;pg=PA80

In the Jain tradition, Neminatha is believed to have been born 84,000 years before the 9th-century BCE [[Parshvanatha]].{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=226}}

Jain texts tell a very different version of the Rama legend than the Hindu texts such as by Valmiki. According to the Jain version, Lakshmana (Vasudeva) is the one who kills Ravana (Prativasudeva).&lt;ref name=Padmanabh216/&gt; Rama, after all his participation in the rescue of Sita and preparation for war, he actually does not kill, thus remains a non-violent person. The Rama of Jainism has numerous wives as does Lakshmana, unlike the virtue of monogamy given to Rama in the Hindu texts. Towards the end of his life, Rama becomes a Jaina monk then successfully attains [[siddha]] followed by [[moksha]].&lt;ref name= Padmanabh216/&gt; His first wife Sita becomes a Jaina nun at the end of the story. In the Jain version, Lakshmana and Ravana both go to the hell of Jain cosmology, because Ravana killed many, while Lakshmana killed Ravana to stop Ravana's violence.&lt;ref name= Padmanabh216/&gt; ''Padmapurana'' mentions Rama as a contemporary of [[Munisuvrata]], 20th ''[[tirthankara]]'' of Jainism.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=21–23}}

===Buddhism===
The ''Dasaratha-Jataka'' (Tale no. 461) provides a version of the Rama story. It calls ''Rama'' as ''Rama-pandita''.&lt;ref name="Francis325"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cowell78"/&gt;

At the end of this ''Dasaratha-Jataka'' discourse, the Buddhist text declares that the Buddha in his prior rebirth was Rama:

{{Blockquote|The Master having ended this discourse, declared the Truths, and identified the Birth (...): 'At that time, the king Suddhodana was king Dasaratha, Mahamaya was the mother, [[Rahula]]'s mother was Sita, Ananda was Bharata, and I myself was Rama-Pandita.

[[Sastha|Sree Vana Sastha]] [[Durga|Sree Vana Durga]] Temple, Ithiyapuram Kaavu, Swamiyar madam.

==Geography==
This ancient [[temple]] is situated in the [[National Highway (India)|National Highway]] NH-47{{citation needed|reason=Looks more like NH-44 to me|date=June 2017}} which runs from [[Kanyakumari]] to [[Thiruvananthapuram]]. It is located about 30&amp;nbsp;km from [[Nagercoil]] and about 52&amp;nbsp;km from [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and is on the [[Swamiyar madam|Swamiyarmadam]]-[[Verkilambi]] road, near the Kovikal Bridge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ithiyapuramkaavu.in|title=Ithiyapuram Kaavu Sree Vana Sastha Sree Vana Durga Temple|author=|date=|website=www.IthiyapuramKaavu.in|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kaavu.jpg|thumb|Ithiyapuram Kaavu]]

Its exact age is unknown. However, its age should be greater than an eon.

In this temple the prime [[god]] is [[Sastha|Sree Vana Sastha]] and the prime goddess is [[Durga|Sree Vana Durga]]. The gods [[Bala Ganapati]], [[Nagaraja]], [[Yakshini|Naga Yakshi]], [[Naga Kanni]], [[Sree Krishna]], Sree Eeshvarakala Boothathaan are also available. In this shrine [[Sastha|Sree Vana Sastha]], [[Durga|Sree Vana Durga]] and [[Ganapathy|Bala Ganapathy]] gods are self-manifested. There, in this shrine, Goddess [[Durga|Sree Vana Durga]] is in the state of Penance, and God [[Ganapathy|Sree Bala Ganapathy]] is regaining his original form on his own day by day.

There are golden-colored [[snakes]], white colored snakes and [[King Cobra]]s are in the forest which is in the back side of this temple and many have witnessed it long time ago. The gigantic trees which are surrounding the temple is a vital sign for this temple's eon. And no one is permitted to go into the forest area which is behind the temple.

Long ago, [[Travancore]] [[Marthanda Varma|King Marthanda Varma]] ran via this place to save his life and after becoming the King he handedover a copper record of legal documents as a gift to this [[temple]] and was said by the people during his period.
There was no one to maintain this temple for a long period and was lying dilapidated. In the reason past this temple was well maintained because of the action taken by the local public and regular workshops are taking place. During every Pankuni Uthram a festival of five days is grandly celebrated in this [[temple]]. In the month of Karthigai Mandala Pooja of 41 days, Powrnami Pooja, Aayilya Pooja are also taking place. During every evenings Santhya Pooja is taking place as a Nithya Pooja.

It is believed that Goddess [[Durga|Sree Vana Durga]] came all the way from the dense jungle of [[Pechiparai Reservoir|Pechiparai]] and in protection to her God [[Sastha|Sree Vana Sastha]] and snakes troops came there to this place. During every powrnami days one could have a dharshan of [[Nagaraja|Nager]] without fail.

Having survived as a primary deity in Hinduism longer than any most of the original Vedic deities, the worship of Surya declined greatly around the 13th century, perhaps as a result of the Muslim destruction of Sun temples in North India. New Sun temples virtually ceased to be built, and some were later repurposed to a different deity. A number of important Surya temples remain, but most are no longer in worship. In certain aspects, Surya has tended to be merged with the prominent deities of [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]], or seen as subsidiary to them.&lt;ref&gt;Pathak, Ratnesh K., Humes, Cynthia Ann, "Lolark Kund: Sun and Shiva Worship in the City of Light", [in] ''Living Banaras: Hindu Religion in Cultural Context'', Bradley R.

====Conflation with other solar deities====
Surya in Indian literature is referred to by various names, which typically represent different aspects or phenomenological characteristics of the Sun. The figure of Surya as we know him today is an amalgamation of various different Rigvedic deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Coulter|first1=Charles Russell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWxekbhM1yEC&amp;q=vivasvan&amp;pg=PT1134|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities|last2=Turner|first2=Patricia|date=2013-07-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-96397-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Savitr]] refers to one that rises and sets, Aditya means one with splendor, [[Mitra (Hindu god)|Mitra]] refers to Sun as "the great luminous friend of all mankind",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alice Boner|author2=Sadāśiva Rath Śarmā|title=New Light on the Sun Temple of Koṇārka|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_DVAAAAMAAJ|year=1972|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|oclc= 759154388|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Pushan]] refers to Sun as illuminator that helped the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] win over Asuras who use darkness.&lt;ref name=hopkins81&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Washburn Hopkins|title=Epic Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-H0eiuvcG5IC|year=1968|publisher=Biblo &amp; Tannen: New York|isbn=978-0-8196-0228-2|pages=81–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arka, Mitra, Vivasvat, Aditya, Tapan, Ravi and Surya have different characteristics in early mythologies, but by the time of the epics they are synonymous.&lt;ref name=hopkins81/&gt;

The term "Arka" is found more commonly in temple names of north India and in the eastern parts of India. The 11th century [[Konark Temple]] in [[Odisha]] is named after a composite word "Kona and Arka", or "Arka in the corner".&lt;ref name=Donaldson-2005-Konark/&gt;{{rp|page=6–7}}
Other Surya temples named after Arka include Devarka (Deva teertha) and Ularka (Ulaar) in Bihar,  Uttararka and Lolarka in [[Uttar Pradesh]], and Balarka in [[Rajasthan]]. Another 10th-century sun temple ruin is in [[Bahraich]], Uttar Pradesh named Balarka Surya Mandir, which was destroyed in the 14th century during the Turkish invasions.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Vivasvat, also known as Vivasvant,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Oldenberg|first=Hermann|title=Die Religion Des Veda|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1988|location=Delhi|pages=310|translator-last=Shrotri|translator-first=Shridhar B.|trans-title=The Religion of the Veda}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also one such of these deities. His wife is [[Saranyu]], daughter of [[Tvastar|Tvashtar]]. His sons include the [[Ashvins]], [[Yama]], and [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]. Through Manu, Vivasvat is considered an ancestor of humanity. Vivasvat is affiliated with [[Agni]] and [[Matarishvan]], with Agni being stated to have been first revealed to those two. Vivasvat is also variously related to [[Indra]], [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], and [[Varuna]]. Vivasvant is also used as an adjective of Agni and [[Ushas]] to mean "brilliant". Already by the time of his earliest appearance (the Rigveda), Vivasvat had declined in importance. He was likely a solar deity, but scholars debate his specific role as one.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Macdonnell|first=Arthur Anthony|title=Vedic Mythology|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1897|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Rigveda, Indra drinks Soma alongside Manu Vivasvat and [[Trita]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In post-Vedic literature, Vivasvat further declines in importance, and is merely another name for the sun.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He is cognate to the [[Avesta]]n Vivanhvant, who is the father of [[Jamshid|Yima]] (cognate to Yama) and Manu.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witzel|first=Michael|date=2001|title=Autochthonous Aryans?

=== Epics ===
As per the [[Ramayana]]'s Yuddha Kanda, [[Rama]] was taught the [[Ādityahṛdayam]] stotra before his war against [[Ravana]], the king of the [[Rakshasa|rakshasas]]. The stotra was composed in Anushtup Chanda in praise of Surya, who is described as the embodiment of all gods and the origin of everything in the universe.

The Mahabharata epic opens its chapter on Surya that reverentially calls him as the "eye of the universe, soul of all existence, origin of all life, goal of the [[Samkhya]]s and [[Yogi]]s, and symbolism for freedom and spiritual emancipation.&lt;ref name=Dalal-2010-hind-alph/&gt;{{rp|page=399–401}}

In the [[Mahabharata]], [[Karna]] is the son of Surya and unmarried princess [[Kunti]].&lt;ref name=Dalal-2010-hind-alph/&gt;{{rp|page=399–401}} The epic describes Kunti's trauma as an unmarried mother, then abandonment of Karna, followed by her lifelong grief. Baby [[Karna]] is found and adopted by a charioteer but he grows up to become the greatest warrior and one of the central heroes of the great war of [[Kurukshetra war|Kurukshetra]].&lt;ref&gt;

Earliest representations of Surya riding a chariot occur in the Buddhist railings of the [[Mahabodhi]] temple in [[Bodhgaya]] (2nd century BCE), in the [[Bhaja Caves]] (1st century BCE), and the [[Jain]] cave of Ananta Gumpha in [[Khandagiri]] (1st century CE).&lt;ref name="Society 1930, p. 87"/&gt; They follow similar depiction of the charriot-riding god [[Helios]] of Hellenistic mythology, as appearing for example on the coinage of [[Greco-Bactrian]] kings, such as [[Diodotus III Plato|Plato I]].&lt;ref name="OB"/&gt;

The iconography of Surya has varied over time. In some ancient arts, particularly from the early centuries of the common era, his iconography is similar to those found in Persia and Greece suggesting likely adoption of Greek, Iranian and Scythian influences.&lt;ref name="Sick2004"&gt;

The seven horses are named after the seven meters of [[Sanskrit prosody]]: Gayatri, Brihati, Ushnih, Jagati, Trishtubha, Anushtubha and Pankti.

The [[Brihat Samhita]] of [[Varaha Mihira]] ({{circa|505-587}}), a Hindu text that describes architecture, iconography and design guidelines, states that Surya should be shown with two hands and wearing a crown. It specifically describes his dress to be Northern (i.e. Central Asian, with boots).&lt;ref&gt;
Brihat Samhita, Chap. LVIII, 46-48
&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the Vishnudharmottara, another Hindu text on architecture, states Surya iconography should show him with four hands, with flowers in two hands, a staff in third, and in fourth he should be shown to be holding writing equipment (Kundi palm leaf and pen symbolizing knowledge).&lt;ref name=Dalal-2010-hind-alph/&gt;{{rp|page=399–401}} His chariot driver in both books is stated to be [[Aruṇa]] who is seated.&lt;ref name=Dalal-2010-hind-alph/&gt;{{rp|page=399–401}} Two females typically flank him, who represent the dawn goddesses named Usha and Pratyusha.

The manuscripts of these texts exist in slightly different versions, present Surya- and planets-based calculation and its relative motion to earth. These vary in their data, suggesting that the text were open and revised over their lives.&lt;ref&gt;

In both Indian and Greek-Roman nomenclature for days of the week, the Sunday is dedicated to the Sun.

Surya is a part of the [[Navagraha]] in Hindu zodiac system. The role and importance of the Navagraha developed over time with various influences. Deifying the sun and its astrological significance occurred as early as the [[Vedic period]] and was recorded in the [[Vedas]]. The earliest work of astrology recorded in India is the [[Vedanga Jyotisha]] which began to be compiled in the 14th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BCE. It was possibly based on works from the Indus Valley Civilization as well as various foreign influences.&lt;ref name="jameslochtefeldsca326"&gt;

The Navagraha developed from early works of astrology over time. The Sun and various [[classical planet]]s were referenced in the [[Atharvaveda]] around 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE. The Navagraha was furthered by additional contributions from [[Western Asia]], including [[Zoroastrian calendar|Zoroastrian]] and [[Hellenistic astrology|Hellenistic]] influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Campion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MxSr1NT3BLoC|title=Astrology and Cosmology in the World's Religions|publisher=New York University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-8147-0842-2|pages=110–111|access-date=4 September 2016|archive-date=25 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200125184655/https://books.google.com/books?id=MxSr1NT3BLoC|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yavanajataka]], or 'Science of the [[Yavana]]s', was written by the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greek]] named "[[Yavanesvara]]" ("Lord of the Greeks") under the rule of the [[Western Kshatrapa]] king [[Rudrakarman I]]. The Yavanajataka written in 120&amp;nbsp;BCE is often attributed to standardizing Indian astrology. The Navagraha would further develop and culminate in the [[Shaka era]] with the [[Saka]], or Scythian, people.

Additionally the contributions by the Saka people would be the basis of the [[Indian national calendar]], which is also called the Saka calendar.

The [[Hindu calendar]] is a [[Lunisolar calendar]] which records both lunar and solar cycles. Like the Navagraha, it was developed with the successive contributions of various works.

==Temples and worship==
Surya temples are found in many parts of India. More common than Surya temples are artwork related to Surya, which are found in all types of temples of various traditions within Hinduism, such as the [[Hindu temple]]s related to Shiva, Vishnu, Ganesha, and Shakti.{{refn|

This Ismaili Shia mosque atop the Sun Temple's ruins was then destroyed by the Sunni ruler [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], the Surya temple was not rebuilt and an empty space left in place, actions that helped re-establish the importance of the Sunni mosque in Multan.&lt;ref name="Flood"/&gt;

While Shiva and Vishnu are more common in 1st millennium southeast Asian artwork such as those found in [[Cambodia]] and [[Thailand]], archaeological evidence suggest god Surya were among the pantheon of ideas adopted early in these regions and retained after Buddhism became the dominant tradition.&lt;ref&gt;

In Kabul [[Khair Khāna]], there is a Hindu temple dedicated to Surya,&lt;ref name="Chavan2020"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chavan |first1=Akshay |title=Uncovering Afghanistan's Pre-Islamic Past |url=https://www.livehistoryindia.com/story/history-daily/afghanistans-pre-islamic-past/ |access-date=11 November 2021 |date=28 July 2020 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; of two distinct periods. The first period consisted of a mud-brick temple with possible human sacrifice remains dedicating it. This was then superseded by three distinct sanctuaries built of schist slabs, surrounded by subsidiary buildings of diaper masonry construction and an open-air altar in a semi-circular enclosure. The most important finds were two marble statues of Surya, the first example found during the original excavations (1934, Delegation Archaeologique Française Afghanistan), the second example found by accident in 1980.

In Nepal, many Surya temples and artworks trace to the medieval era, such as the 11th-century Thapahiti and Saugal-tol, and 12th century Naksal stone sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;

===Festivals===
Various festivals mark deity Surya and these vary regionally in India. [[Pongal (festival)|Pongal]] or [[Makara Sankaranti]] is the most widely celebrated Hindu festival dedicated to the Sun God. These celebrate a good harvest. Other festivals that focus on Surya include [[Chhath]] of Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh and the neighboring regions, [[Samba Dashami]] and [[Ratha Saptami]] are also major festivals celebrated in honour of Surya; Chhath is celebrated immediately after [[Diwali]] with fasting for three days followed by bathing in river or tank with remembrance of Sun.&lt;ref name=Dalal-2010-hind-alph/&gt;{{rp|page=97}}
Similarly [[Aytar Puja]] is celebrated in Goa.&lt;ref name=Goa&gt;

===Buddhism===
Surya is celebrated as a deity in Buddhist works of art, such as the ancient works attributed to [[Emperor Ashoka|Ashoka]]. He appears in a relief at the [[Mahabodhi temple]] in Bodhgaya, riding in a chariot pulled by four horses, with Usha and Prattyusha on his sides.&lt;ref name=kumarkumar/&gt; Such artwork suggests that the Surya as symbolism for the victory of good over evil is a concept adopted in Buddhism from an earlier Indic tradition.&lt;ref name=kumarkumar&gt;

On the [[Mount Meru]] buddhist cosmological system, Surya is considered a female deity, contrasting a male [[lunar god]].&lt;ref&gt;John C. Huntington, Dina Bangdel, Robert A. F. Thurman, The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art, 6 Surya Mandala&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside Indian subcontinent==
===Indonesia===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Wajangpop van karbouwenhuid Bima voorstellend TMnr 1772-528.jpg|thumb|Batara Surya [[wayang]] (puppetry) figures]]
In [[Indonesia]]. Surya ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Batara Surya'') was adapted into [[Indonesian culture]] as the god who rules the [[sun]], and was given the title "Batara". ''Batara Surya'' is famous for giving his heirlooms or gifts to the people he chooses. This god is famous for having many children from various women, among them from ''Dewi Kunti'' in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' who gave birth to ''Adipati Karna''.

Batara Surya was hit when Anoman blamed Batara Surya for what happened to his mother, Dewi Anjani and her grandmother, who had been cursed by her husband. Anoman feels Batara Surya must be responsible so Anoman with his magic collects clouds from all over the world to cover the natural world so that the rays of the sun cannot reach the earth. Fortunately, this incident can be resolved amicably so that Anoman voluntarily removes the clouds again so that the natural world is exposed to the sun again. Surya has three queens namely Saranyu (also called Saraniya, Saranya, Sanjna, or Sangya), Ragyi, and Prabha. Saranyu is the mother of Vaiwaswata Manu (seventh Manu, the present day), and twins [[Yama]] (god of death) and his sister Yami. She also bore him the twins known as [[Asvins|Aswin]], and the gods. Saranyu, unable to witness the bright light from Surya, created a clone of herself named Chaya, and orders her to act as Surya's wife during her absence. Chaya had two sons by ''Surya-Sawarni Manu'' (the eighth Manu, the next) and Sani (the god of the [[Saturn (planet)|planet Saturn]]), and two daughters-Tapti and Vishti. Batara Surya also had a son, Rewanta, or Raiwata, from Ragyi. Interestingly, Surya's two sons – Sani and Yama – are responsible for judging humans' lives, after death. Sani gives the results of one's actions through one's life through appropriate punishments and rewards, while Yama gives the results of one's actions after death.

In the [[Ramayana]], Surya is mentioned as the father of King Sugriva, who helped Rama and Lakshmana in defeating King Ravana. He also trains Hanoman as his teacher. In the Mahabharata, Kunti receives a mantra from a sage, Durvasa; if spoken, he will be able to summon every god and bear children by him. Believing in the power of this spell, Kunti unwittingly has summoned Surya, but when Surya appears, she gets scared and demands him to return. However, Surya has an obligation to fulfill the spell before returning. Surya miraculously made Dewi Kunti to give birth to a child, while maintaining her virginity so that she, as an unmarried princess, would not have to face any shame or be the target of questions from society. Kunti feels compelled to leave behind her son, Karna, who grows up to be one of the central characters in the great war of [[Kurukshetra]].

====Worshiping Shiva ''Raditya'' in Bali====
[[File:Corinthian Capital with Sun God Surya Riding a Chariot (Quadriga) Gandhara 100-200 CE.jpg|thumb|[[Indo-Corinthian capital]] featuring Surya. Gandhara, 2nd century CE.]]
In the [[Puranas]] in [[Bali]], ''Batara Surya'' is the most intelligent student of Lord [[Shiva]], so that Lord Surya was given the title ''Surya Raditya'' and used as an example to find out the intelligence or supernatural power of Lord Shiva, and as a thank you from ''Bhatara Surya'', Lord Shiva was given an honorary title by the name of ''Bhatara Guru'', because he is the teacher of the Gods. There are others who argue, however, that in the transformation of the [[Purana]]s which is the interpretation of the ''maharsi'' on the Vedic chess book, it was ''Dewa Surya'' who later turned into [[Ludra]], who was finally called [[Shiva]], so that in worship chants it is often called the term ''Shiva Aditya''.

In the concept of ''Gama Bali'' there is a ''Pelinggih'' named ''Pelinggih Surya'' or ''Padmasana'', which is a place to worship Lord [[Shiva]] who manifests as ''Shiva Raditya'' or the sun god. In the ''Yayur Veda'' there are several special rituals for the Sulinggih who worship God in the morning in its manifestation as the ''Surya Batara'', namely those that come from ''Surya Sewana'' or ''Surya Namaskar'' which means worshiping the ''Surya Batara''. In the Panca Sembah mantra, there is also a special mantra aimed at ''Shiva Raditya''. According to the general view, Batara Surya is worshiped because he is a witness to life and he is the best student of Lord Shiva, so he was given the title ''Hyang Siwa Raditya'' ("Surya student of Lord Shiva"). The importance of ''Dewa Surya'' in Bali can be seen from the existence of ''Sanggah Surya'', which must always be present at every ''Yadnya'' ceremony in Bali. and this is poured in several Balinese literary manuscripts, one of which is the ''Bhama Kertih Lontar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dewa Surya |website=Gama Bali (gamabali.com) |url=https://gamabali.com/dewa-surya/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Prajapati ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|प्रजापति}}) is a compound of "praja" (creation, procreative powers) and "pati" (lord, master).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gonda]] (1982), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1062566 The Popular Prajāpati] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215195110/https://www.jstor.org/stable/1062566 |date=15 February 2020 }}, History of Religions, Vol. 22, No. 2 (Nov., 1982), University of Chicago Press, pp. 137-141&lt;/ref&gt; The term means "lord of creatures",&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2008p234"/&gt; or "lord of all born beings".&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p332"/&gt; In the later Vedic texts, Prajapati is a distinct Vedic deity, but whose significance diminishes.&lt;ref name="Williams2008p234"/&gt; Later, the term is synonymous with other gods, particularly Brahma.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p518"/&gt; Still later, the term evolves to mean any divine, semi-divine or human sages who create something new.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2008p234"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

==Origins==
[[File:An attempt to depict the creative activities of Prajapati.jpg|thumb|"An attempt to depict the creative activities of Prajapati", a steel engraving from the 1850s.]]
The origins of Prajapati are unclear. He appears late in the Vedic layer of texts, and the hymns that mention him provide different cosmological theories in different chapters.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p518"/&gt; He is missing from the [[Samhita]] layer of Vedic literature, conceived in the [[Brahmana]] layer, states [[Jan Gonda]].&lt;ref name="Gonda1986p2"/&gt; Prajapati is younger than [[Savitr]], and the word was originally an epithet for the sun.&lt;ref name=gonda130&gt;[[Jan Gonda]] (1982), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1062566 The Popular Prajāpati] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215195110/https://www.jstor.org/stable/1062566 |date=15 February 2020 }}, History of Religions, Vol. 22, No. 2 (Nov., 1982), University of Chicago Press, pp. 129-130&lt;/ref&gt; His profile gradually rises in the Vedas, peaking within the [[Brahmana]]s.&lt;ref name="Gonda1986p2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Gonda|title=Prajāpatiʼs rise to higher rank |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2OIUAAAAIAAJ |year=1986|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-07734-0|pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as Renou, Keith and Bhattacharji posit Prajapati originated as an abstract or semi-abstract deity in the later Vedic milieu as speculations evolved from the archaic to more learned speculations.&lt;ref name=gonda130/&gt;

===Indo-European===
A possible connection between Prajapati (and related figures in Indian tradition) and the [[Phanes|Prōtogonos]] ({{lang-grc|Πρωτογόνος}}, literally "first-born") of the Greek [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic tradition]] has been proposed:&lt;ref&gt;Martin West, ''Early Greek Philosophy and the Orient''. Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1971: 28-34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alsobrook20&gt;Kate Alsobrook (2008), "The Beginning of Time: Vedic and Orphic Theogonies and Poetics". M.A. Thesis, Reviewers: James Sickinger, Kathleen Erndl, John Marincola and Svetla Slaveva-Griffin, Florida State University, pages 20, 1-5, 24-25, 40-44&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
Protogonos is the [[Orpheus|Orphic]] equivalent of Vedic Prajapati in several ways: he is the first god born from a cosmic egg, he is the creator of the universe, and in the figure of [[Dionysus]]— a direct descendant of Protogonos—worshippers participate in his death and rebirth.

According to Robert Graves, the name of /PRA-JĀ[N]-pati/ ('progeny-potentate') is etymologically equivalent to that of the oracular god at [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]] (according to Makrobios&lt;ref&gt;Robert Graves : ''The Greek Myths''. 1955. vol. 1, p. 31, sec. 2.2&lt;/ref&gt;), namely /prōtogonos/.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The cosmic egg concept linked to Prajapati and Protogonos is common in many parts of the world, states David Leeming, which appears in later Orphic cult in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Adams Leeming|title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9I62BcuPxfYC |year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-174-9|pages=313–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==
Prajapati is described in many ways and inconsistently in Hindu texts, both in the Vedas and in the post-Vedic texts. These range from being the creator god to being same as one of the following: [[Brahma]], [[Agni]], [[Indra]], [[Vishvakarma]], [[Daksha]] and many others.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sukumari Bhattacharji |year= 2007 |title=The Indian Theogony |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lDc9AAAAIAAJ |publisher = Cambridge University Press|pages= 322–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vedas===
His role varies within the Vedic texts such as being one who created heaven and earth, all of water and beings, the chief, the father of gods, the creator of ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]]'' and ''[[asura]]s'', the cosmic egg and the [[Purusha]] (spirit).&lt;ref name="Williams2008p234"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p332"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D.

In the ''[[Rigveda]]'', Prajapati appears as an epithet for Savitr, Soma, Agni and Indra, who are all praised as equal, same and lord of creatures.&lt;ref name= Bhattacharji322&gt;{{cite book|author=Sukumari Bhattacharji |year= 2007 |title=The Indian Theogony |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lDc9AAAAIAAJ |publisher = Cambridge University Press|pages= 322–323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, in hymn 10.121 of the ''Rigveda'', is described ''Hiranyagarbha'' (golden embryo) that was born from the waters containing everything, which produced Prajapati. It then created ''manah'' (mind), ''kama'' (desire) and ''tapas'' (heat). However, this Prajapati is a metaphor, one of many [[Hindu cosmology]] theories, and there is no supreme deity in the ''Rigveda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gavin D.

In the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'', embedded inside the ''[[Yajurveda]]'', Prajapati emanated from Purusha (cosmic spirit) and Prajapati co-creates the world with the goddess of Language.&lt;ref name="WilkeMoebus2011p414"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annette Wilke|author2=Oliver Moebus|title=Sound and Communication: An Aesthetic Cultural History of Sanskrit Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wmYz_OtZ_gC |year=2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-024003-0|pages=414–416}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes the "golden cosmic egg" mythology, wherein Prajapati is stated to be born from a golden egg in primeval sea after the egg was incubated for a year. His sounds became the sky, the earth and the seasons. When he inhaled, he created the devas (gods), fire and light. When he exhaled, he created the asuras (demons) and darkness. Then, together with the goddess of Language, he created all beings and time.&lt;ref name="Leeming2010p144"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Adams Leeming|title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9I62BcuPxfYC |year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-174-9|pages=144–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 10 of the ''Shatapatha Brahmana'', as well as chapter 13 of ''Pancavimsa Brahmana'', is presented another theory wherein he (Prajapati) is a mother, becomes self-pregnant with all living creatures self-generated, then evil ''Mrtyu'' seizes these beings within his womb, but because these beings are part of the eternal Prajapati, they desire to live long like him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Gonda|title=Prajāpatiʼs rise to higher rank |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2OIUAAAAIAAJ |year= 1986|publisher= BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-07734-0|pages=5, 14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sukumari Bhattacharji |year= 2007 |title=The Indian Theogony |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lDc9AAAAIAAJ |publisher = Cambridge University Press|pages= 324–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Aitareya Brahmana'' offers a different myth, wherein Prajapati, having created the gods, metamorphosed into a stag and approached his daughter Dawn who was in the form of a doe, to produce other earthly beings. The gods were horrified by the incest, and joined forces to produce angry destructive [[Rudra]] to punish Prajapati for "doing what is not done". Prajapati was killed by Rudra.&lt;ref name="Leeming2010p144"/&gt; The ''Kausitaki Brahmana'' offers yet another myth, wherein Prajapati created from his own self fire, sun, moon, wind and feminine dawn. The first four saw dawn and released their seeds, which became existence (''Bhava'').&lt;ref name="Leeming2010p144"/&gt;

In section 2.266 of Jaiminiya Brahmana, Prajapati is presented as a spiritual teacher. His student [[Varuna]] lives with him for 100 years, studying the art and duties of being the "father-like king of gods".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Gonda|title=Prajāpatiʼs rise to higher rank |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2OIUAAAAIAAJ |year= 1986|publisher= BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-07734-0|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sukumari Bhattacharji |year= 2007 |title=The Indian Theogony |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lDc9AAAAIAAJ |publisher = Cambridge University Press|pages= 326–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upanishads===
Prajapati appears in early Upanishads, among the most influential texts in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2014), The Early Upanisads, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195352429}}, pages 3, 279-281; Quote: "Even though theoretically the whole of vedic corpus is accepted as revealed truth [shruti], in reality it is the Upanishads that have continued to influence the life and thought of the various religious traditions that we have come to call Hindu. Upanishads are the scriptures par excellence of Hinduism".&lt;/ref&gt; He is described in the Upanishads in diverse ways. For example, in different Upanishads, he is presented as the personification of creative power after Brahman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC|year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|pages=19–21, 205, 240, 350, 510, 544}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same as the wandering eternal soul,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC|year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|page=495}}&lt;/ref&gt; as symbolism for unmanifest obscure first born,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC|year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|pages=85, 96–97, 252}}&lt;/ref&gt; as manifest procreative sexual powers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC|year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|pages=53–56, 471, 534, 540}}&lt;/ref&gt; the knower particularly of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, self),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC|year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a spiritual teacher that is within each person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC|year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|pages=21, 106, 198–205, 263, 508, 544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus G.

{{Quote|
The self (atman) that is free from evils,
free from old age and death,
free from sorrow, free from hunger and thirst;
the self whose desires and intentions are real –
that is the self that you should try to discover,
that is the self that you should seek to perceive.
When someone discovers that self and perceives it,
he obtains all the worlds, and all his desires are fulfilled,
so said Prajapati.

===Post-Vedic texts===
In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', Brahma is declared to be a Prajapati who creates many males and females, and imbues them with desire and anger, the former to drive them into reproducing themselves and the latter to prevent them from being like gods.&lt;ref name="Leeming2010p144"/&gt; Other chapters of the epics and Puranas declare Shiva or Vishnu to be Prajapati.&lt;ref name= Bhattacharji322/&gt;

The ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' uses the epithet Prajapati to describe [[Krishna]], along with many other epithets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Winthrop Sargeant|editor=Christopher Key Chapple|title=The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COuy5CDAqt4C |year=2010|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-2840-6|pages=37, 167, 491 (verse 11.39)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grhyasutra]]s include Prajapati as among the deities invoked during wedding ceremonies and prayed to for blessings of prosperous progeny, and harmony between husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gonda]] (1982), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1062566 The Popular Prajāpati] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215195110/https://www.jstor.org/stable/1062566 |date=15 February 2020 }}, History of Religions, Vol. 22, No. 2 (Nov., 1982), University of Chicago Press, pp. 131-132&lt;/ref&gt;

Prajapati is identified with the personifications of Time, Fire, the Sun, etc. He is also identified with various mythical progenitors, especially (Manu Smrti 1.34) the ten lords of created beings first created by Brahmā: the Prajapatis Marichi, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Vasishtha, [[Prachetas]] or [[Daksha]], Bhrigu and Nārada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Mythology|last=Wilkins|first=W.J.|page=369|publisher=D.K.

In the [[Puranas]], there are groups of Prajapati called ''Prajapatayah'' who were [[rishi]]s (sages) or "grandfathers" from whom all of humanity resulted, followed by a Prajapatis list that widely varies in number and name between different texts.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2008p234"&gt;{{cite book|author=George M.

The ''Mahabharata'' and the genre of Puranas call various gods and sages as Prajapati. Some illustrations, states Roshen Dalal, include Agni, Bharata, Shashabindu, Shukra, Havirdhaman, Indra, Kapila, Kshupa, Prithu-Vainya, Soma, Svishtakrit, Tvashtr, Vishvakarma and Virana.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"/&gt;

In the medieval era texts of Hinduism, Prajapati refers to legendary agents of creation, working as gods or sages, who appear in every cycle of creation-maintenance-destruction (''manvantara''). Their numbers vary between seven, ten, sixteen or twenty-one.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p311"/&gt;

Their creative role varies. Pulaha, for example, is the mythical mind-born son of Brahma and a great rishi. As one of the Prajapatis, he helps create living wildlife such as lions, tigers, bears, wolves, as well as mythical beasts such as kimpurushas and shalabhas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title= Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chitragupta''' (Sanskrit: चित्रगुप्त, 'rich in secrets' or 'hidden picture') is a [[Hindu]] deity assigned with the task of keeping complete records of the actions of human beings and punishing or rewarding them according to their [[karma]]. Upon their death, Chitragupta has the task of deciding whether humans go to [[Svarga]] or [[Naraka]] (heaven or hell), depending on their actions on earth. Chitragupta is the seventeenth [[Manasputra|Manasaputra]] of [[Brahma]]. He is believed to have been created from Brahma's soul and mind (chit) and thus is allotted the right to write [[Vedas]] like a [[Brahmins|Brahmin]], and also assigned the duty of a [[Kshatriya]]. Chitragupta accompanies [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], the god of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://detechter.com/lord-chitragupta-who-helps-lord-yamaraj-to-maintain-karmic-accounts/|title=Lord Chitragupta - Who helps Lord Yamaraj to maintain karmic accounts|date=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
[[File:Yama's Court and Hell.jpg|right|210px|thumb|[[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]]'s court and hell. The blue figure is Yama with [[Yami]] and Chitragupta. 17th-century painting]]
* According to the [[Garuda Purana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hinduwebsite.com/sacredscripts/puranas/gp/gpu16.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; human souls, if not worthy of attaining [[moksha]], receive rewards and punishments according to their sins and virtues, and hence it is believed that good and bad deeds of men are not destroyed. The souls of men after death go to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Yamaloka]], which is presided over by the deities called [[Yamaduta]]s, who keep records of men's actions and accordingly give them their dues. The principal deity of Yamaloka is [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]] — the ruler of Yamaloka, and the king of laws.

[[File:Hindu hell.jpg|thumb|A large central panel portrays [[Yama]] the god of death (often referred to as Dharma) seated on a throne; to the left stands a demon. To the right of Yama sits Chitragupta, assigned with keeping detailed records of every human being and upon their death deciding how they are to be reincarnated, depending on their previous actions.]]
*The Yama Samhita, an extract from the 9th chapter of Ahilya Kamdhenu, a work of Hindu Law, says that Dharamaraja complained to Brahma about his difficulties in performing his most responsible duties of keeping records of the deeds of men and doing justice to them. Brahma went into meditation. Chitragupta sprang from his body and stood before him bearing an inkpot and a pen. The god Brahma (creator) said: "Because you are sprung from my body (kaya), therefore you shall be called [[Kayastha]] and as you existed in my body unseen I give you the name of Chitragupta. Let the Kshatriya dharma be followed by you and your progeny." He then assumed charge of Yamapuri. Yama setup marriage of his daughter Iravati with Chitragupta. [[Sraddhadeva Manu]], son of [[Lord Surya]], setup his daughter Nandini's marriage with Chitragupta.{{cn|date=November 2020}} Chitragupta had eight sons from the former and four from the latter and these twelve sons became the progenitors of the twelve subdivisions of the Chitraguptavansi Kayasthas, namely Saxena, Mathur, Gaur, Nigam, Ashthana, Kulshrestha, Suryadwaja, Bhatnagar, Ambastha, Shrivastava, Karna and Vaalmik.
*According to [[Padma Purana]], "Chitragupta was placed near Yama to register the good and evil actions of all sentient beings, that he was possessed of supernatural wisdom and became the partaker of sacrifices offered to the gods and fire. It is for this reason that the twice-born always give him oblations from their food. As he sprang from the body of Brahma he was called Kayastha of numerous gotras on the face of the earth."
*[[Bhavishya Purana]] states that God, the Creator, gave the name and duties of Chitragupta as follows: Because you have sprung from my body, therefore, you shall be called Kayastha and shall be famous in the world by the name of Chitragupta. Oh my son, let your residence be always in the region of the God of justice for the purpose of determining the merits and demerits of men.
*Vignana Tantra evokes the same verses as the Bhavishya Purana. 
*The same is the enjoinment of Brahma to Chitragupta according to Brihat Brahma Khanda. He was named Kayastha having sprung from the body (kaya) of Brahma. He was directed to perform all sanskars and to have writing as his profession.
*[[Garuda Purana]] describes the imperial throne of Chitragupta in Yamaloka holding his Court and dispensing justice according to the deeds of men and maintaining their record, in the following words: (There Dharmaraja, Chitragupta, Sravana and others see all sins and virtues remaining concealed in the bodies of men).
*[[The Mahabharata]] (Anusasana Parva, chapter 130) recites the teaching of Chitragupta requiring men to do virtuous and charitable acts and performing Yagya, saying that men are rewarded or punished according to their good or bad deeds.

==Legends==
Chitragupta came into being after Brahma, the creator, having established the four varnas — [[Brahmin]] (The Learned), [[Kshatriya]] (The Warriors), [[Vaishya]] (Merchant &amp; Farmers) and [[Shudra]] (Labourer) — ordained Yama to keep record of the deeds — good and evil — of all life-forms born and yet to be born on earth, in the heavens above and in the lands below. Yama, however, complained, "O Lord, how can I alone keep record of the deeds of the beings born into 84 lakh yonis (84,00,000 life-forms) in the three worlds"

Brahma went into meditation for 11,000 years and when he opened his eyes he saw a man holding pen and ink-pot in his hands and a sword girdled to his waist. Brahma spoke: {{quote|Thou hast been created from my body (Kaya), therefore shall thy progeny be known as the Kayasthas. Thou hast been conceived in my mind (Chitta or Chitra) and in secrecy (gupta), thy name shall also be Chitragupta. Let the role of a Kshatriya be followed by thee and thy progeny.}} Brahma then enjoined him to dispense justice and punish those who violated the dharma.

In the ''Garuda Purana'', Chitragupta is hailed as the "giver of letters" (''Chitragupta namastubhyam vedaksaradatre''). In the legends of Chitragupta as well as in the Vedas, he is referred to as the greatest king, while the rest are "Rajakas," or little kings.

{{Quote|चित्र इद राजा राजका इदन्यके यके सरस्वतीमनु।&lt;br&gt;पर्जन्य इव ततनद धि वर्ष्ट्या सहस्रमयुता ददत॥ &lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''Rig Veda'' Book 8/ Hymn 21/ Stanza 18)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHYnGde4BS4C&amp;pg=PA68|title = The Indo-Aryan Controversy: Evidence and Inference in Indian History|isbn = 9780700714636|last1 = Bryant|first1 = Edwin|last2 = Patton|first2 = Laurie L.|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The Rig Veda mentions an invocation to be made to Chitragupta before offering sacrifice. There is also a special invocation to Chitragupta as Dharmraj (Lord of Justice) to be made at the performance of shradh or other rituals. "Om tat purushaya vidmahe Chitragupta dhimahi tena lekha prachodayata."

Chitragupta is said to have been born in human form at [[Kayatha]] in [[Ujjain]], which is also an important archeological site with evidence of cultures dating back to more than 4000 years, with a temple dedicated to him.&lt;ref name="Dhavalikar &amp; Ansari"&gt;{{cite book|authors=MK Dhawalikar &amp; ZD Ansari|title=Excavations at Kayatha|year=1975|publisher=Lokasangraha Press|location=Pune|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barbarika''' (''Barbarīka)'' or '''Khatu Shyam''', is a [[Hindu god|Hindu deity]], particularly worshipped in western India. According to mahabharatha, he gave his head in donation to Lord Krishna 

According to the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'', Barbarika was the son of [[Ghatotkacha]] (Son of Bhima) and Princess [[Ahilawati|Maurvi]], daughter of Daitya Moora,&lt;ref name="Parmeshwaranand2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parmeshwaranand|first=Swami|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Puranas|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_6F0ZIBIL2ZAC|year=2001|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=978-81-7625-226-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_6F0ZIBIL2ZAC/page/n161 155]}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other references state that he was a warrior from the south. He is not a character who appears in the original Mahabharata, likely retroactively added to certain traditions through [[syncretism]]. Barbarika was originally a [[yaksha]], reborn as a man. He was bound by his principle of always fighting on the weaker side, which led him to stand witness to the [[Kurukshetra War|Kurukshetra war]] without taking part in it.

In [[Nepal]], Kirati king Yalambar, is believed to be the Barbarik of Mahabharata, son of Ghatotkach and grandson of Bheem. Barbarik had the dubious honor of being slain in the battle of the Mahabharata, in which gods and mortals fought alongside each other. Legend credits him with meeting Indra, the lord of heaven, who ventured into the Valley in human guise, while natives of the Kathmandu Valley portray him as [[Akash Bhairav]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/02-13/features2739.htm |title={title} |access-date=17 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225033948/http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/02-13/features2739.htm |archive-date=25 February 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rajasthan]], Barbarika is worshipped as '''Khatu Shyam''' in [[Khatu Shyam Temple]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=जानिये कौन हैं ये खाटू श्याम महाराज |url=https://www.newstrend.news/175965/khatu-shyam-maharaj-ki-kahani/ |website=newstrend.news |date=14 October 2018 |publisher=Newstrend |access-date=3 May 2020 |language=hi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Gujarat]], he is worshipped as '''Baliyadev''' and is believed to have been sacrificed before the Mahabharata war to ensure the victory of his grandfathers, the [[Pandavas]]. In return for his sacrifice, he was deified by [[Krishna]].

==Barbarika and his dialogue with Krishna==
Barbarika/ Belarsen was a grandson of [[Bhima]] (second of the [[Pandava]] brothers), and the son of Ghatotkacha. [[Ghatotkacha]] was the son of [[Bhima]] and [[Hidimbi]]. Even in his childhood, Barbarika was a very brave warrior. He learnt the art of warfare from his mother. The gods (''ashtadeva'') gave him the three infallible arrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMFdosx0PokC&amp;pg=PA431 |title=Rethinking India's Oral and Classical Epics |author=Alf Hiltebeitel |author-link=Alf Hiltebeitel |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780226340555 |page=431 |access-date=28 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305012600/https://books.google.ca/books?id=MMFdosx0PokC&amp;lpg=PA431 |archive-date=5 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Barbarika came to be known as "Bearer of Three Arrows".
When Barbarika learnt that the battle between the Pandavas and the Kauravas had become inevitable, he wanted to witness what was to be the Mahābhārata War. He promised his mother that if he felt the urge to participate in the battle, he would join the side that would be losing. He rode to the field on his blue horse, equipped with his three arrows and bow.

According to folklore, before the [[Kurukshetra War]] began,  [[Krishna]] asked all the warriors how many days it would take to finish the Mahabharata war alone. [[Bhishma]] answered that he would take 20 days to finish the war. [[Dronacharya]] replied that it would take him 25 days. When [[Karna]] was asked, he said he would take 24 days. [[Arjuna]] told Krishna it would take 28 days for him to complete the battle by himself. In this manner,  Krishna asked each warrior and received an answer.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Krishna, disguised as a Brahmin, stopped Barbarika to examine his strength. When asked how many days he would take to finish the war alone, Barbarika answered that he could finish it in one minute. Krishna then asked Barbarika how he would finish the great battle with just three arrows. Barbarika replied that a single arrow was enough to destroy all his opponents in the war, and it would then return to his quiver. He stated that the first arrow is used to mark all the things that he wants to destroy. If he uses the second arrow, then the second arrow will mark all the things that he wants to save. On using the third arrow, it will destroy all the things that are marked and then return to his quiver. In other words, with one arrow he can fix all his targets and with the other, he can destroy them.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Another version of the story goes thus, "Barbarika had come to Kurukshetra armed with just three arrows. ‘With one, I can destroy the Pandavas. With the other, the Kauravas. And with the third, Krishna,’ he said boastfully."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pattanaik|first=Devdutt|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/692288394|title=Jaya : an illustrated retelling of the Mahabharata|date=2010|isbn=978-0-14-310425-4|location=Gurgaon, Haryana, India|oclc=692288394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishna then challenged him to tie all the leaves of the [[Ficus religiosa|peepal]] tree under which he was standing, using his arrows. Barbarika accepted the challenge and started meditating to release his arrow by closing his eyes. As Barbarika started meditating, Krishna quietly plucked a leaf from the tree and hid it under his foot. When Barbarika released his first arrow, it marked all the leaves of the tree and finally started hovering around the leg of Krishna. Krishna asked Barbarika why the arrow was hovering over his foot. Barbarika replied that there must be a leaf under his foot and the arrow was targeting his foot to mark the leaf that was hidden underneath. Barbarika advised Krishna to lift his leg, since otherwise the arrow would mark the leaf by piercing Krishna's foot. Krishna then lifted his foot and the first arrow also marked the hidden leaf. The third arrow then collected all the leaves (including the hidden leaf ) and tied them together. By this, Krishna concluded that the arrows were so powerful and infallible, that even if Barbarika was unaware of the whereabouts of his targets, his arrows could still navigate and trace his intended targets. Thus, Krishna gets a deeper insight into Barbarika's phenomenal power.

Krishna then asked the boy whom he would favour in the war. Barbarika revealed that he intends to fight for the side whichever is weak. As the Pandavas had only seven [[Akshauhini]] armies compared to the eleven of the Kauravas, he considered that the Pandavas to be relatively the weaker side and hence wished to support them. But Krishna then asked him if he had seriously given a thought about the consequences, before giving such a word to his mother (about supporting the weaker side). Barbarika assumed that his support to the relatively weaker Pandava side would make them victorious. Krishna then revealed the actual consequences of his word to his mother:

Krishna says that whichever side he supports will end up making the other side weaker due to his power. Nobody would be able to defeat him. Hence, as he will be forced to switch sides to support the other side that has become weaker (due to his word to his mother). Thus, in an actual war, he would keep oscillating between the two sides, thereby destroying the entire army of both sides and eventually only he would remain. Subsequently, none of the sides would become victorious and he would be the lone survivor. Hence, Krishna avoids his participation in the war by seeking his head in charity.

Krishna then explained to him that before a battle, the head of the bravest Kshatriya needs to be sacrificed, in order to worship/sanctify the battlefield. Krishna said that he considered Barbarika to be the bravest among Kshatriyas, and was hence asking for his head in charity. In fulfillment of his promise, and in compliance with Krishna's command, Barbarika gave his head to him in charity. This happened on the 12th day of the Shukla Paksha (bright half) of the month of Phalgun on Tuesday. Barbarika was a Yaksha in his previous birth. Once  [[Brahma]] and several other Devas came to [[Vaikuntha]] and complained to  [[Vishnu]] that the [[Adharma]] on Earth was increasing; it was not possible for them to bear the tortures causes by the wicked people. Hence they came to seek the help of  Vishnu to check them.  Vishnu told the Devas that he will soon be incarnated on Earth as a human being and destroy all the evil forces. Then, a Yaksha told the Devas that he alone is enough to kill all evil elements on the Earth, and it was not necessary for  Vishnu to descend to Earth. This hurt  Brahma very much.  Brahma cursed this Yaksha that whenever the time comes to eliminate all the evil forces on Earth, then  Vishnu will first kill him. Later, the [[Yaksha]] takes birth as Barbarika and  Krishna seeks his head in charity as a result of this curse. Since that day Human Barbarika become the Khatu Shyam, The realizer of  Krishna by Barbarika given his head and God Krishna himself manifested in his heart.

==Bearing witness to the war==
Before decapitating himself, Barbarika told Krishna of his great desire to view the forthcoming battle and requested him to facilitate the same. Krishna agreed and placed the head on top of a hill overlooking the battlefield. From the hill, the head of Barbarika watched the entire battle.

At the end of the battle, the victorious Pandava brothers argued among themselves as to who was responsible for their victory. Krishna suggested that Barbarika's head, which had watched the whole battle should be allowed to judge. Barbarika's head suggested that it was Krishna alone who was responsible for the victory.
Barbarika replies, “All I could see was one thing, a divine chakra spinning all around the battlefield, killing all those who were not on the side of Dharma. Listening to this, [[Pandava]]s realized that it was  [[Narayana]] who actually eradicated the Adharma from the world, and the Pandavas were mere instruments. After the war, Barbarika's head was joined with his body and he left that place for narrating the whole world to maintain peace.

His other name is God Kamrunaag and is venerated as the preeminent deity in District Mandi, in Himachal Pradesh. A pond and a temple are situated in Kamru hill in Sundernagar, District Mandi. He witnessed the entire battle of Kurukshetra from the hill which is now known as [[Khatushyam Temple]], located in [[Khatu]] village in [[Sikar district|Sikar District]], [[Rajasthan]]. An impressive and especially sacred Temple of Baliyadev, Barbarik is situated at village [[Lambha]] in [[Ahmedabad District]], [[Gujarat]].

==Observances and festivals==

Barbarika is worshiped as Shyam, he is not the supreme personality of godhead Sri Krishna or any of Krishna's incarnation but may be considered as the great devotee of Krishna. And since the glories of Krishna's devotee is more than Krishna himself people worship Khatushyam also. Therefore, the flavour of the festivities reflects the playful and vibrant nature of Krishna. The festivals of [[Krishna Janmaashtami]], ''Jhool Jhulani Ekadashi'', [[Holi]] and [[Vasant Panchami]] are celebrated with gusto in the temple. The ''Phalguna Mela'' detailed below is the principal annual festival.

Lacs of devotees visits the temple every day. Newly married couples come to pay homage and newborn babies are brought to the temple for their ''mundan'' (the first hair-shaving) ceremony. An elaborate [[aarti]] is performed at the temple five times a day. These are:
* ''Mangala Aarti'': performed in the early morning, when the temple is open.
* ''Shringaar Aarti'': performed at the time of make-up of Baba Shyam. The idol is grandly ornamented for this aarti.
* ''Bhog Aarti'': performed at noon when ''bhog'' ([[Prasadam]]) is served to the .
* ''Sandhya Aarti'': performed in the evening, at sunset.
* ''Shayan Aarti'':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Team |first=Editorial |date=2022-08-04 |title=Baba Khatu Shyam {{!}} खाटू श्याम : कलयुग के देव |url=https://kalpanaye.in/khatu-shyam-mandir-information/ |access-date=2022-08-05 |website=Kalpanaye |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed in the night, at around 10 PM.

Two special hymns, the "Shri Shyam Aarti" and the "Shri Shyam Vinati," are chanted on all these occasions. The Shyam mantra is another litany of the 's names that is chanted by devotees.

Other particular observances include:

'''Shukla Ekadashi and Dwadashi:''' The 11th and 12th days of the bright half of every month in the Hindu calendar is of special significance to the temple. This is because Barbarika was born on the 11th day of the bright half of the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]], and he donated his head (''Sheesh'') to Krishna on the 12th day of the bright half of the month of Phalgun on Tuesday. ''Darshan'' on these two days is therefore considered auspicious and devotees come in their thousands every month. The temple remains open throughout the night that falls between these days. Night-long [[Bhajan]] sessions are organized since devotees traditionally pass the night in singing the praises of the . Devotees organize Bhajan programmes and invite Bhajan singers to sing devotional songs.

'''Bathing in the Shyam Kund:''' This is the holy pond near the temple from which the idol was retrieved. It is believed that a dip in this pond cures a person of ailments and brings good health. Filled with devotional fervour, people take ritual dips in the ''Shyam Kund.'' They believe that this will relieve them of diseases and contagion. Bathing during the annual [[Phalguna Mela in Khatushyamji|Phalguna Mela]] festival is deemed specially salutary.

'''Nishan Yatra:''' It is believed that your wishes are granted if you offer a ''Nishan'' at the temple. A ''Nishan'' is a triangular flag of a particular size, made of cloth, which is hoisted on a bamboo stick. It is carried in one's hands while covering the route from the town of Ringas to Khatu (17&amp;nbsp; km) on (bare) foot. ''Nishans'' are offered in millions during the ''Phalguna Mela.''

'''[[Phalguna Mela]]:''' The most important festival associated with the temple is the [[Phalguna Mela in Khatushyamji|Phalguna Mela]] which occurs just 8–9 days before the festival of [[Holi]]. Barbarika's head appeared on ''Phalguna Shuddha Ekadashi,'' the 11th day of the bright half of the Hindu month of [[Phalguna]]. Therefore, the fair is held from the 9th to the 12th of that month. The fair has now been extended to nearly 12–15 days of the bright half of the Phalguna month.

[[File: Khatushyamji Rath1.JPG|thumb|200px|Khatushyamji Rath idol during [[Padayatra|Pad Yatra]] from [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]] to Khatushyamji in 2008 ]]

On this holy occasion, pilgrims all over the country come here on foot with [[nishaan]]s (holy mark - [[flag]]s) in their hands. People enjoy their holy journey by singing ''[[Khatushyamji|shyam]] [[bhajan]]s'' and playing various musical instruments. They enjoy the journey by playing ''Holi'' with [[gulal]]. Many Shyam [[Bhakta]]s supply food to pedestrians in the shade of tents. They encourage also them to complete their journey with full enthusiasm. They enjoy this occasion as the marriage of Khatushyamji. People enjoy the [[mela]] by purchasing various things. On Dwadashi (= 12th day of a month), [[Bhog]] is being prepared as Baba's –[[Prasadi]] of [[Kheer]] Churama.

Special arrangements for security are made to control the crowd. Around 500,000 people visit in three days of this holy mela in this small village. To briefly see Baba Shyam's idol, very tight security is made with the help of [[bamboo]] fence around {{convert|2|km}}.

It is believed that the offerings made to Shyambaba is one of the highest collection made in India. There is also a new temple opened in Bengaluru, India.

[[File:Apollodotus bull with nandipada.jpg|thumb|Indian coin of [[Apollodotus I]], with a Nandipada [[Taurine cattle|taurine]] symbol on the hump of the [[zebu]] bull.]]
The ''Nandipada'' ("foot of  [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]]") is an ancient Indian symbol, also called a [[Taurine cattle|taurine]] symbol, representing a bull's [[hoof]] or the mark left by the foot of a bull in the ground. The nandipada and the zebu bull are generally associated with [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]], [[Shiva]] 's humped bull in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name ="Srinivasan"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vZheP9dIX9wC&amp;pg=PA224 Many Heads, Arms, and Eyes: Origin, Meaning, and Form of Multiplicity in Indian Art], Doris Srinivasan, BRILL, 1997, p.224&lt;/ref&gt; The Nandipada symbol also happens to be similar to the [[Brahmi]] letter "ma".

The Nandipada appears on numerous ancient Indian coins, such as coins from [[Taxila]] dating to the 2nd century BCE. The symbol also appears on the [[zebu]] bull on the reverse if often shown with a Nandipada taurine mark on its hump on the less worn coins, which reinforces the role of the animal as a symbol, religious or geographic, rather than just the depiction of an animal for decorative purposes. The same association was made later on coins of [[Zeionises]] or [[Vima Kadphises]].&lt;ref name ="Srinivasan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boppearachchi"&gt;Monnaies Greco-Bactriennes et Indo-Grecques, Bopearachchi, p.189&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Nandipada symbol saw later evolution, especially with branches becoming more decorated. The term is also often used in [[numismatics]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cngcoins.com/Coin.aspx?CoinID=127009 CNG Coins notice]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yama''' ({{lang-sa|यम}}), also known as '''Kala,''' and '''Dharmaraja''' is the Hindu god of death and [[justice]], responsible for the dispensation of [[ṛta|law]] and punishment of sinners in his abode, [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Yamapuri]].&lt;ref name=AncientYama&gt;{{cite web |title=Yama |url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Yama/ |website=[[World History Encyclopedia]] |access-date=9 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Shrinivasa M.|date=Jan 10, 2020|title=A temple for Yamaraj in Mandya district {{!}} Mysuru News|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/a-temple-for-yamaraj-in-mandya-district/articleshow/73181559.cms|access-date=2020-12-13|website=The Times of India|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is often identified with [[#Identification with Dharmadeva|Dharmadeva]], the personification of ''[[Dharma]]'', though the two deities have different origins and myths.&lt;ref name = "Dalal" &gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNmfdAKFpkQC&amp;q=Yama+Dharma|title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths|isbn=9780143415176|last1=Dalal|first1=Roshen|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kumar |first1=Venkat Sai Krishna |title=Yama |url=https://www.hindugods.in/gods/yama/ |website=Hindugods.in |access-date=9 January 2021 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Vedic]] tradition, Yama was considered to be the first mortal who died and espied the way to the celestial abodes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yama And Markandeya – Chapter – 1 "Introduction" – Wattpad |url=https://www.wattpad.com/339449859-yama-and-markandeya-chapter-1-introduction |website=www.wattpad.com |access-date=9 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus, as a result, he became the ruler of the departed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC&amp;pg=PA172|title=Vedic Mythology|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell|year=1995|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=172|isbn=978-8120811133}}&lt;/ref&gt; His role, characteristics, and abode have been expanded in texts such as the ''[[Upanishads]]'', the ''[[Ramayana]]'', the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and the ''[[Puranas]]''.

Yama is described as the twin of [[Yami]], and the son of the sun god [[Surya]] (in earlier traditions [[Vivasvat]]) and [[Sanjna]]. He judges the souls of the dead and depending on their deeds, he assigns them to the realm of the [[Pitris]] (forefathers), [[Naraka]] (hell), or be reborn on the earth. Yama is aided by the god [[Chitragupta]], who keeps a record of every deed done by a man, and chief attendants—Chanda and Kalapurusha. Yama is featured in many legends, including those of the [[Pandavas]], [[Savitri and Satyavan|Savitri Satyavan]], [[Nachiketa]] and [[Markandeya]].

Yama is also one of the [[Lokapala]]s (guardians of the realms), appointed as the protector of the south direction. He is often depicted as a dark-complexioned man, riding a buffalo and carrying a noose or mace to capture souls.&lt;ref name = "VM" &gt;{{Cite book |last=Mani |first=Vettam |url=https://archive.org/details/puranicencyclopa00maniuoft/page/369/mode/1up?view=theater|page=367 |title=Puranic encyclopaedia : a comprehensive dictionary with special reference to the epic and Puranic literature |date=1975 |publisher=Delhi : Motilal Banarsidass |others=Robarts - University of Toronto |isbn=978-0-8426-0822-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern culture, Yama has been depicted in various safety campaigns in India.

==Etymology and epithets==
The word "''Yama''" means 'twin' (Yama has a twin sister, [[Yami]]), and later came to mean 'binder' (derived from "''yam''"); the word also means  'moral rule or duty' (i.e. [[dharma]]), 'self-control', 'forbearance', and 'cessation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Danielou|first=Alain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OIXtDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=yama+god+of+justice+dharma&amp;pg=PA132|title=The Myths and Gods of India: The Classic Work on Hindu Polytheism|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3638-9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?tran_input=yama&amp;direct=se&amp;script=hk&amp;link=yes&amp;mode=3|title=Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit|website=spokensanskrit.org|access-date=2019-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Yama is also known by many other names, including ''Kala'' ('time'), ''Pashi'' (one who carries a noose') and ''Dharmaraja'' ('lord of [[Dharma]]').&lt;ref name = "Dalal" /&gt;
===Identification with Dharmadeva===
Yama and Dharmadeva, the god personifying the concept of [[Dharma]], are generally considered to be one and the same person.&lt;ref name="Mani"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mani |first=Vettam |url=https://archive.org/details/puranicencyclopa00maniuoft/page/224/mode/1up?view=theater |title=Puranic encyclopaedia : a comprehensive dictionary with special reference to the epic and Puranic literature |date=1975 |publisher=Delhi : Motilal Banarsidass |others=Robarts - University of Toronto |isbn=978-0-8426-0822-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Dalal" /&gt; Author [[Vettam Mani]] speculates a reason for this identification: {{quote|"[[Vyasa]] has used as synonyms for Dharmadeva in the Mahabharata the words Dharmaraja, Vṛsa and Yama. Now among the synonyms for the two there are two words in common- Dharmaraja and Yama. This has led to this misunderstanding. Because Kala weighs the evil and good in man he got the name Dharmaraja. Dharmadeva got that name because he is the incarnation of Dharma. The real name of Kāla is Yama. Dharmadeva got the name Yama because he possesses 'Yama' (control of the self for moral conduct)."|[[Vettam Mani]]}}

Mani believes that Yama and Dharmadeva are two different deities, citing that the Puranic scriptures attest different myths about the deities — 
* Yama is the judge of the dead, while Dharmadeva is one of the ''[[Prajapatis]]'' (agents of creation).&lt;ref name = "Mani /&gt;
* Yama is the son of sun god [[Surya]] and his wife [[Sanjna]], while Dharmadeva is born from the chest of the god [[Brahma]].&lt;ref name = "Mani" /&gt;
* Yama is married to Dhumorna.&lt;ref name = "VM" /&gt; On the other hand, Dharmadeva is married to ten or thirteen [[Daksha#Daughters|daughters]] of [[Daksha]].&lt;ref name = "Mani" /&gt;
* Yama has a daughter Sunita.&lt;ref name = "VM /&gt; Dharmadeva fathered many sons from his wives. He also fathered [[Yudhishthira]], the eldest of the [[Pandavas]].&lt;ref name = "Mani" /&gt;

In the [[Rigveda]], Yama is the son of a solar deity [[Vivasvat]] and [[Saranyu|Saraṇyū]] and has a twin sister named Yamī.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Macdonell|first=Arthur Anthony|title=Vedic Mythology|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1897|pages=171–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rao|1914|loc=vol. 2, p. 525}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is cognate to the [[Avesta]]n Yima, son of Vīvanhvant. The majority of Yama's appearances are in the first and tenth book. Yama is closely associated with [[Agni]] in the Rigveda. Agni is both Yama's friend and priest, and Yama is stated to have found the hiding Agni. In the Rigveda, Yama is the king of the dead, and one of the two kings that humans see when they reach heaven (the other being [[Varuna]]). Yama is stated to be a gatherer of the people, who gave dead people a place to rest. Out of the three Rigvedic heavens, the third and highest belong to Yama (the lower two belong to [[Savitr]]). Here is where the gods resides, and Yama is surrounded by music. In the ritual sacrifice, Yama is offered [[Soma (drink)|soma]] and [[ghee]], and is invoked to sit at the sacrifice, lead the sacrificers to the abode of the gods, and provide long life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the dialogue hymn between Yama and Yamī (RV 10.10), as the first two humans, Yamī tries to convince her twin brother Yama to have sex with her. Yamī makes a variety of arguments, including continuing the mortal line, that [[Tvastar|Tvashtar]] created them as a couple in the womb, and that [[Dyaus]]h and [[Prithvi]] are famous for their incest. Yama argues that their ancestors, "the Gandharva in the waters and the watery maiden," as a reason not to commit incest, that [[Mitra (Hindu god)|Mitra]]-[[Varuna]] are strict in their ordinances, and that they have spies everywhere. By the end of the hymn, Yamī becomes frustrated but Yama remains firm in his stance. However, by RV 10.13.4, Yama is stated to have chosen to leave offspring, but Yamī is not mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Jamison|first1=Stephanie|title=The Rigveda: The Earliest Religious Poetry of India|last2=Brereton|first2=Joel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780199370184|pages=1381–1383, 1389–1390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Vedic literature states that Yama is the first mortal, and that he chose to die, and then proceeded to create a path to the "other world", where deceased ancestral fathers reside. Due to being the first man to die, he is considered the chief of the dead, lord of settlers, and a father. Throughout the course of Vedic literature, Yama becomes more and more associated with the negative aspects of death and eventually becomes the god of death. He also becomes associated with Antaka (the Ender), Mṛtyu (Death), Nirṛti (Decease), and Sleep.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Yama has two four-eyed, broad nosed, brindled, reddish-brown dogs, and are the sons of [[Sarama|Saramā]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Sfn|Jamison|Brereton|2014|p=1392}} However, in the Atharvaveda, one of dogs is brindled and the other is dark. The dogs are meant to track down those who are about to die, and guard the path to Yama's realm. Scholars who adhere to [[Theodor Aufrecht|Theodor Aufrecht's]] interpretation of RV 7.55 state that the dogs were also meant to keep wicked men out of heaven.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Yajurveda#Shukla Yajurveda|Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā]] (the White Yajurveda) states Yama and his twin sister Yamī both reside in the highest heaven.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Atharvaveda states Yama is unsurpassable and is greater than Vivasvat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Taittirīya Aranyaka and the [[Āpastamba|Āpastamba Śrauta]] state that Yama has golden-eyed and iron-hoofed horses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Upanishads ====
In the [[Katha Upanishad]], Yama is portrayed as a teacher to the [[Brahmin]] boy [[Nachiketa]].&lt;ref name=YamaGod /&gt; Having granted three boons to Nachiketa, their conversation evolves to a discussion of the nature of being, knowledge, the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (i.e. the soul, self) and [[moksha]] (liberation).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pp. 269–273&lt;/ref&gt; From the translation by Brahmrishi Vishvatma Bawra:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vuloQgAACAAJ&amp;q=Brahmrishi+Vishvatma+Bawra+katha|title=The Eternal Soul: Commentary on the Katha Upanishad|last1=Bawra|first1=Brahmrishi Vishvatma|last2=Milcetich|first2=William F.|date=2009|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=978-1448607174|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|Yama says: I know the knowledge that leads to heaven. I will explain it to you so that you will understand it.

=== Mahabharata ===
[[File:Savitri, Satyavan &amp; Yama by M. V. Dhurandhar 1924.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|A depiction of Yama and Savitri from the Vana Parva,.|alt=]]
In the epic [[Mahabharata]], Dharmadeva (who is identified with Yama) is the father of [[Yudhishthira]], the oldest brother of the five [[Pandavas]].&lt;ref name= Mani /&gt; Yama most notably appears in person in the  ''Yaksha Prashna'' and the ''Vana Parva,'' and is mentioned in the ''Bhagavad Gita''.&lt;ref name=YamaGod /&gt;

==== Yaksha Prashna ====
In the [[Yaksha Prashna]], Dharmadeva (Yama) appears as a [[yaksha]] (nature spirit) in the form of a Crane to question Yudhishthira and test his righteousness. Impressed by Yudhishthira's strict adherence to [[dharma]] and his answers to the riddles posed, Yama revealed himself as his father, blessed him, and brought his younger Pandava brothers back to life. From the Yaksha Prashna article linked:

{{blockquote|The Yaksha [Yama] asked, "What enemy is invincible? What constitutes an incurable disease? What sort of man is noble and what sort is ignoble"? And Yudhishthira responded, "Anger is the invincible enemy. Covetousness constitutes a disease that is incurable. He is noble who desires the well-being of all creatures, and he is ignoble who is without mercy".}}

==== Vana Parva ====
In the [[Vana Parva]], when Yudhishthira asks the sage [[Markandeya]] whether there has ever been a woman whose devotion matched [[Draupadi|Draupadi's]], the sage replied by relating the story of [[Savitri and Satyavan]].&lt;ref name=YamaGod /&gt; After Savitri's husband Satyavan died, Yama arrived to carry away his soul.&lt;ref name=YamaGod /&gt; However, Yama was so impressed with Savitri's purity and dedication to dharma and to her husband, he was convinced to instead bring Satyavan back to life.&lt;ref name=YamaGod /&gt;

;Tirtha-Yatra Parva
In the Tirtha-yatra Parva (Book 3, Varna Parva, CXLII), Lomasa tells Yudhishthira 'in days of yore, there was (once) a terrible time in the [[Satya Yuga]] when the eternal and primeval Deity [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Krishna]]] assumed the duties of Yama. And, O thou that never fallest off, when the God of gods began to perform the functions of Yama, there died not a creature while the births were as usual.'

This led to an increase in the population and the Earth sinking down 'for a hundred yojanas. And suffering pain in all her limbs.' The earth sought the protection of [[Narayana]], who incarnated as a boar ([[Varaha]]) and lifted her back up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/TheMahabharataMNDutt|title=Mahabharata|last=M.N.Dutt|pages=[https://archive.org/details/TheMahabharataMNDutt/page/n209 206]–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Udyoga Parva ====
In the [[Udyoga Parva]], it is stated that the wife of Yama is called Urmila.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m05/m05117.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 5: Udyoga Parva: Bhagwat Yana Parva: Section CXVII|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2019-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bhagavad Gita ====
In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], part of the Mahabharata, Krishna states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSA3hsIq5dsC&amp;q=bhagavad+gita+as+it+is|title=Bhagavad-gita As It Is|last=Prabhupada|first=His Divine Grace A.

=== Puranas ===
Yama and his abode are frequently mentioned in the [[Puranas]].

==== Bhagavata Purana / Srimad Bhagavatam ====
===== Third and Fourth Canto =====
[[File:Vidura and Dhritarashtra.jpg|thumb|Vidura attempts to convince King Dhritarashtra to reconcile with the Pandavas.|alt=|210x210px|left]]In the third and fourth cantos of the [[Bhagavata Purana|Srimad Bhagavatam]], Yama was incarnated as a [[shudra]] called [[Vidura]] due to being cursed by a sage for being too harsh in his punishments. From the [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] / [[Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]] (BBT) translation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BYVOCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=srimad+bhagavatam|title=Srimad-Bhagavatam, Third Canto: The Status Quo|last=Prabhupada|first=His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami|date=1972|publisher=The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust|isbn=978-9171496362|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|As long as Vidura played the part of a śūdra, being cursed by Maṇḍūka Muni [also known as [[Mandavya|Māṇḍavya]] Muni], [[Aryaman|Aryamā]] officiated at the post of Yamarāja to punish those who committed sinful acts.|source=Canto 1, Chapter 13, Verse 15}}

Vidura, a devotee of [[Krishna]], is the main protagonist in the third canto. In this [[canto]], after being thrown out of his home by King [[Dhritarashtra]] (his older half-brother) for admonishing the [[Kaurava|Kaurava's]] ignoble behaviour towards the [[Pandava]]s, Vidura went on a [[pilgrimage]] where he met other devotees of Krishna such as [[Uddhava]] and the sage [[Maitreya (Mahābhārata)|Maitreya]], the latter of whom revealed Vidura's true origin to him:

{{Blockquote|I know that you are now Vidura due to the cursing of Māṇḍavya [[Muni (Saint)|Muni]] and that formerly you were King Yamarāja, the great controller of living entities after their death. You were begotten by the son of [[Satyavati|Satyavatī]], [[Vyasa|Vyāsadeva]], in the kept wife of his brother.|source=Canto 3, Chapter 5, Verse 20}}

Krishna also states Yama punishes sinners, as relayed to Vidura (again, an incarnation of Yama) by Maitreya during their conversation about the origin and creation of the [[Hindu cosmology|multiverse]]:

{{Blockquote|The [[Brahmin|brahmanas]], the cows and the defenceless creatures are My [Krishna's] own body. Those whose faculty of judgement has been impaired by their own sin look upon those as distinct from Me. They are just like furious serpents, and they are angrily torn apart by the bills of the vulturelike messengers of Yamaraja, the superintendent of sinful persons.|source=Canto 3, Chapter 16, Verse 10}}

A detailed account of the punishment of a sinner upon their death is also provided, beginning with their seizure and journey to Yamaloka ([[Hell|i.e. Hell]]):

{{Blockquote|As a criminal is arrested for punishment by the constables of the state, a personal engaged in criminal sense gratification is similarly arrested by the Yamadutas, who bind him by the neck with a strong rope and cover his subtle body so that he may undergo severe punishment. While carried by the constables of Yamaraja, he is overwhelmed and trembles in their hands. While passing on the road [to Yamaloka] he is bitten by dogs, and he can remember the sinful activities of his life. He is thus terribly distressed.|source=Canto 3, Chapter 30, Verses 20–21}}

===== Sixth Canto =====
In the sixth canto, Yama (not as [[Vidura]] nor with [[Aryaman|Aryama]] in the post; see third and fourth canto) instructs his messengers, the ''Yamadutas'', when questioned about who has supreme authority in the universe since there are so many gods and demigods:

{{blockquote|Yamarāja said: My dear servants, you have accepted me as the Supreme, but factually I am not. Above me, and above all the other demigods, including Indra and Candra, is the one supreme master and controller. The partial manifestations of His personality are Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva, who are in charge of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this universe. He is like the two threads that form the length and breadth of a woven cloth. The entire world is controlled by Him just as a bull is controlled by a rope in its nose.|source=Canto 6, Chapter 3, Verse 12&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/6/3/12/|title=ŚB 6.3.12|website=vedabase.io|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===== Tenth Canto =====
In the tenth canto, [[Krishna]] and [[Balarama]] travel to Yama's abode to bring back the dead son of their Guru, [[Sandipani|Sandipani Muni]]:

{{blockquote|&lt;poem&gt;Lord Janārdana took the conchshell that had grown around the demon’s body and went back to the chariot. Then He proceeded to Saṁyamanī, the beloved capital of Yamarāja, the lord of death. Upon arriving there with Lord Balarāma, He loudly blew His conchshell, and Yamarāja, who keeps the conditioned souls in check, came as soon as he heard the resounding vibration. Yamarāja elaborately worshiped the two Lords with great devotion, and then he addressed Lord Kṛṣṇa, who lives in everyone’s heart: “O Supreme Lord Viṣṇu, what shall I do for You and Lord Balarāma, who are playing the part of ordinary humans?”

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Suffering the bondage of his past activity, My spiritual master’s son was brought here to you. O great King, obey My command and bring this boy to Me without delay.

Yamarāja said, “So be it,” and brought forth the guru’s son. Then those two most exalted Yadus presented the boy to Their spiritual master and said to him, “Please select another boon.”&lt;/poem&gt;|source=Canto 10, Chapter 45, Verses 42–46&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/10/45/|title=Chapter Forty-five |website=vedabase.io|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Marriage and children===
Varying information about Yama's consorts and children are found in Hindu texts.

Purāṇic encyclopaedia with special reference to the Epic and Purāṇic Literature.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Brahma Purana'', the name of Yama's eldest daughter is Sunita, who is the mother of the king Vena.

In the Mahabharata, [[Yudhishthira]], the eldest Pandava, was blessed by Dharma to [[Kunti]].&lt;ref name=YamaGod /&gt;

== In popular culture ==
In addition to his depiction in movie and television adaptations of scriptures such as in the television series, Yama has also been depicted in road safety campaigns in India, particularly to warn against the dangers of riding motorcycles without helmets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/india/bengaluru-traffic-police-deploys-yamaraja-on-streets-to-warn-people-against-violations-spread-road-safety-awareness-4715071.html|title=Bengaluru Traffic Police deploys 'Yamaraja' on streets to warn people about violations, spread road safety awareness|website=Firstpost|date=11 July 2018|access-date=2019-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planet==
''Shani'' as a planet appears in various Hindu astronomical texts in [[Sanskrit]], such as the 5th-century ''Aryabhatiya'' by [[Aryabhatta]], the 6th-century ''Romaka'' by Latadeva and ''Pancha Siddhantika'' by Varahamihira, the 7th-century ''Khandakhadyaka'' by Brahmagupta and the 8th-century ''Sisyadhivrddida'' by Lalla.&lt;ref name="Burgess1989vii"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ebenezer|last=Burgess|editor=P Ganguly, P Sengupta|title=Sûrya-Siddhânta: A Text-book of Hindu Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0Uo_-_iizwC|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprint), Original: Yale University Press, American Oriental Society|isbn=978-81-208-0612-2|pages=vii–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aryabhatta|author2=H.

The manuscripts of these texts exist in slightly different versions, present Shani's motion in the skies, but vary in their data, suggesting that the text were open and revised over their lives. The texts slightly disagree in their data, in their measurements of Shani's revolutions, apogee, epicycles, nodal longitudes, orbital inclination, and other parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ebenezer|last=Burgess|editor=P Ganguly, P Sengupta|title=Sûrya-Siddhânta: A Text-book of Hindu Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0Uo_-_iizwC|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprint), Original: Yale University Press, American Oriental Society|isbn=978-81-208-0612-2|pages=ix-xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, both ''Khandakhadyaka'' and ''Surya Siddhanta'' of Varaha state that Shani completes 146,564 revolutions on its own axis every 4,320,000 earth years, an Epicycle of Apsis as 60 degrees, and had an apogee (aphelia) of 240 degrees in 499 CE; while another manuscript of ''Soorya Siddhantha'' revises the revolutions to 146,568, the apogee to 236 degrees and 37 seconds and the Epicycle to about 49 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ebenezer|last=Burgess|editor=P Ganguly, P Sengupta|title=Soorya-Siddhânta: A Text-book of Hindu Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0Uo_-_iizwC|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Edited and Reprinted), Original: Yale University Press, American Oriental Society|isbn=978-81-208-0612-2|pages=ix-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st-millennium-CE Hindu scholars had estimated the time it took for sidereal revolutions of each planet including Shani, from their astronomical studies, with slightly different results:&lt;ref name="Burgess198926"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ebenezer|last=Burgess|editor=P Ganguly, P Sengupta|title=Soorya-Siddhânta: A Text-book of Hindu Astronomy|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W0Uo_-_iizwC|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprint), Original: Yale University Press, American Oriental Society|isbn=978-81-208-0612-2|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shani is depicted wearing blue or black robes, having dark complexion and riding a vulture or on an iron chariot drawn by eight horses. He holds in his hands a bow, an arrow, an axe and a trident. He is canonically represented riding on a large crow which follows him wherever he goes. Some astrologers believe he has more than one mount such as a horse, elephant, donkey, lion, dog, jackal, deer and vulture, although this is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=M.

Shani is believed to be the incarnation of [[Krishna]] according to [[Brahma Vaivarta Purana]] where Krishna said that he is "Shani among planets". He is also called ''Saneeswar'' meaning "Lord of Saturn" and is designated the task of granting the fruits of one's action, thus becoming the most feared amongst Hindu astrological gods. He is often the most misunderstood deity in the Hindu Pantheon as he is said to cause persistent chaos in one's life, and is known to be milder if worshipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Mohan|first=Lavanya|date=2016-01-30|title=Shani's law|language=en-IN|work=The Hindu|url=https://www.thehindu.com/thread/arts-culture-society/article8168976.ece|access-date=2021-03-07|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shani Dev – Know Everything About him|url=https://www.mantraquest.com/shani-dev.html|access-date=2021-03-09|website=MantraQuest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shani is the root for name for the day Saturday in many other Indian languages. In modern [[Hindi]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Urdu]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], Saturday is called ''Shanivaar''; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: ''Sani kizhamai''; [[Malayalam]]: ''Shaniyazhcha''; [[Thai solar calendar#Weeks|Thai]]: ''Wạn s̄eār̒'' (วันเสาร์).

Shani is part of the [[Navagraha]] in Hindu zodiac system, considered malefic, associated with spiritual asceticism, penance, discipline and conscientious work. The role and importance of the Navagraha developed over time with various influences. Deifying planetary bodies and their astrological significance occurred as early as the [[Vedic period]] and was recorded in the [[Vedas]]. The earliest work of astrology recorded in India is the [[Vedanga Jyotisha]] which began to be compiled in the 14th century BCE. It was possibly based on works from the Indus Valley Civilization as well as various foreign influences. [[Babylonian astrology]] which was the first astrology and calendar to develop, and was adopted by multiple civilizations including India. The [[classical planet]]s, including Saturn.

The Navagraha developed from early works of astrology over time. Saturn and various [[classical planet]]s were referenced in the [[Atharvaveda]] around 1000 BCE. The Navagraha was furthered by additional contributions from [[Western Asia]], including [[Zoroastrian calendar|Zoroastrian]] and [[Hellenistic astrology|Hellenistic]] influences. The [[Yavanajataka]], or 'Science of the [[Yavana]]s', was written by the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greek]] named "[[Yavanesvara]]" ("Lord of the Greeks") under the rule of the [[Western Kshatrapa]] king [[Rudrakarman I]]. The Yavanajataka written in 120 CE is often attributed to standardizing Indian astrology. The Navagraha would further develop and culminate in the [[Shaka era]] with the [[Saka]] or Scythian, people. Additionally the contributions by the Saka people would be the basis of the [[Indian national calendar]], which is also called the Saka calendar.

The [[Hindu calendar]] is a [[Lunisolar calendar]] which records both lunar and solar cycles. Like the Navagraha, it was developed with the successive contributions of various works.

Planet ''Shani'' rules over both zodiac signs, [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] and [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]], two of the twelve constellations in the zodiac system of Hindu astrology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Backlund|first=Roya|title=Every Zodiac Sign Has A Ruling Planet &amp; This Is Yours|url=https://www.elitedaily.com/p/every-zodiac-sign-has-a-ruling-planet-this-is-yours-9049398|access-date=2021-01-14|website=Elite Daily|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''Shani'' rules over your zodiac sign, it is said you must wear a ring with a stone made of [[Sapphire|Blue Sapphire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lucky Stone by Date of Birth - Times of India|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/astrology/gemstones/lucky-stone-by-date-of-birth/articleshow/68204969.cms|access-date=2021-01-04|website=The Times of India|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deity==

==Planet==
Budha as a planet appears in various Hindu astronomical texts in [[Sanskrit]], such as the 5th century ''Aryabhatiya'' by [[Aryabhatta]], the 6th century ''Romaka'' by Latadeva and ''Panca Siddhantika'' by Varahamihira, the 7th century ''Khandakhadyaka'' by [[Brahmagupta]], and the 8th century ''Sisyadhivrddida'' by Lalla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chatterjee |first=Bina |year=1970 |title=The Khandakhadyaka (an astronomical treatise) of Brahmagupta, with the commentary of Bhattotpala |pages=59–64 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |oclc=463213346 |lang=Sanskrit |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKOtRmgr1nkC |via=Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burgess1989/&gt;{{rp|pages=vii–xi}} These texts present Budha as one of the planets and estimate the characteristics of the respective planetary motion.&lt;ref name=Burgess1989/&gt;{{rp|pages=vii–xi}} Other texts such as ''Surya Siddhanta'' dated to have been complete sometime between the 5th&amp;nbsp;century and 10th&amp;nbsp;century present their chapters on various planets with deity mythologies.&lt;ref name=Burgess1989/&gt;{{rp|pages=vii–xi}}

The manuscripts of these texts exist in slightly different versions, present Budha's motion in the skies, but vary in their data, suggesting that the text were open and revised over their lives. The texts slightly disagree in their data, in their measurements of Budha's revolutions, apogee, epicycles, nodal longitudes, orbital inclination, and other parameters.&lt;ref name=Burgess1989/&gt;{{rp|pages=ix-xi}} For example, both ''Khandakhadyaka'' and ''Surya Siddhanta'' of Varaha state that Budha completes 17,937,000 revolutions on its own axis every 4,320,000 years, and had an apogee (aphelia) of 220 degrees in 499 CE; while another manuscript of ''Surya Siddhanta'' increases the revolutions by 60 to 17,937,060, and the apogee to 220 degrees and 26 seconds.&lt;ref name=Burgess1989/&gt;{{rp|pages=ix-x}}

The 1st millennium CE Hindu scholars had estimated the time it took for sidereal revolutions of each planet including Budha, from their astronomical studies, with slightly different results:&lt;ref name=Burgess1989/&gt;{{rp|pages=26-27}}

==Legends==
Budha appears as a deity in Indian texts, often as the son of [[Soma (deity)|Soma]] (a moon god, alternatively known as [[Chandra]]) and [[Taraka (goddess)|Tara]] (wife of [[Bṛhaspati]], the god of Jupiter). He is described as the son of goddess [[Rohini (goddess)|Rohini]] (a daughter of [[Daksha]]) and the god [[Chandra]].&lt;ref name=Mahoney2013/&gt; Budha had only one offspring, King [[Pururavas]], by his spouse [[Ila (Hinduism)|Ila]].

One of the earliest mentions of ''Budha'' as a celestial body appears in the [[Vedas|Vedic text]] ''[[Pancavimsa Brahmana]]'', and it appears in other ancient texts such as the [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] as well, but not in the context of astrology. In the [[Vedas]], Budha is linked to three steps of the Hindu god [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name=Mahoney2013&gt;{{cite book |last=Mahoney |first=Terry |title=Mercury |year=2013 |publisher=Springer Science |isbn=978-1-4614-7951-2 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iC65BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calendar and Hindu astrology==
Budha is the root of the word 'Budhavara' or [[Wednesday]] in the Hindu calendar.&lt;ref name=Dalal2010/&gt; The word "Wednesday" in the Greco-Roman and other Indo-European calendars is also dedicated to planet Mercury ("day of Woden or Oden"). 

Budha is part of the [[Navagraha]] in Hindu zodiac system, considered benevolent, associated with an agile mind and memory. The role and importance of the Navagraha developed over time with various influences. Deifying planetary bodies and their astrological significance occurred as early as the [[Vedic period]] and was recorded in the [[Vedas]]. The earliest work of astrology recorded in India is the [[Vedanga Jyotisha]] which began to be compiled in the 14th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BCE. The [[Classical planet|classical planets]], including Mercury, were referenced in the [[Atharvaveda]] around 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE.

The Navagraha was furthered by additional contributions from [[Western Asia]], including [[Zoroastrian calendar|Zoroastrian]] and [[Hellenistic astrology|Hellenistic]] influences. The ''[[Yavanajataka]]'', or ''Science of the [[Yavana|Yavanas]]'', was written by the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greek]] named "[[Yavanesvara]]" ("Lord of the Greeks") under the rule of the [[Western Kshatrapa]] king [[Rudrakarman I]]. The Yavanajataka written in 120&amp;nbsp;CE is often attributed to standardizing Indian astrology. The Navagraha would further develop and culminate in the [[Shaka era]] with the [[Saka]], or Scythian, people. Additionally the contributions by the Saka people would be the basis of the [[Indian national calendar]], which is also called the Saka calendar.

Budha is also the root for name for the week day in many other Indian languages. In modern [[Hindi]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Urdu]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], Wednesday is called ''Budhavara''; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: ''Budhan kizhamai''; [[Malayalam]]: ''Budhanazhcha''; [[Thai solar calendar#Weeks|Thai]]: ''Wan Phut'' ({{lang|th|วันพุธ}}).{{cn|date=August 2016}}

==Iconography==
[[File:Planet budha.JPG|right|thumb|upright=0.8|Budha as depicted on a mural in [[Jawahar Kala Kendra]], [[Jaipur]]]]
Budha's iconography, according to Roshen Dalal, is as a benevolent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lochtefeld |first=James G. |year=2002 |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism |volume=A-M |page=[https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000loch/page/n396 324] |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-8239-3179-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000loch |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a minor male deity with light yellow colored (or green) body, draped into yellow clothes,  holding a scimitar, a club, and a shield. He is canonically represented riding a chariot made of air and fire, drawn by eight wind horses; but in some illustrations, he rides a lion and has four arms, and in [[Swetharanyeswarar Temple|Bhudhan Temple]] he is depicted riding a winged lion.&lt;ref name=Dalal2010/&gt;

Budha has been linguistically related to  ''[[Gautama_Buddha|Buddha]]'', the founder of [[Buddhism]], though this is controversial &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/mw/b.html |title=[no title cited] |publisher=University of Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gray |first=Patrick |year=2015 |title=Varieties of Religious Invention: Founders and their functions in history |page=46, footnote&amp;nbsp;[19] |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-935972-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oHM_CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The deity of Chakrakot amandala comprising present days Kalahandi, Koraput and Bastar was Manikya debi or Manikeswari around 10th century A.D. 

Later on the [[Kalahandi State|king of Kalahandi]] Harichandra Deo struggled and died because of which his pregnant queen left for her father’s house in Gadapur, Phulbani. Some part of Phulbani was part of [[Koraput district|Mahakantara]] in ancient times. Though capital of Chakrakotamandala is still being debated, it is clear that it has many similar with Kamala Mandala, another ancient name of Kalahandi, Manikya Devi came to Gadapur perhaps due to influence of Chakrakota Mandala. Later, the queen and her son, Ramchandra Deo returned with  Manikya Debi or Manikeswari as per Kalahandi’s public request that time. Manikeswari was brought from Gadapur (Phulbani) around 1200 A.D. and it was located in Kalahandi. Manikeswari was also popularized by Suryabansi Gajapati in 15th-16th century in [[Puri District|Puri]] region. [[Purushottama Deva]] Gajapati considered Manikeswari as consort of [[Lord Jagannath]] and made a shrine of Manikeswari at Chilika, now doesn’t exist. Manikeswari is royal family deity of Parlakhemundi. Manikeswari was installed in Bhawanipatna much later around 1849 AD during shifting of the capital from Junagarh. Some people also mention Manikeswari in Thumaul Rampur as Adipitha and Devi was brought to Bhawanipatna from there. Uditnarayan Deo laid the foundation of the present modern temple in Bhawanipatna and it was completed in 1947 by Brajamohan Deo. Manikeswari was associated with Kalahandi history as a goddess of wealth, Manik, since 10th century. There is some debate to relate Manikeswari with Stambeswari temple in Asurgarh-Narla around 5-6th century as well as Maningeeswari in Banapur in Puri. There are many Manikeswari worshiping locations in many place of Odisha and [[Chhattisgarh]], especially in undivided districts of [[Koraput]], [[Phulbani]], [[Boudh]], [[Bolangir]], [[Sonepur District|Sonepur]], [[Ganjam]], Gajapati, [[Angul]], [[Dhenkanal district|Dhenkanal]], [[Keonjhar]], [[Sundergarh]], etc. due to influence by various rulers. Though Manikeswari has much historical significance in Odisha and Chhattisgarh, it has not yet fully been appreciated.

'''Ishana''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ईशान, [[IAST]]: Īśāna), is a [[Hindu god]] and the ''[[Guardians of the directions|dikapala]]'' of the northeast direction.

== Iconography ==
Ishana is described as having three eyes, a tranquil appearance and white complexion, dressed with a white cloth and a tiger's skin.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gopinatha Rao |first=T. A. |url=http://archive.org/details/ElementsOfHinduIconographyVol.IIPartII |title=Elements Of Hindu Iconography, Vol. II Part II |date=1916 |pages=537–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his head, a ''jata-[[Makuṭa|makuta]]'' which has on top of it the crescent moon must be placed.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

He may be seated on a white bull, or simply in the ''[[Padmāsana|padmasana]]'' though being seated on the bull is preferred.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

If he is represented with only two arms, his hands must carry a trident and a [[kapala]] or one of the hands (the left one generally) might be in the ''[[varadamudra]]''; if, however, he has four hands, the two front ones should be sculptured as playing upon a [[veena]] and the others are to be held in the ''varada'' and ''[[Abhayamudra|abhaya]]'' [[mudra]]s.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Gopinatha Rao suggests that description might be incorrect, as the veena must be held only by the hands of the front pair of arms, which are also the very hands that are necessarily to be in the ''varada'' and ''abhaya'' poses.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

When represented in Lingam form along with the other Panchabrahmas, his face, uncarved, would face upward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 2012 |title=Five Powers of Siva : Sadasiva in the Agama Scriptures |url=https://www.himalayanacademy.com/media/books/five-powers-of-siva_ei/five-powers-of-siva_ei.pdf |url-status=live |magazine=[[Hinduism Today]] |location=Kapaa, Hawaii |publisher=Himalayan Academy |page=51 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925013113/https://www.himalayanacademy.com/media/books/five-powers-of-siva_ei/five-powers-of-siva_ei.pdf |archive-date=25 September 2017 |access-date=10 August 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One verse of the Linga Purana describes Ishana as having three feet, seven hands, four horns and two heads&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; while in one verse of the Shiva Purana, he is described as "resembling pure crystal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=J.L.Shastri |url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart4 |title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 4 of 4 |date=1950 |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |pages=2036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ishana is also mentioned in the [[Vajasaneyi Madhyandiniya|Vajasneyi Madyandina Samhita]] of the [[Shukla Yajurveda]] (VS 27.35),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Samhita Patha 21-30 – Adhyaya – 27 {{!}} Vedic Heritage Portal|url=https://vedicheritage.gov.in/samhitas/yajurveda/vajasneyi-madhyandina-samhita/samhita-patha-21-30-adhyaya-27/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200720032129/https://vedicheritage.gov.in/samhitas/yajurveda/vajasneyi-madhyandina-samhita/samhita-patha-21-30-adhyaya-27/|archive-date=20 July 2020|access-date=10 August 2021|website=Vedic Heritage Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the [[Shiva Purana]] calls the "Ishana Mantra",&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shastri|first=J.L|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart1|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 1 of 4|date=1950|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the Purana calls a different verse from the same Samhita which also mentions Ishana (VS 39.8)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Samhita Patha 31-40 – Adhyaya – 39 {{!}} Vedic Heritage Portal|url=https://vedicheritage.gov.in/samhitas/yajurveda/vajasneyi-madhyandina-samhita/samhita-patha-31-40-adhyaya-39/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200712233253/https://vedicheritage.gov.in/samhitas/yajurveda/vajasneyi-madhyandina-samhita/samhita-patha-31-40-adhyaya-39/|archive-date=12 July 2020|access-date=10 August 2021|website=Vedic Heritage Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "Ishana Mantra" as well.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shastri|first=J.L.|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart1|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 1 of 4|date=1950|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|pages=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Puranas ===
Several Puranas mention Ishana; a few of them are detailed here:
==== Shiva Purana ====
In the Shiva Purana, Ishana is described as a form or aspect of Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=J.L.Shastri|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart1|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 1 of 4|date=1950|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shastri|first=J.L.|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart1|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 1 of 4|date=1950|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Purana states that Ishana bestows knowledge and riches on those with intelligence, while curbing evil-doers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shastri|first=J.L.|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart4|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 4 of 4|date=1950|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|pages=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ishana is declared to be the form of Shiva presiding over the ear, speech, sound and ether as well as the "individual soul, the enjoyer of [[Prakṛti|Prakriti]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=J.L.|first=Shastri|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart4|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 4 of 4|date=1950|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|pages=1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Purana also asserts that the "Ishana Mantra" should be recited when fixing [[Lingam]]s to pedestals,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; when wearing ''[[rudraksha]]'' beads on the head&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; or (only for some) when wearing [[Vibhuti|sacred ash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=J.L.Shastri|url=http://archive.org/details/SivaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart1|title=Siva Purana - English Translation - Part 1 of 4|date=1950|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Linga Purana ====
One verse of the [[Linga Purana]] describes Ishana as "the omnipresent lord of all".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shastri|first=J.L.|url=http://archive.org/details/LingaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart1|title=Linga Purana - English Translation - Part 1 of 2|date=1951|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another verse, one who makes the idol of Ishana is said to be "honoured in the world of Vishnu."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shastri|first=J.L.|url=http://archive.org/details/LingaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart1|title=Linga Purana - English Translation - Part 1 of 2|date=1951|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|pages=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one verse, he is said to hold an axe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shastri|first=J.L.|url=http://archive.org/details/LingaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart1|title=Linga Purana - English Translation - Part 1 of 2|date=1951|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|pages=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in another, he is described as wielding a trident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shastri|first=J.L.|url=http://archive.org/details/LingaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart2|title=Linga Purana - English Translation - Part 2 of 2|date=1951|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|pages=564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ishana described as being stationed in every being as the organ of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=J.L.Shastri|url=http://archive.org/details/LingaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart2|title=Linga Purana - English Translation - Part 2 of 2|date=1951|pages=652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Purana mentions Ishana as one of the deities present at [[Daksha yajna|Daksha's sacrifice]] who was attacked by [[Virabhadra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shastri|first=J.L.|url=http://archive.org/details/LingaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart2|title=Linga Purana - English Translation - Part 2 of 2|date=1951|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|pages=556}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also described as having attended the [[svayamvara]] of Parvati to Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=J.L.Shastri|url=http://archive.org/details/LingaPuranaJ.L.ShastriPart2|title=Linga Purana - English Translation - Part 2 of 2|date=1951|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|pages=563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brahmavaivarta Purana ====
The Brahmavaivarta Purana states that Ishana was born out of the left eye of [[Krishna]]. He is described as wearing tiger's skin, adorned with a crescent crown on his head, possessing three eyes and holding a trident, patissa (sword) and club. He became the leader of the Dikpalas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shanti Lal Nagar|url=http://archive.org/details/brahma-vaivarta-purana-all-four-kandas-english-translation|title=Brahma Vaivarta Purana - English Translation - All Four Kandas|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Parimal Publications|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pañchabrahma ===
{{See also|Pancabrahma Upanishad}}
The Pañchabrahmas are five specific aspects of Shiva collectively taken together.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gopinatha Rao|first=T. A.|url=http://archive.org/details/ElementsOfHinduIconographyVol.IIPartII|title=Elements Of Hindu Iconography, Vol. II Part II|date=1916|pages=375}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects include [[Sadyojata]], [[Vamadeva]], [[Aghora (Shiva)|Aghora]], Tatpurusha, and Ishana.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Each of these aspects are glorified in their own mantra in the Pañchabrahma Mantrani present in the Taittiriya Aranyaka (TA 10.17-21).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These aspects of Shiva are often depicted in [[Mukhalinga|five-faced Lingams]] which Stella Kramrisch states are physical equivalents of the five Pañchabrahma Mantrani, with each face of the five-faced lingams corresponding to one of the Mantras and representing a particular manifestation of Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kramrisch|first=Stella|title=The Presence of Shiva|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1981|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the Panchabrahmas, Ishana is the source of spontaneous grace directed to all beings and to all worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=July 2012|title=Five Powers of Siva : Sadasiva in the Agama Scriptures|url=https://www.himalayanacademy.com/media/books/five-powers-of-siva_ei/five-powers-of-siva_ei.pdf|url-status=live|magazine=[[Hinduism Today]]|location=Kapaa, Hawaii|publisher=Himalayan Academy|page=46|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925013113/https://www.himalayanacademy.com/media/books/five-powers-of-siva_ei/five-powers-of-siva_ei.pdf|archive-date=25 September 2017|access-date=10 August 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vastu Shastra ===
According to [[Vastu|Vastu Shastra]], it is auspicious for homes and offices to be situated in the northeast. North is the direction wealth resides, associated with [[Kubera]], while East is the direction where knowledge resides, associated with [[Indra]]. For this reason, Ishana symbolizes the culmination of both knowledge and wealth.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

==Buddhism and Shinto==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2021}}
He is a chief among the gods of [[Paranirmitavaśavarti]], the sixth heaven of the [[Desire realm|Kāmadhātu]].

According to the [[Ainōshō]], there is a theory that this deity is synonymous with [[Mara (demon)|Pāpīyas]] as well as the [[Shinto]] deity [[Izanagi]]. The [[Jinnō Shōtōki]] also states that there is a theory that the names of Japan's primordial creator gods [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]] are the same as the Sanskrit names Īśāna and Īśānī.

'''Īśānī''' is Īśāna's consort. According to the [[Secret Storehouse Records]] (祕藏記) she is flesh white in color and wields a [[Hoko yari|spear]].

'''Amsha''' or '''Ansha''' is a deity in [[Hinduism]] and one of the [[Ādityas]], - a group of celestial deities that populate the sky with their parents [[Kashyapa]] and [[Aditi]]. Amsha is a [[solar deity]].

== The Adityás ==
The oldest legends specify seven or eight of these gods, but the number was later increased to twelve. Historians have suggested that perhaps the number 12 was chosen so that each solar deity related with a particular month, creating a link between each Aditya and the cycle of the year and the seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scimonk.com/index.php/2021/05/26/12-adityas/ "12 Adityas from Shatpata Brahmana" ], ''Scientific Monk'', Retrieved 26 May 2021&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Achuthananda2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Swami Achuthananda|title=The Reign of the Vedic Gods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hhfDwAAQBAJ|date=6 June 2018|publisher=Relianz Communications Pty Ltd|isbn=978-0-9757883-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using the popular name Anśa/Aṃśa ==
In [[India]], today,{{when|date=November 2022}} many boys get a name derived from Anśa (or, Aṃśa) - for example, Anshuman (alt Amshuman) - as a sign of respect for this god.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pitarau.com/meaning-of-ansh "Meaning of name 'Ansh'" ], ''Pitarau'', Retrieved 26 May 2021&lt;/ref&gt;

In post-Vedic [[Hindu texts]], such as the [[Puranas]] and the [[Itihasas]] of Hinduism, the ''Devas'' represent the good, and the ''Asuras'' the bad.&lt;ref name=nickgier/&gt;&lt;ref name=fowlergita/&gt; In some [[List of historic Indian texts|medieval works of Indian literature]], ''Devas'' are also referred to as '''''Suras''''' and contrasted with their equally powerful but malevolent [[half-brother]]s, referred to as the ''Asuras''.&lt;ref name=ang&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/40167/asura/40167rellinks/Related-Links Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Devas'', along with ''Asuras'', ''[[Yaksha]]s'' (nature spirits), and ''[[Rakshasa]]s'' (ghoulish ogres/[[demons]]), are part of Indian mythology, and ''Devas'' feature in many cosmological theories in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;Don Handelman (2013), One God, Two Goddesses, Three Studies of South Indian Cosmology, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004256156}}, pages 23-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger (1988), Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|978-0719018664}}, page 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Deva'' is a [[Sanskrit]] word found in Vedic literature of 2nd millennium BCE. [[Monier Monier-Williams|Monier-Williams]] translates it as "heavenly, divine, terrestrial things of high excellence, exalted, shining ones".&lt;ref name=monier/&gt;&lt;ref name=klausklos&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (2010), A Survey of Hinduism, 3rd Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791470824}}, pages 101-102&lt;/ref&gt; The concept also is used to refer to deity.&lt;ref name=monier/&gt;

The Sanskrit ''deva-''  derives from [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Indo-Iranian]] ''*daiv-'' which in turn descends from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word, ''*[[deiwo-]]'', originally an adjective meaning "celestial" or "shining", which is a (not synchronic Sanskrit) [[vrddhi]] derivative from ''*diw'', zero-grade of the root ''*dyew-'' meaning "to shine", especially as the day-lit sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/indoeurop.html|title=Appendix I - Indo-European Roots}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feminine form of ''*deiwos'' is ''*deiwih&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', which descends into Indic languages as ''[[devi]]'', in that context meaning "female deity". Also deriving from ''*deiwos'', and thus cognates of ''deva'', are "Zeys/''Ζεύς''" - "Dias/''Δίας''", the Greek father of the gods, Lithuanian [[Dievas]] (Latvian [[Dievs]], Prussian [[Deiwas]]), Germanic [[Tiwaz]] (seen in English "''Tue''sday") and the related Old Norse Tivar (gods),  and Latin [[Deus]] "god" and ''divus'' "divine", from which the English words "divine" and "deity" are derived. It is related to ''*[[Dyeus]]'' which while from the same root, may originally have referred to the "heavenly shining father", and hence to "Father Sky", the chief God of the Indo-European pantheon, continued in Sanskrit [[Dyaus]]. The abode of the Devas is [[Dyuloka]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0500/mw__0533.html Dyuloka], Monier Monier-Williams, English Sanskrit Dictionary with Etymology, Oxford University Press, page 500&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Douglas Harper, the etymological roots of ''Deva'' mean "a shining one," from *div- "to shine," and it is cognate with Greek dios "divine" and [[Zeus]], and Latin deus "god" (Old Latin deivos).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=deva&amp;searchmode=none Deva] Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The word "Deva" shares similarities with Persian [[Daeva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krishnan |first1=K.

Deva is masculine; the related feminine equivalent is [[devi]].&lt;ref name=monierdevi&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary” Etymologically and Philologically Arranged to cognate Indo-European Languages, Motilal Banarsidass, page 496&lt;/ref&gt; Etymologically, ''Devi'' is cognate with Latin ''dea''.&lt;ref&gt;John Stratton Hawley and Donna Marie Wulff (1998), Devi: Goddesses of India, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814912}}, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; When capitalized, ''Devi'' or ''Mata'' refers to a divine mother goddess in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;John Stratton Hawley and Donna Marie Wulff (1998), Devi: Goddesses of India, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814912}}, pages 18-21&lt;/ref&gt; ''Deva'' is also referred to as ''Devatā'',&lt;ref name=klausklos/&gt; and ''Devi'' as ''Devika''.&lt;ref name=monierdevi/&gt;

The word ''Deva'' is also a proper name or part of a name in Indian culture, where it refers to "one who wishes to excel, overcome" or the "seeker of, master of or a best among".&lt;ref name=monier/&gt;

Some devas represent the forces of nature and some represent moral values (such as the [[Aditya]]s, [[Varuna]], and [[Mitra]]), each symbolizing the epitome of a specialized knowledge, creative energy, exalted and magical powers (''Siddhis'').&lt;ref&gt;George Williams (2008), A Handbook of Hindu Mythology, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195332612}}, pages 24-33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=binagupta&gt;Bina Gupta (2011), An Introduction to Indian Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415800037}}, pages 21-25&lt;/ref&gt; The most referred to Devas in the [[Rig Veda]] are [[Indra]], [[Agni]] (fire) and [[Soma (deity)|Soma]], with "fire deity" called the friend of all humanity, it and Soma being the two celebrated in a [[yajna]] fire ritual that marks major Hindu ceremonies. [[Savitr]], [[Vishnu]], [[Rudra]] (later given the exclusive epithet of [[Shiva]]), and [[Prajapati]] (later [[Brahma]]) are gods and hence Devas.

===Henotheism===
In Vedic literature, ''Deva'' is not a monotheistic God; rather a "supernatural, divine" concept manifesting in various ideas and knowledge, in a form that combines excellence in some aspects, wrestling with weakness and questions in other aspects, heroic in their outlook and actions, yet tied up with emotions and desires.&lt;ref name=binagupta/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker (2014), God: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198708957}}, pages 88-96&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Muller]] states that the Vedic hymns are remarkable in calling every one of the different devas as "the only one, the supreme, the greatest".&lt;ref name=klausklos/&gt; Muller concluded that the Vedic ideas about ''devas'' are best understood neither as [[polytheism]] nor as [[monotheism]], but as [[henotheism]] where gods are equivalent, different perspectives, different aspects of reverence and spirituality, unified by principles of [[Ṛta]] and [[Dharma]].&lt;ref name=klausklos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Strenski (2015), Understanding Theories of Religion: An Introduction, 2nd Edition, Wiley, {{ISBN|978-1444330847}}, page 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics of Devas in the Vedic literature===
[[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] states that Devas and Asuras in the Vedic lore are similar to the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]] and [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] of Greek mythology. Both are powerful but have different orientations and inclinations, with the Devas representing the powers of Light and the Asuras representing the powers of Darkness in Hindu mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ananda Coomaraswamy (1935), Angel and Titan: An Essay in Vedic Ontology, Journal of the American Oriental Society, volume 55, pages 373-374&lt;/ref&gt; According to Coomaraswamy's interpretation of Devas and Asuras, both these natures exist in each human being, both the tyrant and the angel. The best and the worst within each person struggles before choices and one's own nature, and the Hindu formulation of Devas and Asuras is an eternal dance between these within each person.&lt;ref&gt;Ananda Coomaraswamy (1935), Angel and Titan: An Essay in Vedic Ontology, Journal of the American Oriental Society, volume 55, pages 373-418&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gier&gt;Nicholas Gier (1995), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1399510 Hindu Titanism], Philosophy East and West, Volume 45, Number 1, pages 76, see also 73-96&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|
The Devas and Asuras, Angels and Titans, powers of Light and powers of Darkness in Rigveda, although distinct and opposite in operation, are in essence consubstantial, their distinction being a matter not of essence but of orientation, revolution or transformation. In this case, the Titan is potentially an Angel, the Angel still by nature a Titan; the Darkness in ''actu'' is Light, the Light in ''potentia'' Darkness; whence the designations Asura and Deva may be applied to one and the same Person according to the mode of operation, as in Rigveda 1.163.3, "Trita art thou (Agni) by interior operation".

All-powerful beings, good or evil, are called Devas&lt;ref name="monier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="George Williams 2008"/&gt; and Asuras in the oldest layer of Vedic texts. A much-studied hymn of the Rigveda states ''Devav asura'' (Asuras who have become Devas), and contrasts it with ''Asura adevah'' (Asuras who are not Devas).&lt;ref name=kuiper&gt;FBJ Kuiper (1975), The Basic Concept of Vedic Religion, History of Religion, volume 15, pages 108-112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, pages 1-2; Note: Hale translates this to "Asuras without the Asura-Devas" in his book, see page 3 for example.;&lt;br&gt;For original Sanskrit, see Rigveda hymns 8.25.4 and 8.96.9 [https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेदः_मण्डल_८ Rigveda - Wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt; They are born from the same father, Prajapati, the primordial progenitor; his sons are envisioned as the Asuras and Devas.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (1981), History of Religious Ideas, Volume 1, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226204017}}, page 204, 199-202, 434-435&lt;/ref&gt; They all share the same residence (''Loka''), eat together the same food and drinks (''Soma''), and have innate potential, knowledge and special powers in Hindu mythology; the only thing that distinguishes "Asuras who become Devas" from "Asuras who remain Asuras" is intent, action and choices they make in their mythic lives.&lt;ref name=Gier/&gt;&lt;ref name=yves&gt;Yves Bonnefoy and Wendy Doniger (1993), Asian Mythologies, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226064567}}, pages 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upanishads==
[[File:Vishnu seated on Ananda. Cave3Badami.jpg|thumb|[[Vishnu]] (above) is one of the Vedic Devas.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Oldenberg (1988), The Religion of the Veda, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803923}}, pages 116-117&lt;/ref&gt; The third Valli of the [[Katha Upanishad]] discusses ethical duties of man through the parable of the chariot as a means to realize the state of Vishnu, one with Self-knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 287-289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Goodall (1996), Hindu Scriptures, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520207783}}, pages 175-176&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The oldest Upanishads mention ''Devas'', and their struggle with the ''Asuras''. The [[Kaushitaki Upanishad]], for example, in Book 4 states that "[[Indra]] was weaker than the Asuras when he did not know his own [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, self).&lt;ref name=deussenku/&gt; Once Indra had self-knowledge, he became independent, sovereign and victorious over the Asuras"; similarly, states Kaushitaki Upanishad, "the man who knows his inner self gains independence, sovereignty and is unaffected by all evil".&lt;ref name=deussenku&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chandogya Upanishad]], in chapter 1.2, describes the battle between Devas and Asuras on various sensory powers.&lt;ref name=deussencu/&gt; This battle between good and evil fails to produce a victor and simply manifests itself in the perceived universe, as good or evil sights witnessed by beings, as good or evil words shared between people, as good or evil smells of nature, as good or evil feelings experienced, as good or evil thoughts within each person. Finally, the Deva-Asura battle targets the soul, where Asuras fail and Devas succeed, because soul-force is serene and inherently good, asserts Chandogya Upanishad.&lt;ref name=deussencu&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 70-71&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 3.5.2 of the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] describes Devas, Men, and Asuras as sons of Prajapati, the primordial father.&lt;ref name=deussenbu/&gt; Each asks for a lesson on ethics. Prajapati tells the Devas to observe the virtue of temperance (self-restraint, ''Dama''), the Men to observe the virtue of charity (''Dana''), and Asuras to observe the virtue of compassion (''Daya''). At the end of the chapter, the Upanishad declares that these are three cardinal virtues that should always be observed by all Devas, Men and Asuras.&lt;ref name=deussenbu&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 508-509&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval era Indian scholars, in their ''Bhasya'' (review and commentaries) on the Upanishads, stated that the discussion of Devas and Asuras in the Upanishads is symbolic, and it represents the good and evil that resides and struggles within each human being. [[Adi Shankara]], for example, in his commentary on [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] asserted that Devas represent the human seeking for the sacred and spiritual, while the Asuras represent the human seeking for the worldly excesses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Muller]], [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/78/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.3.1] Oxford University Press, page 78 with footnote 2&lt;/ref&gt; Edelmann and other modern era scholars also state that the Devas versus Asuras discussion in Upanishads is a form of symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Edelmann (2013), Hindu Theology as Churning the Latent, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Volume 81, Issue 2, pages 427-466&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doris Srinivasan (1997), Many Heads, Arms and Eyes: Origin, Meaning, and Form of Multiplicity in Indian Art, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004107588}}, pages 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later primary [[Upanishad]]ic texts, Devas and Asuras discuss and act to seek knowledge, for different purposes. In one case, for example, they go to Prajāpati, their father, to understand what is Self (Atman, soul) and how to realize it. The first answer that Prajāpati gives is simplistic, which the Asuras accept and leave with, but the Devas led by Indra do not accept and question because Indra finds that he hasn't grasped its full significance and the given answer has inconsistencies.&lt;ref name=edelmann14/&gt; Edelmann states that this symbolism embedded in the Upanishads is a reminder that one must struggle with presented ideas, learning is a process, and Deva nature emerges with effort.&lt;ref name=edelmann14/&gt;

==Puranas and Itihasas==
In the [[Puranas]] and the [[Itihasas]] with the embedded Bhagavad Gita, the Devas represent the good, and the Asuras the bad.&lt;ref name=nickgier&gt;Nicholas Gier (2000), Spiritual Titanism: Indian, Chinese, and Western Perspectives, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791445280}}, pages 59-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fowlergita/&gt; According to the [[Bhagavad Gita]] (16.6-16.7), all beings in the universe have both the divine qualities (''daivi sampad'') and the demonic qualities (''asuri sampad'') within each.&lt;ref name=fowlergita/&gt;&lt;ref name=chrischapple/&gt; The sixteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita states that pure god-like saints are rare and pure demon-like evil are rare among human beings, and the bulk of humanity is multi-charactered with a few or many faults.&lt;ref name=fowlergita/&gt; According to Jeaneane Fowler, the Gita states that desires, aversions, greed, needs, emotions in various forms "are facets of ordinary lives", and it is only when they turn to lust, hate, cravings, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness, hypocrisy, violence, cruelty and such negativity- and destruction-inclined that natural human inclinations metamorphose into something demonic (Asura).&lt;ref name=fowlergita&gt;Jeaneane D Fowler (2012), The Bhagavad Gita, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1845193461}}, pages 253-262&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chrischapple&gt;Christopher K Chapple (2010), The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438428420}}, pages 610-629&lt;/ref&gt;

Everyone starts as an Asura in Hindu mythology, born of the same father. "Asuras who remain Asura" share the character of powerful beings obsessed with their craving for more power, more wealth, ego, anger, unprincipled nature, force and violence.&lt;ref name=gierasurach/&gt;&lt;ref name=stellaray/&gt; The "Asuras who become Devas" in contrast are driven by an inner voice, seek understanding and meaning, prefer moderation, principled behavior, morals, knowledge, and harmony.&lt;ref name=gierasurach&gt;Nicholas Gier (1995), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1399510 Hindu Titanism], Philosophy East and West, Volume 45, Number 1, pages 76-80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stellaray&gt;Stella Kramrisch and Raymond Burnier (1986), The Hindu Temple, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802230}}, pages 75-78&lt;/ref&gt; The hostility between the two is the source of extensive legends and tales in the Puranic and the Epic literature of Hinduism; however, many texts discuss their hostility in neutral terms and without explicit condemnation.&lt;ref name=yves/&gt; Some of these tales are the basis for myths behind major Hindu festivals, such as the story of Asura Ravana and Deva Rama in the [[Ramayana]] and the legend of Asura [[Hiranyakashipu]] and Deva Vishnu as [[Narasimha]],&lt;ref name=yves/&gt; the latter celebrated with the Hindu spring festival of [[Holika]] and [[Holi]].&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger (2000), Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions, Merriam-Webster, {{ISBN|978-0877790440}}, page 455&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bhagavata Purana===
In [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Brahma]] had ten sons: [[Marichi]], [[Atri]], [[Angiras (sage)|Angira]], [[Pulastya]], [[Pulaha]], [[Kratu]], [[Vasistha]], [[Daksha|Daksa]], [[Narada]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavata Purana 3.12.21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Marici had a son called [[Kasyapa]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavata Purana 4.1.13&lt;/ref&gt; Kasyapa had thirteen wives: [[Aditi]], [[Diti]], [[Danu (Asura)|Danu]], [[Kadru]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavata Purana 6.6.24-26&lt;/ref&gt; The sons of Aditi are called [[Adityas]],&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavata Purana 8.13.6&lt;/ref&gt; the sons of Diti are called [[Daityas]],&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavata Purana 6.18.11&lt;/ref&gt; and the sons of Danu are called [[Danavas]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavata Purana 5.24.30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bṛhaspati]] ([[Jupiter]], son of Angiras) is a [[guru]] of devas (vedic gods). [[Shukra]]charya ([[Venus]], son of [[Bhrigu]]) is a guru of [[asura]]s (vedic [[demon]]s) or/and [[Danavas]].

===Symbolism===
Edelmann states that the dichotomies present in the [[Purana]]s literature of Hinduism are symbolism for spiritual concepts. For example, god Indra (a Deva) and the antigod Virocana (an Asura) question a sage for insights into the knowledge of the self.&lt;ref name=edelmann14/&gt; Virocana leaves with the first given answer, believing now he can use the knowledge as a weapon. In contrast, Indra keeps pressing the sage, churning the ideas, and learning about means to inner happiness and power. Edelmann suggests that the Deva-Asura dichotomies in Hindu mythology may be seen as "narrative depictions of tendencies within our selves".&lt;ref name=edelmann14&gt;Jonathan Edelmann (2013), Hindu Theology as Churning the Latent, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Volume 81, Issue 2, pages 439-441&lt;/ref&gt;

The god (Deva) and antigod (Asura), states Edelmann, are also symbolically the contradictory forces that motivate each individual and people, and thus Deva-Asura dichotomy is a spiritual concept rather than mere genealogical category or species of being.&lt;ref name=edelmann13/&gt; In the Bhāgavata Purana, saints and gods are born in families of Asuras, such as [[Mahabali]] and [[Prahlada]], conveying the symbolism that motivations, beliefs, and actions rather than one's birth and family circumstances define whether one is Deva-like or Asura-like.&lt;ref name=edelmann13&gt;Jonathan Edelmann (2013), Hindu Theology as Churning the Latent, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Volume 81, Issue 2, pages 440-442&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], Devas are celestial beings associated with various aspects of the cosmos. 
Devas such as [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]], form the [[Trimurti|Hindu trinity]] known as the Trimurthi and preside over the functioning of the cosmos and the evolution of creation.

Lesser devas may control the forces of nature, such as [[Vayu]], the Lord of the wind, [[Varuna]] the Lord of water, and [[Agni]], the lord of fire.

Hinduism also has many other lesser celestial beings, such as the married [[Gandharvas]] (male celestial musicians) and [[Apsaras]] (female celestial dancers).

'''Kshetrapala''' ( Pronounced: Xetra pala) is a guardian deity in [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. According to Hinduism and [[Hindu mythology]], Kshetrapala, that is, the lord of the farmland, is a deity who was originally a deity of the farmland, particularly in the [[south India]].  Over a period of time, Kshetrapala became a generic name applied to deities associated with a piece or parcel of land, or a particular region (kshetra in [[Sanskrit]]). His temples are generally constructed on the northeastern corner of temples devoted to [[Shiva]], and he is worshipped prior to each ritual to ensure the efficacy of that particular ritual.

==The image==
{{Unsourced section|date=August 2016}}
Kshetrapala's images are awe-inspiring; he is generally depicted naked, and is shown with three eyes and untidy hair. He is displayed with wielding a number of weapons and accompanied by [[shvan]]s (dogs). He is sometimes identified with [[Bhairava]].
Kshetrapala temple is also situated in the village Khadagada, Tehsil Sagwara, district Dungerpur, Rajasthan.

== Etymology ==
L. B. Keny proposes that Narayana was associated with the [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]], and ultimately, the [[Indus Valley civilisation|Indus Valley Civilisation]], prior to his syncretism with Vishnu. To this end, he states that the etymology of the deity is associated with the Dravidian ''nara'', meaning water, ''ay'', which in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] means "to lie in a place", and ''an'', which is the masculine termination in [[Dravidian languages]]. He asserts that this is also the reason why Narayana is represented as lying on a [[Shesha|serpent]] in the sea. He quotes, "This Nārāyana of the Āryan pantheon seems to be the supreme being of the Mohenjo-Darians, a god who was probably styled Ān, a name still kept in [[Tamil literature]] as Āndivanam, the prototype of the historic [[Shiva|Siva]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Klostermaier |first=Klaus K. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFQ9DgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=narayana+dravidian&amp;pg=PA70 |title=Mythologies and Philosophies of Salvation in the Theistic Traditions of India |date=2006-01-01 |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ.

==Description==

In the [[Vedas]] and [[Puranas]], Narayana is described as having the divine blackish-blue color of water-filled clouds, four-armed, holding a [[Padma (Vishnu)|Padma]] (lotus), [[Kaumodaki]] (mace), [[Panchajanya]] [[shankha]] (conch), and the [[Sudarshana Chakra]] (discus).

{{Main|Hinduism}}

As stated in the epic ''[[Itihasa|Itihāsa]],'' the [[Mahabharata]]:

{{blockquote|&lt;poem&gt;I am Narayana, the Source of all things, the Eternal, the Unchangeable. I am the Creator of all things, and the Destroyer also of all. I am [[Vishnu]], I am [[Brahma]] and I am [[Shiva|Shankara]], the chief of the gods. I am king Vaisravana, and I am Yama, the lord of the deceased spirits. I am [[Shiva|Siva]], I am Soma, and I am [[Kasyapa]] the lord of the created things. And, O best of regenerate ones, I am he called Dhatri, and he also that is called Vidhatri, and I am Sacrifice embodied. Fire is my mouth, the earth my feet, and the Sun and the Moon are my eyes; the Heaven is the crown of my head, the firmament and the cardinal points are my ears; the waters are born of my sweat. Space with the cardinal points are my body, and the Air is my mind...

...And, O Brahmana, whatever is obtained by men by the practice of truth, charity, ascetic austerities, and peace and harmlessness towards all creatures, and such other handsome deeds, is obtained because of my arrangements. Governed by my ordinance, men wander within my body, their senses overwhelmed by me. They move not according to their will but as they are moved by me.&lt;/poem&gt;|source=Mahabharata (translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, 1883-1896), Book 3, Varna Parva, Chapter CLXXXVIII (188)&lt;ref name="sacred-texts.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03188.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Markandeya-Samasya Parva: Section CLXXXVIII|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2019-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=}}

As per texts like the ''[[Vishnu Purana]], [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Garuda Purana]], and the [[Padma Purana]]'', Narayana is [[Vishnu]] himself who incarnates in [[Dashavatara|various avatars]].

According to the [[Bhagavad Gita]], he is also the "Guru of the Universe". The Bhagavata Purana declares Narayana as the [[Supreme Personality of Godhead]], who engages in the creation of 14 worlds within the universe [[Brahma]] who is Deity of [[rajas]]-[[guna]], himself sustains, maintains and preserves the universe as [[Vishnu]] by accepting [[sattva]]-[[guna]]. Narayana himself annihilates the universe at the end of ''Maha-Kalpa'' as Kalagni [[Rudra]] who is presiding deity of [[Tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]-[[guna]].

According to the [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Purusha Sukta]], [[Narayana Sukta]], and [[Narayana Upanishad]] from the Vedas, he is the ultimate soul.

According to [[Madhvacharya]], Narayana is one of the five [[vyuha]]s of [[Vishnu]], which are cosmic emanations of God in contrast to his incarnate [[avatar]]s. Madhvacharya separates Vishnu's manifestations into two groups: Vishnu's vyuhas (emanations) and His avataras (incarnations).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ghosh |first=A. |date=2009-03-02 |title=Krishna: A Sourcebook.

They are mechanisms by which the universe is ordered, was created, and evolves. Narayana possesses the [[Caturvyūha|chatur-vyuha]] aspects of Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha, who evolve one after the other in the development of the universe.In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', [[Krishna]] is also synonymous with Narayana and [[Arjuna]] is referred to as Nara.&lt;ref&gt;''Vaisnavism Saivism and Minor Religious Systems'', Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar.

Narayana is also described in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] as having a universal form (''[[Vishvarupa]]'') which is beyond the ordinary limits of human perception or imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://vedabase.net/bg/11/3/en1 |title = Bhagavad-gita As It Is Chapter 11 Verse 3 |publisher = vedabase.net |access-date = 10 May 2008 |last = Prabhupada |author-link = Prabhupada |first = AC Bhaktivedanta |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080515014652/http://vedabase.net/bg/11/3/en1 |archive-date = 15 May 2008 }} "see the cosmic manifestation"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Narayana sukta|Narayana Sukta]], Narayana is essentially the supreme force and/or essence of all: ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Nārāyaṇa parabrahman tatvam Nārāyaṇa paraha'.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=॥ नारायणसूक्तम् सार्थ ॥ - ..

Narayana's eternal and supreme abode beyond the material universe is [[Vaikuntha]] which is a realm of bliss and happiness called [[Moksha|Paramapadha]], which means final or highest place for liberated souls, where they enjoy bliss and happiness for eternity in the company of the supreme lord. Vaikuntha is situated beyond the material universe and hence, cannot be perceived or measured by material science or logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tirumala.org/sapthagiri/062003/vaikuntha.htm |title=Sapthagiri |access-date=21 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515224306/http://www.tirumala.org/sapthagiri/062003/vaikuntha.htm |archive-date=15 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, [[Ksheera Sagara]] where Narayana or [[Vishnu]] rests on [[Ananta Shesha]] is also perceived as ''Vaikuntha'' within the material universe.

The [[Śruti]] texts mention Narayana as the primordial being , who was present even when [[Brahma]] and Ishana ([[Shiva]]) were not present. Thus, He is the Supreme Soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://upanishads.org.in/otherupanishads/47/1|title=Upanishads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
The ''Mahāsamaya Sutta'' (DN 20) of the [[Pali Canon]] mentions a deity by the name ''Veṇhu'' (Sanskrit: ''Viṣṇu''), though the text suggests that this name may also signify a class of deva. He also appears in the ''Veṇḍu Sutta'' (SN 2.12) as ''Veṇḍu'' where he addresses [[Gautama Buddha]] by celebrating the joy experienced by those who follow the [[Dharma#Buddhism|Dhamma]]. He also makes brief mention of [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SN 2.12: With Vishnu —Bhikkhu Sujato |url=https://suttacentral.net/sn2.12/en/sujato |website=SuttaCentral |access-date=25 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahayana Buddhism]] elaborates on the character of this deity, where is often called ''Nārāyaṇa'' ({{zh|c=那羅延天}}; {{bo|t=མཐུ་བོ་ཆེ།}}) or more rarely, ''[[Narasiṃha]]'' ({{lang|zh|納拉辛哈}}) and ''[[Vāsudeva]]'' ({{lang|zh|婆藪天}}). Literature often depicts him as a [[Vajradhara]] ({{lang|zh|金剛力士}}). He is present in the [[Womb Realm|Womb Realm Mandala]] and is among the twelve guardian devas of the [[Diamond Realm|Diamond Realm Mandala]]. He is associated with [[Shravana|Śrāvaṇa]] in esoteric astrology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=那羅延 |url=http://www.buddhism-dict.net/cgi-bin/xpr-ddb.pl?q=%E9%82%A3%E7%BE%85%E5%BB%B6 |website=Digital Dictionary of Buddhism |access-date=25 December 2019 |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His queen consort is Nārāyaṇī.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Giebel |first1=Rolf W.

The [[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra]] describes him as having three faces with a greenish-yellow complexion. He holds a wheel in his right hand and rides upon a [[garuḍa]]. Chapter 6 of the [[Yiqiejing Yinyi (Huilin)|Yiqiejing Yinyi]] explains that he belongs to the [[Kāmadhātu]] and is veneration for the acquisition of power. Chapter 41 adds that he has eight arms that wield various "Dharma weapons" (''dharmayuda'') with which he subjugates the [[asura (Buddhism)|asuras]].

He appears as an [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] in several [[Mahayana sutras]], including the ''[[Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra|Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra]]'', ''Sarvapuṇyasamuccayasamādhi Sūtra'' and the ''Nārāyaṇaparipṛcchā Dhāraṇī''.

He is also mentioned in several places in the [[Lalitavistara Sūtra]], one of the [[Sutras]] that describe the life of [[Gautama Buddha]]. It is said that The Buddha "is endowed with the great strength of Nārāyaṇa, he is called the great Nārāyaṇa himself."

=== Jainism ===
{{Main|Jainism}}

[[Balabhadra]] and ''Narayana'' are mighty half brothers, who appear nine times in each half of the time cycles of the [[Jain cosmology]] and jointly rule half the earth as half-chakravarti. Ultimately ''Prati-naryana'' is killed by ''Narayana'' for his unrighteousness and immorality. Narayana are extremely powerful and are as powerful as 2 Balabhadras. Chakravartins are as powerful as 2 Narayanas. Hence Narayanas become half-chakravartins. Tirthankaras are much more powerful than Chakravartins. In Jain Mahabharta, there is a friendly duel between cousin brothers [[Neminatha]] (Tirthankara) and Krishna (Naryana) in which Neminath defeats Krishna without any effort at all. There is also a story of Neminath lifting Conch of Krishna and blowing it without any effort. In Jain Mahabharat, the main fight between Krishna and Jarasandha is described, who is killed by Krishna.

==Literature==

Narayana is hailed in certain parts of [[Vedas]] like the Narayana Suktam and Vishnu Suktam. He Narayana is also hailed in selective Vaishnava [[Upanishads]] like the [[Narayana Upanishad]], Maha Narayana Upanishad, and the Narasimha Tapani Upanishad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Narayanastra – Defending Vaishnavism as the supreme Vedic position|url = http://narayanastra.blogspot.in/|website = narayanastra.blogspot.in|access-date = 21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Padma Purana]] relates an episode where Narayana grants Rudra (Shiva) a boon. The destroyer deity seeks two boons. Firstly, he wishes to be the greatest of the devotees of Narayana, as well as bearing the reputation of the same throughout the world. Secondly, he desires the ability to offer salvation to whoever seeks refuge in him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2019-09-26 |title=Nārāyaṇa Grants Boons to Rudra [Chapter 2] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-padma-purana/d/doc365433.html |access-date=2022-08-12 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prowess of Narayana is described in the [[Ramayana]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2020-09-27 |title=The Combat between Vishnu and the Rakshasas [Chapter 7] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-ramayana-of-valmiki/d/doc424768.html |access-date=2022-08-12 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|text=Narayana, like unto a luminous cloud, with his excellent shafts loosed from His bow, as so many lightning strokes, exterminated those rangers of the night with their hair dishevelled and streaming in the wind. Their parasols broken, their rich apparel torn by the shafts, their entrails ripped open, their eyes wide with fear, those warriors, throwing away their arms, fell into a frenzy of terror. Resembling elephants attacked by a lion, those night-rangers with their mounts emitted cries whilst fleeing from that Primeval Lion [i.e., Vishnu’s incarnation as Nrsimha—half man, half lion], who pursued them.|author=[[Valmiki]]|title=[[Ramayana]]|source=Book 7, Chapter 7}}

[[Ramanuja]]'s prayer of surrender to Narayana in the ''Sharanagati Gadya'' of the [[Tiruvaymoli]] was and is significant to his Sri Vaishnava adherents, as it became a model prayer for future generations. In this prayer, Ramanuja describes Narayana to be the "beloved consort of Sri and of Bhumi and NIla". He is stated to reside in his abode of Vaikuntha, where he assumes the role of the creation, preservation, as well as the destruction of the universe. Narayana is extolled to be the same as the Ultimate Reality, [[Brahman]]. He is regarded to be the refuge of all creation, the master of spiritual as well as material entities, as well as the dispeller of the miseries of his devotees. He ends his prayer by saluting Narayana and his consort Sri, to whom he surrenders to his "lotus-like feet".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Makarand Joshi |url=http://archive.org/details/thetamilvedapillaninterpretationoftiruvaymolijcarmanandvnarayanan1989ocr |title=The Tamil Veda Pillan Interpretation Of Tiruvaymoli J Carman And V Narayanan 1989 OCR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical and literary sources ==
The tradition of Krishna appears to be an amalgamation of several independent deities of ancient India, the earliest to be attested being [[Vāsudeva]].&lt;ref name="GDF119"&gt;{{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontohi0000floo/page/119 119]–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vāsudeva was a hero-god of the tribe of the [[Vrishni]]s, belonging to the [[Vrishni heroes]], whose worship is attested from the 5th-6th century BCE in the writings of [[Pāṇini]], and from the 2nd century BCE in epigraphy with the [[Heliodorus pillar]].&lt;ref name="GDF119"/&gt; At one point in time, it is thought that the tribe of the Vrishnis fused with the tribe of the Yadavas/Abhiras, whose own hero-god was named Krishna.&lt;ref name="GDF119"/&gt; Vāsudeva and Krishna fused to become a single deity, which appears in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', and they started to be identified with [[Vishnu]] in the ''Mahabharata'' and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.&lt;ref name="GDF119"/&gt; Around the 4th century CE, another tradition, the cult of [[Gopala-Krishna]] of the Ābhīras, the protector of cattle, was also absorbed into the Krishna tradition.&lt;ref name="GDF119"/&gt;

The [[Heliodorus Pillar]], a stone pillar with a Brahmi script inscription, was discovered by colonial era archaeologists in Besnagar ([[Vidisha]], central Indian state of [[Madhya Pradesh]]). Based on the internal evidence of the inscription, it has been dated to between 125 and 100{{nbsp}}BCE and is now known after [[Heliodorus (ambassador)|Heliodorus]] – an [[Indo-Greek]] who served as an ambassador of the Greek king [[Antialcidas]] to a regional Indian king, Kasiputra [[Bhagabhadra]].&lt;ref name="Bopearachchi" /&gt;&lt;ref name=allchin309 /&gt; The Heliodorus pillar inscription is a private religious dedication of Heliodorus to "[[Vāsudeva]]", an early deity and another name for Krishna in the Indian tradition. It states that the column was constructed by "the ''Bhagavata'' Heliodorus" and that it is a "''Garuda'' pillar" (both are Vishnu-Krishna-related terms). Additionally, the inscription includes a Krishna-related verse from chapter{{nbsp}}11.7 of the ''Mahabharata'' stating that the path to immortality and heaven is to correctly live a life of three virtues: self-[[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] (''damah''), generosity (''cagah'' or ''tyaga''), and vigilance (''apramadah'').&lt;ref name=allchin309 /&gt;&lt;ref name=salomon265&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Salomon|title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-535666-3|pages=265–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamín Preciado-Solís|title=The Kṛṣṇa Cycle in the Purāṇas: Themes and Motifs in a Heroic Saga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvCaWvjGDVEC&amp;pg=PA34 |year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-0-89581-226-1|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Heliodorus pillar site was fully excavated by archaeologists in the 1960s.

The inscriptional record for [[Vāsudeva]] starts in the 2nd century BCE with the coinage of Agathocles and the Heliodorus pillar, but the name of Krishna appears rather later in epigraphy. At the [[Chilas]] II archaeological site dated to the first half of the 1st-century CE in northwest Pakistan, near the Afghanistan border, are engraved two males, along with many Buddhist images nearby. The larger of the two males held a plough and club in his two hands. The artwork also has an inscription with it in Kharosthi script, which has been deciphered by scholars as ''Rama-Krsna'', and interpreted as an ancient depiction of the two brothers, Balarama and Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Doris Srinivasan|title=Many Heads, Arms, and Eyes: Origin, Meaning, and Form of Multiplicity in Indian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZheP9dIX9wC |year=1997|publisher=Broll Academic|isbn=90-04-10758-4|pages=214–215 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason Neelis|title=Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks: Mobility and Exchange Within and Beyond the Northwestern Borderlands of South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GB-JV2eOr2UC |year=2010|publisher=Btill Academic|isbn=978-90-04-18159-5|pages=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest text containing detailed descriptions of Krishna as a personality is the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', which depicts Krishna as an incarnation of Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url= https://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-357806/Mahabharata|title= Britannica: Mahabharata|access-date=2008-10-13 |encyclopedia = encyclopedia|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Online |year= 2008|author = Wendy Doniger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krishna is central to many of the main stories of the epic. The eighteen chapters of the sixth book (''Bhishma Parva'') of the epic that constitute the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' contain the advice of Krishna to [[Arjuna]] on the battlefield. The ''[[Harivamsa]]'', a later appendix to the ''Mahabharata,'' contains a detailed version of Krishna's childhood and youth.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Winternitz (1981), ''History of Indian Literature'', Vol. 1, Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-0836408010}}, pp. 426–431&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'', estimated to have been composed sometime between the 8th and 6th{{nbsp}}centuries{{nbsp}}BCE, has been another source of speculation regarding Krishna in ancient India. The verse (III.xvii.6) mentions Krishna in ''Krishnaya Devakiputraya'' as a student of the sage Ghor' of the Angirasa family. Ghora is identified with [[Neminatha]], the twenty-second ''[[tirthankara]]'' in [[Jainism]], by some scholars.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=23}} This phrase, which means "To Krishna the son of [[Devaki]]", has been mentioned by scholars such as [[Max Müller]]&lt;ref name=maxmuller316&gt;Max Müller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/48/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad 3.16–3.17], The Upanishads, Part{{nbsp}}I, Oxford University Press, pp. 50–53 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; as a potential source of fables and Vedic lore about Krishna in the ''Mahabharata'' and other ancient literature{{snd}} only potential because this verse could have been interpolated into the text,&lt;ref name=maxmuller316 /&gt; or the Krishna Devakiputra, could be different from the deity Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bryant and Maria Ekstrand (2004), ''The Hare Krishna Movement'', Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231122566}}, pp. 33–34 with note 3&lt;/ref&gt; These doubts are supported by the fact that the much later age ''Sandilya Bhakti Sutras'', a treatise on Krishna,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ShandilyaBhaktiSutra/shandilya_bhakti_sutras#page/n0/mode/2up Sandilya Bhakti Sutra] SS Rishi (Translator), Sree Gaudia Math (Madras)&lt;/ref&gt; cites later age compilations such as the ''[[Narayana Upanishad]]'' but never cites this verse of the Chandogya Upanishad. Other scholars disagree that the Krishna mentioned along with [[Devaki]] in the ancient Upanishad is unrelated to the later Hindu god of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' fame. For example, Archer states that the coincidence of the two names appearing together in the same Upanishad verse cannot be dismissed easily.&lt;ref&gt;WG Archer (2004), ''The Loves of Krishna in Indian Painting and Poetry'', Dover, {{ISBN|978-0486433714}}, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yāska]]'s ''[[Nirukta]]'', an etymological dictionary published around the 6th{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BCE, contains a reference to the Shyamantaka jewel in the possession of [[Akrura]], a motif from the well-known Puranic story about Krishna.&lt;ref name = bryant4&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] and ''Aitareya-Aranyaka'' associate Krishna with his Vrishni origins.&lt;ref&gt;Sunil Kumar Bhattacharya ''Krishna-cult in Indian Art''. 1996 M.

[[Megasthenes]], a [[Greek ethnographer]] and an ambassador of [[Seleucus I]] to the court of [[Chandragupta Maurya]] towards the end of 4th{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BCE, made reference to [[Megasthenes' Herakles|Herakles]] in his famous work [[Indica (Megasthenes)|Indica]]. This text is now lost to history, but was quoted in secondary literature by later Greeks such as [[Arrian]], [[Diodorus]], and [[Strabo]].{{sfn|Bryant|2007|p=5}} According to these texts, Megasthenes mentioned that the Sourasenoi tribe of India, who worshipped Herakles, had two major cities named Methora and Kleisobora, and a navigable river named the Jobares. According to [[Edwin Bryant (author)|Edwin Bryant]], a professor of Indian religions known for his publications on Krishna, "there is little doubt that the Sourasenoi refers to the Shurasenas, a branch of the [[Yadu]] dynasty to which Krishna belonged".{{sfn|Bryant|2007|p=5}} The word Herakles, states Bryant, is likely a Greek phonetic equivalent of Hari-Krishna, as is Methora of Mathura, Kleisobora of Krishnapura, and the Jobares of [[Yamuna|Jamuna]]. Later, when [[Alexander the Great]] launched his campaign in the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], his associates recalled that the soldiers of [[King Porus|Porus]] were carrying an image of Herakles.{{sfn|Bryant|2007|p=5}}

The Buddhist [[Pali canon]] and the Ghata-Jâtaka (No. {{nbsp}}454) [[polemic]]ally mention the devotees of Vâsudeva and Baladeva. These texts have many peculiarities and may be a garbled and confused version of the Krishna legends.{{sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=5–6}} The texts of [[Jainism]] mention these tales as well, also with many peculiarities and different versions, in their legends about [[Tirthankara]]s. This inclusion of Krishna-related legends in ancient [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and Jaina literature suggests that Krishna theology was existent and important in the religious landscape observed by non-Hindu traditions of [[Ancient india|ancient India]].{{sfn|Bryant|2007|p=6}}&lt;ref&gt;Hemacandra Abhidhânacintâmani, Ed.

The ancient Sanskrit grammarian [[Patanjali]] in his ''[[Mahabhashya]]'' makes several references to Krishna and his associates found in later Indian texts. In his commentary on Pāṇini's verse 3.1.26, he also uses the word ''Kamsavadha'' or the "killing of Kamsa", an important part of the legends surrounding Krishna.{{sfn|Bryant|2007|p=5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|last=Gopal|first=Madan|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|year=1990|editor=K.S.

Krishna iconography forms an important element in the figural sculpture on 17th–19th century terracotta temples of Bengal. In many temples, the stories of Krishna are depicted on a long series of narrow panels along the base of the facade.

== Life and legends ==
This summary is a mythological account, based on literary details from the ''[[Mahābhārata]]'', the ''[[Harivamsa]]'', the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', and the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]''. The scenes from the narrative are set in ancient India, mostly in the present states of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Haryana]], [[Delhi]], and [[Gujarat]]. The legends about Krishna's life are called ''Krishna charitas'' ([[IAST]]: Kṛṣṇacaritas).{{sfn|Matchett|2001|p=145}}

=== Birth ===
[[File: Indischer Maler um 1755 002.jpg|thumb|right|Baby Krishna on a swing, depicted with his foster parents [[Nanda Baba|Nanda]] and [[Yashoda]].]]

At Devaki's wedding, according to Puranic legends, Kamsa is told by fortune tellers that a child of Devaki would kill him. Sometimes, it is depicted as an [[Akashvani (word)|akashvani]] announcing Kamsa's death. Kamsa arranges to kill all of Devaki's children. When Krishna is born, Vasudeva secretly carries the infant Krishna away across the Yamuna, and exchanges him with [[Yashoda]]'s daughter. When Kamsa tries to kill the newborn, the exchanged baby appears as the Hindu goddess [[Yogmaya|Yogamaya]], warning him that his death has arrived in his kingdom, and then disappears, according to the legends in the Puranas. Krishna grows up with [[Nanda Baba|Nanda]] and his wife, [[Yashoda]], near modern-day [[Mathura]].&lt;ref name="yashoda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/07/sss/ho_1982.220.8.htm|title=Yashoda and Krishna|date=2011-10-10|publisher=Metmuseum.org|access-date=2011-10-23|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013214426/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/07/sss/ho_1982.220.8.htm|archive-date=13 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tkk"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UiwMRwcT-kC |title=The Krishna key|date=2012|publisher=Westland|isbn=978-9381626689|location=Chennai|page=Key7|language=en|last1=Sanghi|first1=Ashwin|access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lok Nath Soni"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wT-BAAAAMAAJ |title=The Cattle and the Stick: An Ethnographic Profile of the Raut of Chhattisgarh|publisher=Anthropological Survey of India, Government of India, Ministry of Tourism and Culture, Department of Culture, 2000 Original from the University of Michigan|year=2000|isbn=978-8185579573|location=Anthropological Survey of India, Government of India, Ministry of Tourism and Culture, Department of Culture, Delhi|pages=16|author=Lok Nath Soni}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Krishna's siblings also survive, namely [[Balarama]] and [[Subhadra]], according to these legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=124–130, 224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day of the birth of Krishna is celebrated as [[Krishna Janmashtami]].

=== Childhood and youth ===
The legends of Krishna's childhood and youth describe him as a cow-herder, a mischievous boy whose pranks earn him the nickname ''Makhan Chor'' (butter thief), and a protector who steals the hearts of the people in both Gokul and Vrindavana. The texts state, for example, that Krishna lifts the [[Govardhana hill]] to protect the inhabitants of Vrindavana from [[Sāṁvartaka|devastating rains and floods]].&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite book|author = Lynne Gibson|title = Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions|publisher = Merriam-Webster|year = 1999|page = 503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other legends describe him as an enchanter and playful lover of the gopis (milkmaids) of Vrindavana, especially [[Radha]]. These metaphor-filled love stories are known as the ''[[Rasa lila]]'' and were romanticized in the poetry of [[Jayadeva]], author of the [[Gita Govinda]]. They are also central to the development of the Krishna [[bhakti]] traditions worshiping [[Radha Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Schweig, G.

Krishna's childhood illustrates the Hindu concept of ''Lila'', playing for fun and enjoyment and not for sport or gain. His interaction with the gopis at the rasa dance or [[Rasa-lila]] is an example. Krishna plays his flute and the gopis come immediately, from whatever they were doing, to the banks of the [[Yamuna River]] and join him in singing and dancing. Even those who could not physically be there join him through meditation. He is the spiritual essence and the love-eternal in existence, the gopis metaphorically represent the ''[[prakṛti]]'' matter and the impermanent body.&lt;ref name="Largen"&gt;{{cite book|author=Largen|first=Kristin Johnston|url=https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/Baby_Krishna_Infant_Christ/D7_gveSP6-sC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0|title=God at Play: Seeing God Through the Lens of the Young Krishna|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1608330188|location=India|pages=|oclc=1030901369}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|256}}

This ''Lila'' is a constant theme in the legends of Krishna's childhood and youth. Even when he is battling with a serpent to protect others, he is described in Hindu texts as if he were playing a game.&lt;ref name=Largen /&gt;{{rp|255}} This quality of playfulness in Krishna is celebrated during festivals as Rasa-Lila and [[Janmashtami]], where Hindus in some regions such as [[Maharashtra]] playfully mimic his legends, such as by making human gymnastic pyramids to break open ''handis'' (clay pots) hung high in the air to "steal" butter or buttermilk, spilling it all over the group.&lt;ref name=Largen /&gt;{{rp|253–261}}

=== Adulthood ===

Krishna legends then describe his return to Mathura. He overthrows and kills the tyrant king, ''his uncle'' Kamsa/Kansa after quelling several assassination attempts by Kamsa. He reinstates Kamsa's father, [[Ugrasena]] as the king of the [[Yadava]]s and becomes a leading prince at the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one version of the Krishna story, as narrated by Shanta Rao, Krishna after Kamsa's death leads the Yadavas to the newly built city of [[Dvārakā|Dwaraka]].

The Bhagavata Purana describes [[Ashtabharya|eight wives]] of Krishna that appear in sequence as [[Rukmini]], [[Satyabhama]], [[Jambavati]], [[Kalindi]], [[Mitravinda]], [[Nagnajiti]] (also called Satya), [[Bhadra (Krishna's wife)|Bhadra]] and [[Lakshmana (Krishna's wife)|Lakshmana]] (also called Madra).&lt;ref name="Hudson2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=D Dennis Hudson|title=The Body of God : An Emperor's Palace for Krishna in Eighth-Century Kanchipuram: An Emperor's Palace for Krishna in Eighth-Century Kanchipuram|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMCxbOezDi4C&amp;pg=PA264|access-date=28 March 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-970902-1|pages=263–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dennis Hudson, this is a metaphor where each of the eight wives signifies a different aspect of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=D Dennis Hudson|title=The Body of God : An Emperor's Palace for Krishna in Eighth-Century Kanchipuram: An Emperor's Palace for Krishna in Eighth-Century Kanchipuram|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMCxbOezDi4C&amp;pg=PA264|access-date=28 March 2013|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-970902-1|pages=102–103, 263–273}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to George Williams, Vaishnava texts mention all Gopis as wives of Krishna, but this is spiritual symbolism of devotional relationship and Krishna's complete loving devotion to each and everyone devoted to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Mason Williams|title=Handbook of Hindu Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7LOZfwCDpEC&amp;pg=PA188|access-date=10 March 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533261-2|pages=188, 222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Krishna-related Hindu traditions, he is most commonly seen with [[Radha]]. All of his wives and his lover Radha are considered in the Hindu tradition to be the [[avatar]]s of the goddess [[Lakshmi]], the consort of Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|2006|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bryant|2007|p=443}} [[Gopi]]s are considered as Lakshmi's or Radha's manifestations.{{sfn|Bryant|2007|p=443}}&lt;ref name=hawley13&gt;{{cite book|title = The Divine Consort: Rādhā and the Goddesses of India|author=John Stratton Hawley, Donna Marie Wulff|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publisher|date= 1982|isbn = 978-0-89581-102-8|page=12}} Quote: "The regional texts vary in the identity of Krishna's wife (consort), some presenting it as Rukmini, some as Radha, some as Svaminiji, some adding all ''gopis'', and some identifying all to be different aspects or manifestation of one [[Devi]] Lakshmi."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kurukshetra War and ''Bhagavad Gita'' ===
{{Main|Kurukshetra War|Bhagavad Gita}}
According to the epic poem ''Mahabharata'', Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the [[Kurukshetra War]], but on the condition that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his ''[[Gandiva]]'' (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, by Robert N. Minor in {{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=77–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D.

=== Death and ascension ===
{{Main|Mausala Parva}}
It is stated in the Indian texts that the legendary Kurukshetra War led to the death of all the hundred sons of Gandhari. After Duryodhana's death, Krishna visits Gandhari to offer his condolences when Gandhari and Dhritarashtra visited Kurukshetra, as stated in Stree Parva. Feeling that Krishna deliberately did not put an end to the war, in a fit of rage and sorrow, Gandhari said, "Thou were indifferent to the Kurus and the Pandavas whilst they slew each other. Therefore, O Govinda, thou shalt be the slayer of thy own kinsmen!" According to the ''Mahabharata'', a fight breaks out at a festival among the Yadavas, who end up killing each other. Mistaking the sleeping Krishna for a deer, a hunter named Jara shoots an arrow towards Krishna's foot that fatally injures him. Krishna forgives ''Jara'' and dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eck380&gt;{{cite book|author=Diana L.

There are numerous versions of Krishna's life story, of which three are most studied: the ''Harivamsa'', the ''Bhagavata Purana'', and the ''Vishnu Purana''.{{sfn|Matchett|2001|pp=9–14, 145–149}} They share the basic storyline but vary significantly in their specifics, details, and styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamín Preciado-Solís|title=The Kṛṣṇa Cycle in the Purāṇas: Themes and Motifs in a Heroic Saga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvCaWvjGDVEC&amp;pg=PA40 |year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-0-89581-226-1|page=40}}, Quote: "Within a period of four or five centuries [around the start of the common era], we encounter our major sources of information, all in different versions. The Mahabharata, the Harivamsa, the Visnu Purana, the Ghata Jataka, and the Bala Carita all appear between the first and the fifth century AD, and each of them represents a tradition of a Krsna cycle different from the others".&lt;/ref&gt; The most original composition, the ''Harivamsa'' is told in a realistic style that describes Krishna's life as a poor herder but weaves in poetic and [[Allusion|allusive]] fantasy. It ends on a triumphal note, not with the death of Krishna.{{sfn|Matchett|2001|pp=44–49, 63–64, 145}} Differing in some details, the fifth book of the ''Vishnu Purana'' moves away from ''Harivamsa'' realism and embeds Krishna in mystical terms and eulogies.{{sfn|Matchett|2001|pp=89–104, 146}} The ''Vishnu Purana'' manuscripts exist in many versions.{{sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=18, 245–249}}

The tenth and eleventh books of the ''Bhagavata Purana'' are widely considered to be a poetic masterpiece, full of imagination and metaphors, with no relation to the realism of pastoral life found in the ''Harivamsa''. Krishna's life is presented as a cosmic play (''Lila''), where his youth is set as a princely life with his foster father Nanda portrayed as a king.{{sfn|Matchett|2001|pp=108–115, 146–147}} Krishna's life is closer to that of a human being in ''Harivamsa'', but is a symbolic universe in the ''Bhagavata Purana'', where Krishna is within the universe and beyond it, as well as the universe itself, always.{{sfn|Matchett|2001|pp=145–149}} The ''Bhagavata Purana'' manuscripts also exist in many versions, in numerous Indian languages.{{sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=138–149}}{{sfn|Bryant|2007|p=112}}

According to Guy Beck, "most scholars of Hinduism and Indian history accept the historicity of Krishna{{snd}}that he was a real male person, whether human or divine, who lived on Indian soil by at least 1000 BCE and interacted with many other historical persons within the cycles of the epic and puranic histories."

According to mythologies in the Jain tradition, Krishna was a cousin of Neminatha.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=104}} Neminatha is believed in the Jain tradition to have been born 84,000 years before the 9th-century{{nbsp}}BCE [[Parshvanatha]], the twenty-third ''tirthankara''.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=226}}

A wide range of theological and philosophical ideas are presented through Krishna in Hindu texts. The teachings of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' can be considered, according to [[Friedhelm Hardy]], as the first Krishnaite system of theology.{{sfn|Hardy|1987|pp=387–392}}

The ''Bhagavata Purana'', a popular text on Krishna considered to be like scripture in [[Assam]], synthesizes an Advaita, Samkhya, and Yoga framework for Krishna but one that proceeds through loving devotion to Krishna. {{sfn|Sheridan|1986|pp=1–2, 17–25}}{{sfn|Kumar Das|2006| pages=172–173}}{{sfn|Brown|1983|pages=553–557}} Bryant describes the synthesis of ideas in Bhagavata Purana as,

While Sheridan and Pintchman both affirm Bryant's view, the latter adds that the Vedantic view emphasized in the Bhagavata is [[nondualism|non-dualist]] with a difference.

=== Vaishnavism ===
{{Main|Vaishnavism|Krishnaism}}
The worship of Krishna is part of [[Vaishnavism]], a major tradition within Hinduism.

Their theologies are generally centered either on Vishnu or an avatar such as Krishna as supreme. The terms [[Krishnaism]] and Vishnuism have sometimes been used to distinguish the two, the former implying that Krishna is the transcendent Supreme Being. {{sfn|Flood|1996|p =117}} Some scholars, as [[Friedhelm Hardy]], do not define Krishnaism as a sub-order or offshoot of Vaishnavism, considering it a parallel and no less ancient current of Hinduism.{{sfn|Hardy|1987|pp=387–392}}

'''Early traditions'''

The deity ''[[Krishna-Vasudeva]]'' (''{{IAST|kṛṣṇa vāsudeva}}'' "Krishna, the son of [[Vasudeva Anakadundubhi]]") is historically one of the earliest forms of worship in [[Krishnaism]] and [[Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref name="Cultofgopal"&gt;{{cite journal|title = A Revolution in {{IAST|Kṛṣṇaism}}: The Cult of Gopāla |last = Hein|first = Norvin|jstor = 1062622 |volume=25 |issue = 4|pages=296–317 |doi=10.1086/463051 |journal=History of Religions |year=1986|s2cid = 162049250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = bryant4 /&gt; It is believed to be a significant tradition of the early history of Krishna religion in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, Gouriswar: ''Vanamala of Vasudeva-Krsna-Visnu and Sankarsana-Balarama''.

==== Indian subcontinent ====
The bhakti movements devoted to Krishna became prominent in southern India in the 7th to 9th{{nbsp}}centuries CE.

The movement originated in South India during the 7th century CE, spreading northwards from Tamil Nadu through Karnataka and Maharashtra; by the 15th{{nbsp}}century, it was established in Bengal and northern India.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=1–2|ps=}} Early [[Krishnaism|Krishnaite]] Bhakti pioneers included [[Nimbarkacharya]] (12th or 13th{{nbsp}}century CE),{{sfn|Ramnarace|2014|p=}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nimbarka-Indian-philosopher Nimbarka], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|"The first ''Kṛṣṇaite sampradāya'' was developed by Nimbārka."{{sfn|Hardy|1987|pp=387–392}}}} but most emerged later, including [[Vallabhacharya]] (15th{{nbsp}}century CE) and [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]. They started their own schools, namely [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]], [[Vallabha Sampradaya]], and [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], with Krishna and Radha as the supreme gods. In addition, since the 15th century, flourished [[Tantra|Tantric]] variety of Krishnaism, [[Vaishnava-Sahajiya]], is linked to the Bengali poet [[Chandidas]].{{sfn|Basu|1932}}

In the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], particularly in [[Maharashtra]], saint poets of the [[Warkari]] sect such as [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Namdev]], [[Janabai]], [[Eknath]], and [[Tukaram]] promoted the worship of [[Vithoba]],&lt;ref name="vithoba" /&gt; a local form of Krishna, from between the 13th to 18th century.&lt;ref name=" Mahony1987" /&gt; Before the Warkari tradition, Krishna devotion became well established in Maharashtra due to the rise of the [[Mahanubhava|Mahanubhava Sampradaya]] founded by Sarvajna [[Chakradhar Swami|Chakradhara]].&lt;ref&gt;The religious system of the Mahānubhāva sect, by Anne Feldhaus, Manohar publications: Delhi, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pranami|Pranami Sampradaya]] emerged in the 17th century in [[Gujarat]], based on the Krishna-focussed syncretist Hindu-[[Islam]]ic teachings of Devchandra Maharaj and his famous successor, Mahamati Prannath.{{sfn|Toffin|2012|pp=249–254}} In southern India, [[Purandara Dasa]] and [[Kanakadasa]] of [[Karnataka]] composed songs devoted to the Krishna image of [[Udupi]]. [[Rupa Goswami]] of Gaudiya Vaishnavism has compiled a comprehensive summary of bhakti called Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier1974" /&gt;

In South India, the acharyas of the Sri Sampradaya have written reverently about Krishna in most of their works, including the [[Thiruppavai]] by Andal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thiruppavai|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/tpv/|work=Ibiblio|access-date=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gopala Vimshati by [[Vedanta Desika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Desika|first=Vedanta|title=Gopala Vimshati|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/vdesikan/gopala_vimsati/index.html|work=Ibiblio, Sripedia|access-date=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Outside Asia ====
[[File:Radhakrishna manor.JPG|thumb|upright|Krishna (left) with Radha at [[Bhaktivedanta Manor]], [[Watford]], England]]
By 1965, the ''Krishna-bhakti'' movement had spread outside India after [[Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] (as instructed by his [[guru]], [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura]]) travelled from his homeland in West Bengal to [[New York City]]. A year later, in 1966, after gaining many followers, he was able to form the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), popularly known as the Hare Krishna movement. The purpose of this movement was to write about Krishna in English and to share the [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] philosophy with people in the Western world by spreading the teachings of the saint [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]. In the biographies of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the mantra he received when he was given [[diksha]] or initiation in [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] was the six-word verse of the ''[[Kali-Saṇṭāraṇa Upaniṣad|Kali-Santarana Upanishad]]'', namely "Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare; Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare". In the Gaudiya tradition, it is the ''maha-mantra'', or great mantra, about Krishna [[bhakti]].{{sfn|Bryant|2013|p=42}}&lt;ref&gt;Alanna Kaivalya (2014), Sacred Sound: Discovering the Myth and Meaning of Mantra and Kirtan, New World, {{ISBN|978-1608682430}}, pp. 153–154&lt;/ref&gt; Its chanting was known as ''hari-nama sankirtana''.&lt;ref&gt;''Srila Prabhupada – He Built a House in which the whole world can live in peace'', Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami, Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, 1984, {{ISBN|0-89213-133-0}} p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;

The Krishna stories have played a key role in the history of Indian theatre, music, and dance, particularly through the tradition of [[Rasa leela|''Rasaleela'']]. These are dramatic enactments of Krishna's childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. One common scene involves Krishna playing flute in Rasa Leela, only to be heard by certain gopis (cowherd maidens), which is theologically supposed to represent divine call only heard by certain enlightened beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vemsani |first1=Lavanya |title=Krishna in history thought and culture |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4fw2DAAAQBAJ |year=2016 |publisher=ABC-Clio LLC|location=California |language=en |isbn=978-1-61069-210-6|pages=179–180 |chapter=Music and Krishna }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the text's legends have inspired secondary theatre literature such as the eroticism in [[Gita Govinda]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham Schweig (2007), ''Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions'' (Editor: Yudit Kornberg Greenberg), Volume{{nbsp}}1, {{ISBN|978-1851099801}}, pp. 247–249&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishna-related literature such as the ''Bhagavata Purana'' accords a metaphysical significance to the performances and treats them as a religious ritual, infusing daily life with spiritual meaning, thus representing a good, honest, happy life. Similarly, Krishna-inspired performances aim to cleanse the hearts of faithful actors and listeners. Singing, dancing, and performing any part of ''Krishna Lila'' is an act of remembering the dharma in the text, as a form of ''para bhakti'' (supreme devotion). To remember Krishna at any time and in any art, asserts the text, is to worship the good and the divine.{{sfn|Varadpande|1987|pages=95–97}}

Classical dance styles such as [[Kathak]], [[Odissi dance|Odissi]], [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]], [[Kuchipudi]] and [[Bharatanatyam]] in particular are known for their Krishna-related performances.{{sfn|Varadpande|1987|page=98}} [[Krisnattam]] (Krishnattam) traces its origins to Krishna legends, and is linked to another major classical Indian dance form called [[Kathakali]].&lt;ref name=Zarrilli2000&gt;{{cite book|author = Zarrilli, P.

=== Jainism ===
The [[Jainism]] tradition lists 63 ''[[Śalākāpuruṣa]]'' or notable figures which, amongst others, includes the twenty-four ''[[Tirthankara]]s'' (spiritual teachers) and nine sets of triads. One of these triads is Krishna as the ''Vasudeva'', [[Balarama]] as the ''[[Balabhadra|Baladeva]]'', and [[Jarasandha]] as the ''Prati-Vasudeva''. In each age of the Jain cyclic time is born a ''Vasudeva'' with an elder brother termed the ''Baladeva''.  Between the triads, ''Baladeva'' upholds the principle of non-violence, a central idea of Jainism. The villain is the ''Prati-vasudeva'', who attempts to destroy the world. To save the world, ''Vasudeva-Krishna'' has to forsake the non-violence principle and kill the ''Prati-Vasudeva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Jaini|first=P. S.|author-link=Padmanabh Jaini|date=1993|title=Jaina Puranas: A Puranic Counter Tradition|isbn=978-0-7914-1381-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kZFzHCuiFAC&amp;pg=PA207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stories of these triads can be found in the ''[[Harivamsa Purana]]'' (8th{{nbsp}}century CE) of [[Jinasena]] (not be confused with its namesake, the addendum to ''Mahābhārata'') and the ''Trishashti-shalakapurusha-charita'' of [[Hemachandra]].{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=26}}&lt;ref name = Jer&gt;See Jerome H. Bauer "Hero of Wonders, Hero in Deeds: [https://books.google.com/books?id=0SJ73GHSCF8C&amp;pg=PA151 "Vasudeva Krishna in Jaina Cosmohistory]" in {{Harvnb|Beck|2005|pp=167–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Krishna's life in the ''Puranas'' of Jainism follows the same general outline as those in the Hindu texts, but in details, they are very different: they include Jain ''Tirthankaras'' as characters in the story, and generally are polemically critical of Krishna, unlike the versions found in the ''Mahabharata'', the ''Bhagavata Purana'', and the ''Vishnu Purana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Cort| first=J. E.|date=1993|editor=Wendy Doniger|title=An Overview of the Jaina Puranas, in Purana Perennis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kZFzHCuiFAC&amp;pg=PA191 |pages=220–233 |isbn=978-1-4384-0136-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Krishna loses battles in the Jain versions, and his ''gopis'' and his clan of Yadavas die in a fire created by an ascetic named Dvaipayana. Similarly, after dying from the hunter Jara's arrow, the Jaina texts state Krishna goes to the [[Naraka (Jainism)|third hell]] in [[Jain cosmology]], while his brother is said to go to the [[Svarga (Jainism)|sixth heaven]].&lt;ref name="Glasenapp1999p317"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helmuth von Glasenapp|title=Jainism: An Indian Religion of Salvation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzEzXDk0v6sC&amp;pg=PA317 |year=1999|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1376-2|pages=316–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vimalasuri is attributed to be the author of the Jain version of the ''Harivamsa Purana'', but no manuscripts have been found that confirm this. It is likely that later Jain scholars, probably Jinasena of the 8th{{nbsp}}century, wrote a complete version of Krishna legends in the Jain tradition and credited it to the ancient Vimalasuri.&lt;ref name=Cort1993&gt;{{citation|last=Cort| first=J.

In other Jain texts, Krishna is stated to be a cousin of the twenty-second ''Tirthankara'', Neminatha. The Jain texts state that Neminatha taught Krishna all the wisdom that he later gave to Arjuna in the ''Bhagavad Gita''. According to [[Jeffery D. Long]], a professor of religion known for his publications on Jainism, this connection between Krishna and Neminatha has been a historic reason for Jains to accept, read, and cite the ''Bhagavad Gita'' as a spiritually important text, celebrate Krishna-related festivals, and intermingle with Hindus as spiritual cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D.

The story of Krishna occurs in the [[Jataka]] tales in [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.vipassana.info/ay/andhakavenhu_puttaa.htm|title = Andhakavenhu Puttaa|publisher = www.vipassana.info|access-date = 15 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Vidhurapandita Jataka'' mentions ''Madhura'' (Sanskrit: Mathura), the ''Ghata Jataka'' mentions Kamsa, Devagabbha (Sk: Devaki), Upasagara or Vasudeva, Govaddhana (Sk: Govardhana), Baladeva (Balarama), and Kanha or Kesava (Sk: Krishna, Keshava).&lt;ref name=Law1941&gt;{{cite book|author = Law, B.

Like the Jaina versions of the Krishna legends, the Buddhist versions such as one in ''Ghata Jataka'' follow the general outline of the story,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G.P. Malalasekera|title=Dictionary of Pali Proper Names|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=x8ObMQ1GGsUC&amp;pg=PA439|year=2003|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-1823-7|page=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are different from the Hindu versions as well.&lt;ref name=Law1941 /&gt;{{sfn|Bryant|2007|p=6}} For example, the Buddhist legend describes Devagabbha (Devaki) to have been isolated in a palace built upon a pole after she is born, so no future husband could reach her. Krishna's father similarly is described as a powerful king, but who meets up with Devagabbha anyway, and to whom Kamsa gives away his sister Devagabbha in marriage. The siblings of Krishna are not killed by Kamsa, though he tries. In the Buddhist version of the legend, all of Krishna's siblings grow to maturity.&lt;ref name= Francis314 /&gt;

Krishna and his siblings' capital becomes Dvaravati. The Arjuna and Krishna interaction is missing in the Jataka version. A new legend is included, wherein Krishna laments in uncontrollable sorrow when his son dies, and a Ghatapandita feigns madness to teach Krishna a lesson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera|title=Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names: A-Dh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=up5O9zrSX80C&amp;pg=PA825 |year=2007|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3021-9|pages=825–826}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jataka tale also includes internecine destruction among his siblings after they all get drunk. Krishna also dies in the Buddhist legend by the hand of a hunter named Jara, but while he is traveling to a frontier city. Mistaking Krishna for a pig, Jara throws a spear that fatally pierces his feet, causing Krishna great pain and then his death.&lt;ref name= Francis314&gt;{{cite book|author1=H. T. Francis|author2=E.

At the end of this ''Ghata-Jataka'' discourse, the Buddhist text declares that [[Sariputta]], one of the revered disciples of the Buddha in the Buddhist tradition, was incarnated as Krishna in his previous life to learn lessons on grief from the Buddha in his prior rebirth:

{{Blockquote|Then he [Master] declared the Truths and identified the Birth: "At that time, Ananda was Rohineyya, Sariputta was Vasudeva [Krishna], the followers of the Buddha were the other persons, and I myself was Ghatapandita."|Jataka Tale No. 454|Translator: W.

In [[Hinduism]], '''Dhata''' or '''Dhatri''' is the name of the [[solar deity]], one of the [[Adityas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Original Sanskrit Texts on the Origin and History of the People of India, Their Religion and Institutions, Volume 2 |page=106|author=John Muir}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mani232"&gt;Mani p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lochtefeld|first=James G.|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 1|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc|year=2001l|isbn=978-0-8239-3179-8|language=en|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also a god of health and magic. He is invoked in [[tantra]] by drawing tantras and chanting [[Vedas|Vedic]] [[hymn]]s. Often invoked during major [[yagna]]s such as [[Ashwamedha]] yagna.

Dhata is evidenced as an Aditya in both Hindu epics - the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and the ''[[Ramayana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mani p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; He is described to fought [[Arjuna]] and [[Krishna]] in burning of [[Khandava Forest]] episode in the epic ''Mahabharata''.&lt;ref name="Mani232"/&gt; The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' also mentions Dhata as the seventh son of Aditi and Kashyapa. In this text, he has four wives — Kuhu, [[Sinivali]], [[Raka]] and [[Anumati (deity)|Anumati]] — who gave birth to his sons — Sayam, Darsha, Pratar and Purnamasa respectively.&lt;ref name = "BhP" &gt;[https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-bhagavata-purana/d/doc1127162.html#note-t-190332 Bhagavata Purana,  Book 6 - Sixth Skandha, Chapter 18]&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Agni Purana]]'', he is associated with the zodiac of Cancer and the colour yellow.&lt;ref&gt;Mani p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

During his incarnation on earth, he reigned as the King of Kashi, today locally referred to as [[Varanasi]]. Dhanvantari is also identified as the great-grandfather of [[Divodasa]], a mythological King of Kashi in the [[Vishnu Purana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gray |first=Louis H. |date=1922 |title=The Indian God Dhanvantari |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/593645 |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=42 |pages=323–337 |doi=10.2307/593645 |jstor=593645 |issn=0003-0279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2014-08-30 |title=Lineage of Ayu and origin of Dhanvantari [Chapter VIII] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/vishnu-purana-wilson/d/doc116005.html |access-date=2022-08-02 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconography ==
[[File:Godofayurveda.jpg|thumb|Painting of Dhanvantari.]]
According to the ancient [[Sanskrit]] work ''Vishnudharamottara'', Dhanvantari is a handsome individual and is to usually be depicted with [[Chaturbhuja|four hands]], with one or two of them carrying a bowl of [[amrita]], the elixir of immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stutley |first=Margaret |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQWQDwAAQBAJ&amp;newbks=0&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=PT123&amp;dq=dhanvantri+iconography&amp;hl=en |title=The Illustrated Dictionary of Hindu Iconography |date=2019-04-09 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-429-62425-4 |pages=123 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhanvantari is depicted in a stark resemblance to Vishnu, with four hands, holding the [[shankha]], [[chakra]], jalauka (leech), and a pot containing amrita. He is often shown with a leech in his hand rather than the scriptures, indicating the historical practice of [[bloodletting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lad |first=Vasant |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJIeAQAAIAAJ&amp;newbks=0&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dhanvantari+leech&amp;q=dhanvantari+leech&amp;hl=en |title=Textbook of Ayurveda |date=2002 |publisher=Ayurvedic Press |isbn=978-1-883725-07-5 |pages=119 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some texts describe him as holding a conch, [[amrita]], medicinal herbs, and a book of [[Ayurveda]].

== Legend ==

=== Origin ===
''The [[Balakanda|Bala Kanda]]'' of the ''[[Ramayana]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Valmiki Ramayana: Balakanda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=glKDtKF8XOIC|page=556|author=Harekrishna Satapathy|publisher=Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' state that Dhanvantari emerged from the [[Ocean of Milk]] and appeared with the pot of [[amrita]] (elixir of immortality) during the ''[[Samudra manthan|Samudra Mathana]],'' whilst the ocean was being churned by the [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s and the [[asura]]s, using the [[Mount Mandara|Mandara]] mountain and the serpent [[Vasuki]]. The pot of amrita was snatched by the asuras, and after this event, Vishnu's avatar, [[Mohini]], appears and takes the nectar back from the asuras. It is also believed that Dhanvantari promulgated the practice of Ayurveda.&lt;ref name="M107"&gt;[[#Madhavan|Madhavan 2007]], p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Of special mention here is the treatise of ''Dhanvantari-Nighantu'', which completely elucidates Dhanvantari's medicinal plants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/studies-on-medicinal-planets-and-drugs-in-dhanvantari-nighantu-two-volumes-NAD479/][http://www.saujanyabooks.com/details.aspx?id=34040][https://www.scribd.com/doc/290274952/dhanvantari-nighantu-pdf][http://www.vaidyaraj-ayurveda.com/dhanvantari.html][https://docslide.us/documents/dhanvantari-nighantupdf.html][https://www.amazon.in/Dhanvantari-Nighantu-Sanskrit-Text-English-Translation/dp/8189469126 Dhanvantari-Nighantu]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brahmanda Purana]] describes the origin of the physician deity:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2019-06-21 |title=The origin of Dhanvantari [Chapter 67] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brahmanda-purana/d/doc362925.html |access-date=2022-08-02 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Blockquote|text=Let the origin of Dhanvantari be heard, O Brāhmaṇas. He was born formerly when the ocean was being churned, for the sake of nectar. At the outset, he was born before the Kalaśa (pot). He was encircled by a halo of glory all round. On seeing him having accomplished his task suddenly, Viṣṇu who was standing by said—“You are born of water”. Hence, he is remembered as Abja (water-born). Abja said to Viṣṇu—“O lord, I am your son. Allot me my share and place in the world, O excellent god.”


On being told thus, the lord said after review in the factual position, “The division of the Yajña has already been made by the sons of Diti as well as the Suras. The due performance of Homas etc. has been laid down in the Vedas by the great sages. It is not possible to get Homa performed unto you at any time. As you are born subsequent to Vedas O god, you have no Mantra (assignable to you). O lord, in your second incarnation you will earn reputation in the world. Then you will attain the super-natural powers like Aṇimā (minuteness) and others. O lord, you will attain Deva-hood with this selfsame body. Brāhmaṇas (and other twice-born ones) shall worship you with Caturmantras (i.e. Mantras from the four Vedas), ghee offerings and Gavyas (materials of worship obtained from milk, milk products). You will once again reproduce the Āyurveda (the Science of Medicine). These incidents and events are inevitable and have already been visualised by the lotus-born lord (Brahmā) earlier. Undoubtedly you will be born in the second Dvāpara Yuga”. Therefore, after granting the boon, Viṣṇu disappeared.|title=[[Brahmanda Purana]]|source=Chapter 67}}

=== Incarnation ===
During the second Dvapara Yuga, the King of Kashi, Dirghatapas, propitiated the physician deity for the birth of a son. The deity agreed to incarnate himself as the desired child as a boon. Dhanavantri proved to be a great king, and is described as the "dispeller of all ailments". He is described to have been exempt from infirmities and recognised as a "master of universal knowledge".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The sage [[Bharadvaja]] educated him regarding the therapeutic practice of Ayurveda, and further caused him to study medicine. The king created a classification of his knowledge of medicine into eight fields and disseminated it to a number of diverse disciples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2019-06-21 |title=The origin of Dhanvantari [Chapter 67] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brahmanda-purana/d/doc362925.html |access-date=2022-08-02 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Dhanvantari and Manasa ===
According to the [[Brahma Vaivarta Purana]], Dhanvantari, accompanied by his disciples, once journeyed to [[Mount Kailash|Kailasha]]. On the way, a [[Nāga|naga]] named [[Takshaka]] emitted a venom-spitting hiss. A disciple plucked the diamond upon the head of Takshaka and hurled it towards the earth. Upon learning these events, the powerful serpent-king [[Vasuki]] amassed thousands of serpents under the leadership of Drona, Pundarika, and Dhananjaya against the entourage. The poisonous emissions of all these serpents united to make the disciples of Dhanvantari faint. Immediately, Dhanvantari concocted a medicine made from ''vanaspati'', allowing his followers to recover and causing the snakes to faint in turn. When Vasuki understood what had transpired, he sent a [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] serpent goddess, [[Manasa]], to face Dhanvantari. Manasa sent the disciples of Dhanvantari into a swoon, but since the deity was proficient in the art of ''Vishvavidya'', he soon restored his disciples to consciousness. When Manasa deemed it impossible to defeat Dhanvantari or his disciples, she held the [[trishula]] given to her by Shiva and aimed it at Dhanvantari. Seeing this, [[Shiva]] and [[Brahma]] appeared before them and restored the peace, sending them all on their way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2019-01-28 |title=Story of Dhanvantari |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/compilation/puranic-encyclopaedia/d/doc241541.html |access-date=2022-08-02 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend ==
According to the Mahabharata, a conference once took place among the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] and Chandra, where it was proposed that Varchas be incarnated on earth for the destruction of wicked men. Chandra did not wish to be separated from his beloved son, but consented to the proposition, on the condition that Varchas would not leave him for more than sixteen years. Accordingly, during the [[Dvapara Yuga]], Varchas was born as [[Abhimanyu]], the son of the [[Pandava]] prince, [[Arjuna]], and the [[Yadu dynasty|Yadava]] princess, [[Subhadra]]. Abhimanyu was slain when he was sixteen fighting in the [[Kurukshetra War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mani |first=Vettam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mvXsDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Varcas+Abhimanyu&amp;pg=PR1 |title=Puranic Encyclopedia: A Comprehensive Work with Special Reference to the Epic and Puranic Literature |date=2015-01-01 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0597-2 |pages=1 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Garg |first=Gaṅgā Rām |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&amp;dq=Varcas+Abhimanyu&amp;pg=PA107 |title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World |date=1992 |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |isbn=978-81-7022-374-0 |pages=107 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chandra''' ({{lang-sa|चन्द्र|Candra|shining' or 'moon}}), also known as '''Soma''' ({{lang-sa|सोम}}), is the [[Hindu god]] of the Moon, and is associated with the night, plants and vegetation. He is one of the [[Navagraha]] (nine planets of Hinduism) and [[Dikpala]] (guardians of the directions).{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=394}}

==Etymology and other names==
[[File:Howling at the Moon in Mississauga.jpg|left|thumb|The scriptures compare the Moon to a white goose in the blue lake of sky.{{sfn|Edward Washburn Hopkins|1968|p=90}}]]
The word "Chandra" literally means "bright, shining or glittering" and is used for the "[[Moon]]" in [[Sanskrit]] and other [[India]]n languages.{{sfn|Monier-Williams|1872|p=315}}&lt;ref name="eWilhelm51"&gt;''Graha Sutras'' by Ernst Wilhelm, published by Kala Occult Publishers {{ISBN|0-9709636-4-5}} p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of various other figures in Hindu mythology, including an asura and a [[Solar dynasty|Suryavanshi]] king.{{sfn|Mani|1975|p=171}} It is also a common Indian name and surname. Both male and female name variations exists in many South Asian languages that originate from Sanskrit.

Some of the synonyms of Chandra include ''Soma'' (distill), ''Indu'' (bright drop), ''Atrisuta'' (son of Atri), ''Shashin'' or ''Shachin'' (marked by hare), ''Taradhipa'' (lord of stars) and ''Nishakara'' (the night maker), ''Nakshatrapati'' (lord of the [[Nakshatra]]), ''Oshadhipati'' (lord of herbs), ''Uduraj or Udupati'' (water lord), ''Kumudanatha'' (lord of lotuses) and ''Udupa'' (boat).{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=394}}{{sfn|Edward Washburn Hopkins|1968|p=90}}
===Soma===
Soma is one of the most common other names used for the deity; but the earliest use of the word to refer to the Moon is a subject of scholarly debate. Some scholars state that the word Soma is occasionally used for the Moon in the Vedas, while other scholars suggest that such usage emerged only in the post-Vedic literature.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=393}} 

In the [[Vedas]], the word Soma is primarily used for an intoxicating and energizing/healing plant [[Soma (drink)|drink]] and the deity representating it.&lt;ref name="Dalal2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dalal|first=Roshen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNmfdAKFpkQC&amp;q=Soma|title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths|date=2010|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-341517-6|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In post-Vedic [[Hindu]] mythology, Soma is used for Chandra, who is associated with the moon and the plant.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=393}}&lt;ref&gt;Nirukta, Chapter 11, Part 3. The oldest available book for Vedic Etymology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RgVeda 9.1.1, Samaveda 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu texts state that the Moon is lit and nourished by the Sun, and that it is Moon where the divine nectar of immortality resides.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=394}} In Puranas, Soma is sometimes also used to refer to [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]] (as ''Somanatha''), [[Yama]] and [[Kubera]].&lt;ref name=mmw1137&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press (Reprint: 2001)|page=1137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some Indian texts, Soma is the name of an [[apsara]]; alternatively it is the name of any medicinal concoction, or rice-water gruel, or heaven and sky, as well as the name of certain places of pilgrimage.&lt;ref name=mmw1137/&gt;

==Literature==
[[File:The Moon God Chandra (possibly) in His Chariot with Wife and Attendant, 2nd-1st century BCE, Shunga period, West Bengal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Possible depiction of the Moon God Chandra in his chariot with wife and attendant, 2nd-1st century BCE, [[Shunga period]], West Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/65010 |website=www.metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The origin of Soma is traced back to the Hindu [[Vedic texts]], where he is the personification of [[Soma (drink)|a drink made from a plant with the same name]]. Scholars state that the plant had an important role in Vedic civilization and thus, the deity was one of the most important gods of the pantheon. In these Vedic texts, Soma is praised as the lord of plants and forests; the king of rivers and earth; and the father of the gods. The entire [[Mandala 9]] of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' is dedicated to Soma, both the plant and the deity.{{sfn|Stephanie Jamison|2015|p=80}} The identification of Soma as a lunar deity in the Vedic texts is a controversial topic among scholars.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=393}} According to William J. Wilkins, "In later years the name Soma was [.....] given to the moon. How and why this change took place is not known; but in the later of the Vedic hymns there is some evidence of the transition.{{refn|group=note|Wilkins states, "In the following passage Soma seems to be used in both senses — as god of the intoxicating juice, and as the moon ruling through the night. "By Soma the Adityas are strong ; by Soma the earth is great ; and Soma is placed in the midst of the stars. When they crush the plant, he who drinks regards it as Soma. Of him whom the priests regard as Soma (the moon) no one drinks." In another passage this prayer is found : "May the god Soma, he whom they call the Moon, free me.....Soma is the moon, the food of the gods. The sun has the nature of Agni, the moon of Soma."}}{{sfn|Wilkins|1913|p=73}}

In post Vedic texts like the ''[[Ramayana]]'', the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and the ''[[Puranas]]'', Soma is mentioned as a lunar deity and has many epithets including Chandra.{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=104}}{{sfn|Dowson|1870|p=301}} According to most of these texts, Chandra, along with his brothers [[Dattatreya]] and [[Durvasa]], were the sons of the sage [[Atri]] and his wife [[Anasuya]]. The ''[[Devi Bhagvata Purana|Devi Bhagavata Purana]]'' states Chandra to be the [[avatar]] of the creator god [[Brahma]].{{sfn|Mani|1975|p=171}} Some texts contain varying accounts regarding Chandra's birth. According to one text, he is the son of [[Dharma]]; while another mention Prabhakar as his father.{{sfn|Dowson|1870|p=301}} Many legends about Chandra are told in the scriptures.

[[File:Chandra deva.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Chandra, British Museum, 13th century, Konark]]
In one version of the puranas, Chandra and [[Tara (Hindu goddess)|Tara]]—the star goddess and the wife of devas' guru [[Brihaspati]]—fell in love with each another. He abducted her and made her his queen. [[Brihaspati]], after multiple failed peace missions and threats, declared war against Chandra. The Devas sided with their teacher, while [[Shukra]], an enemy of Brihaspati and the teacher of [[Asura]]s, aided Chandra. After the intervention of Brahma stopped the war, Tara, pregnant, was returned to her husband. She later gave birth to a son named [[Budha]], but there was a controversy over the paternity of the child; with both Chandra and Brihaspati claiming themselves as his father. Brahma once again interfered and questioned Tara, who eventually confirmed Chandra as the father of Budha. Budha's son was [[Pururava]]s who established the [[Chandravanshi|Chandravamsha]] Dynasty.{{sfn|Mani|1975|p=171}}{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=393}}

Chandra married 27 daughters of [[Prajapati]] [[Daksha]] — [[Ashvini]], [[Bharani]], [[Kṛttikā|Krittika]], [[Rohini (goddess)|Rohini]], [[Mrigashīrsha|Mrigashiras]], Ardra, [[Punarvasu]], [[Pushya]], [[Ashlesha]], [[Nakshatra|Magha]], [[Pūrva Phalgunī|Pūrvaphalguni]], [[Uttara Phalgunī|Uttaraphalguni]],
[[Hasta (nakshatra)|Hasta]], [[Chitra (nakshatra)|Chitra]], [[Svati]], [[Vishākhā|Vishakha]], [[Anuradha (nakshatra)|Anuradha]], [[Jyeshtha (nakshatra)|Jyeshtha]],
[[Mula (nakshatra)|Mula]], [[Pūrva Ashādhā|Purvashadha]], [[Uttara Ashadha|Uttarashadha]], [[Shravana]], [[Dhanishta]],
[[Shatabhisha]], [[Purva Bhadrapada|Purvabhadrapada]], [[Uttara Bhadrapada|Uttarabhadrapada]],
[[Revati (nakshatra)|Revati]].{{sfn|Mani|1975|p=171}} They all represent one of the 27 [[Nakshatra]] or constellations near the moon. Among all of his 27 wives, Chandra loved Rohini the most and spent most of his time with her. The 26 other wives became upset and complained to Daksha who placed a curse on Chandra. &lt;!--The curse was overcome only after Chandra devoted himself to Shiva, who partially released him from the curse.--&gt;{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=393}}

According to another legend, [[Ganesha]] was returning home on his mount Krauncha (a shrew) late on a full moon night after a mighty feast given by [[Kubera]]. On the journey back, a snake crossed their path and frightened by it, his mount ran away dislodging Ganesha in the process. An overstuffed Ganesha fell to the ground on his stomach, vomiting out all the [[Modak|Modaks]] he had eaten. On observing this, Chandra laughed at Ganesha. Ganesha lost his temper and broke off one of his tusks and flung it straight at the Moon, hurting him, and cursed him so that he would never be whole again. Therefore, It is forbidden to behold Chandra on [[Ganesh Chaturthi]]. This legend accounts for the Moon's waxing and waning including a big crater on the Moon, a dark spot, visible even from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Usha|first1=K R|title=Why Ganesha has a Broken Tusk or Why the Moon has a Crater|url=https://iwp.uiowa.edu/silkroutes/city/bangalore-india/text/cultural-lens-childrens-stories-why-ganesha|website=The University of Iowa|access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
Soma's iconography varies in Hindu texts. The most common is one where he is a white-coloured deity, holding a mace in his hand, riding a chariot with three wheels and three or more white horses (up to ten).{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=394}}

Soma as the Moon-deity is also found in [[Buddhism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John C. Huntington|author2=Dina Bangdel|title=The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3KmWbcq5foC |year=2003|publisher=Serindia|isbn=978-1-932476-01-9 |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=R. T. Vyas|author2=Umakant Premanand Shah|title=Studies in Jaina Art and Iconography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fETebHcHKogC&amp;pg=PA23 |year=1995|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-316-8|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zodiac and calendar==
Soma is the root of the word ''Somavara'' or [[Monday]] in the Hindu calendar.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=89}} The word "Monday" in the Greco-Roman and other Indo-European calendars is also dedicated to the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lionel D. Barnett|title=Antiquities of India: An Account of the History and Culture of Ancient Hindustan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x40mwFwgK44C&amp;pg=PA190 |year=1994|publisher=[[Asian Educational Services]]|isbn=978-81-206-0530-5 |pages=188–192 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soma is part of the [[Navagraha]] in Hindu zodiac system. The role and importance of the Navagraha developed over time with various influences. Deifying the moon and its astrological significance occurred as early as the [[Vedic period]] and was recorded in the [[Vedas]]. The earliest work of astrology recorded in India is the [[Vedanga Jyotisha]] which began to be compiled in the 14th century BCE. The moon and various [[Classical planet|classical planets]] were referenced in the [[Atharvaveda]] around 1000 BCE.

The Navagraha was furthered by additional contributions from [[Western Asia]], including [[Zoroastrian calendar|Zoroastrian]] and [[Hellenistic astrology|Hellenistic]] influences. The [[Yavanajataka]], or 'Science of the [[Yavana|Yavanas]]', was written by the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greek]] named "[[Yavanesvara]]" ("Lord of the Greeks") under the rule of the [[Western Kshatrapa]] king [[Rudrakarman I]]. The Navagraha would further develop and culminate in the [[Shaka era]] with the [[Saka]], or Scythian, people. Additionally the contributions by the Saka people would be the basis of the [[Indian national calendar]], which is also called the Saka calendar.

The [[Hindu calendar]] is a [[Lunisolar calendar]] which records both lunar and solar cycles. Like the Navagraha, it was developed with the successive contributions of various works.

==Astronomy==

Soma was presumed to be a planet in Hindu astronomical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aryabhatta|author2=H. Kern (Editor, Commentary)|title=The Aryabhatiya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z8EUAAAAIAAJ |year=1973|publisher=Brill Archive |language=sa, en|page=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often discussed in various [[Sanskrit]] astronomical texts, such as the 5th century ''Aryabhatiya'' by [[Aryabhatta]], the 6th century ''Romaka'' by Latadeva and ''Panca Siddhantika'' by Varahamihira, the 7th century ''Khandakhadyaka'' by Brahmagupta and the 8th century ''Sisyadhivrddida'' by Lalla.&lt;ref name="Burgess1989vii"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ebenezer Burgess|editor=P Ganguly, P Sengupta|title=Sûrya-Siddhânta: A Text-book of Hindu Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0Uo_-_iizwC|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprint), Original: Yale University Press, American Oriental Society|isbn=978-81-208-0612-2|pages=vii–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other texts such as ''Surya Siddhanta'' dated to have been complete sometime between the 5th century and 10th century present their chapters on various planets with deity mythologies.&lt;ref name="Burgess1989vii"/&gt; However, they show that the Hindu scholars were aware of elliptical orbits, and the texts include sophisticated formulae to calculate its past and future positions:&lt;ref name=burgessxx&gt;{{cite book|author=Ebenezer Burgess|editor=P Ganguly, P Sengupta|title=Sûrya-Siddhânta: A Text-book of Hindu Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0Uo_-_iizwC|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprint), Original: Yale University Press, American Oriental Society|isbn=978-81-208-0612-2|pages=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ashvins''' ({{lang-sa|अश्विन्|Aśvin|horse possessors}}), also known as the '''Ashvini Kumaras''' and '''Asvinau''',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frame|2009}}, §1.42.&lt;/ref&gt; are [[Hindu deities|Hindu]] twin gods associated with medicine, health, dawn, and the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wise|first=Thomas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2u0lAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA4|title=Commentary on the Hindu System of Medicine|date=1860|publisher=Trübner|language=en|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Rigveda]]'', they are described as youthful divine twin horsemen, travelling in a chariot drawn by horses that are never weary, and portrayed as guardian deities that safeguard and rescue people by aiding them in various situations.{{sfn|Jamison|Brereton|2014|p=48}}{{Sfn|West|2007|p=187}}

There are varying accounts, but Ashvins are generally mentioned as the sons of the sun god [[Surya]] and his wife [[Sanjna]]. In the epic ''[[Mahabharata]],'' the Pandava twins [[Nakula]] and [[Sahadeva]] were the children of the Ashvins.

== Etymology and epithets ==
The [[Sanskrit]] name ''{{IAST|Aśvín}}'' (अश्विन्) derives from the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Indo-Iranian]] stem ''*Haćwa-'' (cf. [[Avestan]] ''aspā''), itself from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] word for the horse, ''*H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;éḱwos'', from which also descends the Lithuanian name ''[[Ašvieniai]]''.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;[[Alexander Lubotsky|Lubotsky, Alexander]]. "Indo-Aryan Inherited Lexicon". ''Indo-European Etymological Dictionary Project''. [[Leiden University]]. s.v. ''áśva-''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Rigveda]]'', the Ashvins are always referred to in the dual, without individual names,{{Sfn|West|2007|p=187}} although Vedic texts differentiate between the two Ashvins: "one of you is respected as the victorious lord of Sumakha, and the other as the fortunate son of heaven" (''RV'' 1.181.4). They are called several times ''divó nápātā,'' that is 'grandsons of [[Dyaus|Dyaús]] (the sky-god)'. This formula is comparable with the Lithuanian ''Dievo sūneliai'', 'sons of [[Dievas]] (the sky-god'), attached to the [[Ašvieniai]]; the Latvian ''[[Dieva Dēli]]'', the 'sons of Dievs (the sky-god)'; and the Greek ''Diós-kouroi'', the 'boys of [[Zeus]]', designating [[Castor and Pollux]].{{sfn|West|2007|p=187–191}}{{Sfn|Parpola|2015a|pp=109–110}}

The twin gods are also referred to as ''Nā́satyā'' (possibly 'saviours'; a derivative of ''nasatí'', 'safe return home'), a name that appears 99 times in the ''Rigveda''.{{Sfn|Parpola|2015a|pp=109–110}} The [[epithet]] probably derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*nes-'' ('to return home [safely]'), with [[cognate]]s in the [[Avestan]] ''Nā̊ŋhaiθya'', the name of a demon – as a result of a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] religious reformation that changed the status of prior deities –, and also in the Greek hero [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] and in the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] verb ''nasjan'' ('save, heal').{{Sfn|Frame|2009|p=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmadi|first=Amir|date=2015|title=Two Chthonic Features of the Daēva Cult in Historical Evidence|journal=History of Religions|volume=54|issue=3|pages=348|doi=10.1086/679000|issn=0018-2710|jstor=10.1086/679000|s2cid=162230518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the Ashvins are often called the ''Nasatyas'' or ''Dasras''. Sometimes one of them is referred to as ''Nasatya'' and one as ''Dasra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thadani|first=N.v.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MlKeGQiC58oC&amp;q=nasatya+and+dasra&amp;pg=PA362|title=The Mystery of the Mahabharata: Vol. I|publisher=India Research Press|pages=362|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and equivalents==
The Ashvins are an instance of the [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] [[Divine twins|divine horse twins]].{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=432}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Comparative Mythology|last=Puhvel|first=Jaan|date=1987|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=0-8018-3938-6|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=58–61|author-link=Jaan Puhvel}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|West|2007|p=187}} Reflexes in other Indo-European religions include the Lithuanian [[Ašvieniai]], the Latvian [[Dieva Dēli]], the Greek [[Castor and Pollux]]; and possibly the English [[Hengist and Horsa]], and the Welsh [[Bran the Blessed|Bran]] and [[Manawydan]].{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=432}}{{sfn|West|2007|p=187–191}} The first mention of the Nasatya twins is from a [[Mitanni-Aryan|Mitanni]] treaty (c.1350 BCE), between [[Suppiluliuma]] and [[Shattiwaza]], respectively kings of the Hittites and the [[Mitanni]].&lt;ref&gt;KBo 1 1. {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/hittitediplomati00beck_0 |title=Hittite Diplomatic Texts|author=Gary M.

===Vedic texts===
The Ashvins are mentioned 398 times in the ''Rigveda'',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with more than 50 hymns specifically dedicated to them: 1.3, 1.22, 1.34, 1.46–47, 1.112, 1.116–120, 1.157–158, 1.180–184, 2.20, 3.58, 4.43–45, 5.73–78, 6.62–63, 7.67–74, 8.5, 8.8–10, 8.22, 8.26, 8.35, 8.57, 8.73, 8.85–87, 10.24, 10.39–41, 10.143.{{Sfn|West|2007|p=187}}

{{Poemquote|text=Your chariot, o Aśvins, swifter than mind, drawn by good horses, comes to the clans.
By which (chariot) you go to the home of the good ritual performer, by that, o men, travel your course to us.
You free Atri, the seer of the five peoples, from narrow straits, from the earth cleft along with his band, o men—confounding the wiles of the merciless Dasyu, driving them out, one after another, o bulls.

O Aśvins—you men, you bulls—by the wondrous powers you draw back together the seer Rebha, who bobbed away in the waters, like a horse hidden by those of evil ways.

According to the text, the Ashvins were born after the sun god [[Vivasvat]] and his wife [[Saranyu]] (Sanjna) engaged in love making in the form of a stallion and a mare respectively.{{sfn|Lang|1887}} The Ashvins are also called "''divó nápātā"'', which is variously translated as either "sons" or "grandsons" of Dyaush.{{sfn|West|2007|p=187–191}}{{Sfn|Parpola|2015a|pp=109–110}}&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Macdonell|first=Arthur Anthony|title=Vedic Mythology|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1897|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=De Witt Griswold|first1=Harvey|title=The Religion of the Rigveda|last2=Farquhar|first2=J. N.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1923|pages=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one mention, the [[Indus River|Indus (Sindhu) River]] is stated to be their mother.{{sfn|Jamison|Brereton|2014|p=157}} Ashvins were the close companions of the Vedic mother goddess [[Ushas]] (dawn) and sometimes they are even mentioned as her sons.{{sfn|Kinsley|1988|p=6}} The marriage of the Ashvin brothers is narrated in the ''Sukta'' 117 of Rigveda. According to the legend, the sun god, Surya-[[Savitra]], had a daughter named Sūryā (with a long ā) and arranged a horse-race to choose her bridegroom. The Ashvins won the race and thus, both of them married Suryā.{{sfn|Mani|1975|p=71}}{{sfn|Jamison|Brereton|2014|p=48}}{{efn|Contradictory to this, some chapters of Rigveda suggest that Sūryā's bridegroom was the god Soma and the Ashvins were his friends.{{sfn|Kramisch|Miller|1983|p=171}}}} [[Pushan]] is also stated to have chosen the Ashvins to be his fathers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Sfn|Jamison|Brereton|2014|p=1522}}

The Ashvins are depicted as the helpers of mortals in various ''suktas'' of Rigveda. The ''sukta'' 112 describes that when the sage Dirghashravas prayed to Ashvins for rain, the twins poured sweet water from the sky. According to ''sukta'' 16, they also helped the sage Gotama, who was lost in a desert and begged for water. It is described that the gods dug a water well and helped the sage.{{sfn|Mani|1975|p=71}} According to another account, Rebha was bound, stabbed, and cast into the waters for nine days and ten nights before being saved by the twins. He was explicitly described as "dead" when the twins "raised (him) up" to save him (''RV'' 10.39.9). Similarly, Bhujyu was saved after his father or evil companions abandoned him at sea when the twins brought him home from the dead ancestors (''RV,'' 1.119.4).{{Sfn|Frame|2009|p=}} 
 
The Ashvins also raised Vandana, rescued Atri from a fissure in the earth and its heat, found Vishnapu and returned him to his father, restored the youth of Kali, brought Kamadyū as a wife for Vimada, gave a son to Vadhrimatī (whose husband was a steer), restored the eyesight of Rijrashva, replaced the foot of [[Vishpala]] with a metal one, made the cow Śayu give milk, gave a horse to Pedu, and put a horse's head on [[Dadhichi|Dadhyañc]].{{sfn|Jamison|Brereton|2014|p=48}} 
According to the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'', Ashvins once tried to seduce [[Sukanya]], the daughter of king Saryati and wife of an old sage named [[Chyavana]]. However, she refused and claimed that the twins were imperfect and told them to restore the youth of Chyavana. Desperate to know the reason for her words, they fulfilled her condition and the sage finally revealed that Ashvins were excluded from a [[yajna]] (fire sacrifice) performed by the gods, and thus, they were incomplete. Ashvins went to the sacrifice but the gods don't accept, claiming that the Ashvins were spending too much time with the mortals. After many attempts of explanation, they were finally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FeAyMeaRwtMC&amp;q=chyavana+sukanya&amp;pg=PA342|title = "The" Vishnu Purana ; 3: A System of Hindu Mythology and Tradition ; Translated from the Original Sanskrit, and Illustrated by Notes Derived Chiefly from Other Puranas|year = 1866|last1 = Wilson|first1 = Horace H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ashvins are sometimes presented as fierce deities. In the ''sukta'' 117, they even destroyed an ''[[asura]]'' Vishvaka as well as his dynasty.{{sfn|Mani|1975|p=71}}

=== Post-Vedic text ===
[[File:Sukanya praying to Aswini kumaras to reveal her husband's identity.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sukanya praying to the Ashvini Kumaras to reveal her husband's identity]]
In the post-Vedic texts of Hinduism, the Ashvins remain significant, and in these texts, one of them is referred as Nasatya and the another one is known as Darsa. Many of their legends are rewritten in various texts like the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', ''[[Harivansha|Harivamsha]],'' and the ''[[Puranas]]''.

According to these texts, Sanjna, daughter of [[Vishvakarma]], was married to Surya, but she was unable to bear his heat and decided to abandon him. She ran away and roamed in the forest of northern [[Kuru kingdom]] in  the form of a mare. The ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' adds that she performed austerities in the forest to gain control over Surya's heat. After Surya discovered Sanjna's disappearance, he located her and made love with her in a form of stallion. Sanjna gave birth to the twins.{{sfn|Mani|1975|p=69}} Rarely, in some ''Purana''s, Ashvins are mentioned as the sons (creation) of the god [[Brahma]].{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=64}}

These texts also elaborate the story of [[Chyavana]], which was first narrated in [[Brahmanas]].{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=100}} In this version, [[Sukanya]]{{mdash}}the beautiful daughter of the king Saryati{{mdash}} 
accidentally blinded the old Chyavana, who was performing austerities. She married him to save her kingdom from his wrath and served him dutifully.{{sfn|Mani|1975|p=69}} While traveling on their chariot, the Ashvins saw Sukanya in a forest and tried to seduce her. They asked her to choose one of them as her new husband, but she refused and remained faithful to Chyavana. The twins were impressed by her chastity and asked her to wish anything. Upon their request, she told them to restore the youth and sight of Chyavana. Ashvins agreed but they had a condition. After curing Chyavana, they would also take similar form and she would have to identify Chyavana. Sukanya showed her consent after getting permission from her husband. Ashvins took Chyavana into a lake and cured him. When a young Chyavana emerged from the lake, Ashvins also took forms similar to him and Sukanya successfully identified her husband.{{sfn|Mani|1975|p=70}}{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=101}}

The ''Mahabharata'' also narrates about the birth of Nakula and Sahadeva, who were the “spiritual sons” of the Ashvins. According to the epic, a king named [[Pandu]] was unable to make love due to a curse and didn't have any heir. However, he advised his wives, [[Kunti]] and [[Madri]], to invoke various gods and ask for sons. Ashvins Nasatya and Darsa blessed Madri with Nakula and Sahadeva respectively.{{sfn|Mani|1975|p=71}}&lt;ref&gt;Hindu World: An Encyclopedic Survey of Hinduism. Volume II M-Z. Benjamin Walker. Routledge. 2019. Entry: "Pandava"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associations ==
[[File:Thewakamnoet (1959, p. 147).jpg|thumb|Thai depiction of the Horse-faced Ashvins on a chariot]]
The Ashvins are often associated with rescuing mortals and bringing them back to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frame|2009}}, §1.43.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|See [[#Vedic texts]] section of Literature and legends}} The ''[[Rigveda]]'' also describes the Ashvins as "bringing light": they gave "light-bringing help" (''svàrvatīr''…''ūtī́r'', 1.119.8) to Bhujyu, and "raised (Rebha) up to see the sun" (''úd''…''aírayataṃ svàr dṛśé'', 1.112.5).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frame|2009}}, §1.44.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|West|2007|p=187}}

The Ashvins are associated with honey, which was likely offered to them in a sacrifice. They are the chief deities in the [[Pravargya|Pravargya rite]], in which they are offered hot milk. They are also associated with the morning pressing of [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], because they are dual deities, along with [[Indra]]-[[Vayu|Vāyu]] and [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]]-[[Varuna|Varuṇa]]. They also are the last deities to receive Soma in the Atirātra, or Overnight Soma Ritual.{{sfn|Jamison|Brereton|2014|p=47}}

The Ashvins are invoked at dawn, the time of their principal sacrifice, and have a close connection with the dawn goddess, [[Ushas|Uṣas]]: she is bidden to awaken them (8.9.17), they follow her in their chariot (8.5.2), she is born when they hitch their steeds (10.39.12), and their chariot is once said to arrive before her (1.34.10). They are consequently associated with the "return from darkness": the twins are called “darkness slayers” (''tamohánā'', 3.39.3), they are invoked with the formula "you who have made light for mankind" (''yā́v''…''jyótir jánāya cakráthuḥ'', 1.92.17), and their horses and chariot are described as "uncovering the covered darkness" (''aporṇuvántas táma ā́ párīvṛtam'', 4.45.2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frame|2009}}, §1.45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chariot of the Ashvins is repeatedly mentioned in the ''Rigveda''. Their chariot has three chariot-boxes, three wheels, three turnings, and three wheel rims. The emphasis on the number 3 is symbolized in the sacrifice with its three soma pressings. The chariot is pulled by bulls, buffaloes, horses, birds, geese, and falcons. The chariot allows the Ashvins to be quick and mobile and travel to a number of places, which is necessary to fulfill their role of rescuing people. Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun, is sometimes mentioned as the wife of the Ashvins, and she rides with them in their chariot.{{sfn|Jamison|Brereton|2014|p=48}}

It is also believed that the Ashvins were the first one to prepare the [[Chyawanprash]] formulation for Rishi [[Chyavana]] at his [[Ashram]] on [[Dhosi Hill]] near [[Narnaul]], [[Haryana]], [[India]], hence the name ''Chyawanprash''.&lt;ref&gt;Panda, H; ''Handbook on Ayurvedic Medicines With Formulae, Processes And Their Uses'', 2004, p10 {{ISBN|978-81-86623-63-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dattatreya''' ({{lang-sa|दत्तात्रेय}}, {{IAST3|Dattātreya}}&lt;!--Do not remove, WP:INDICSCRIPT doesn't apply to WikiProject Hinduism--&gt;), '''Dattā''' or '''Dattaguru''', is a [[paradigmatic]] [[Sannyasi]] (monk) and one of the lords of [[yoga]], venerated as a [[Hindu god]].&lt;ref name="lochtefelddatta"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

According to Rigopoulos, in the [[Nath]] tradition of [[Shaivism]], Dattatreya is revered as the Adi-Guru (First Teacher) of the [[Adinath Sampradaya]] of the Nathas, the first "Lord of Yoga" with mastery of [[Tantra]] (techniques), although most traditions and scholars consider Adi Nath to be an epithet of Lord [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;Rigopoulos (1998), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harper &amp; Brown (2002), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mallinson, Dattatreya is not the traditional guru of the Nath Sampradaya but instead was co-opted by the Nath tradition in about the 18th century as a guru, as a part of Vishnu-Shiva syncretism. This is evidenced by the Marathi text ''Navanathabhaktisara'', states Mallinson, wherein there is syncretic fusion of the Nath Sampradaya with the Mahanubhava sect by identifying nine Naths with nine Narayanas.{{sfn|Mallinson|2012|pp=407–411}}

Dattatreya iconography varies regionally. In [[Maharashtra]], for example, he is typically shown with three heads and six hands, one head each for [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]] who represent the [[Trimurti]], the 3 main gods in Hinduism, and one pair of hands holding the symbolic items associated with each of these gods: [[japamala]] and [[kamandalu|water pot]] of Brahma, [[shakha|conch]] and [[Sudarshana Chakra|discus]] of Vishnu, [[Trishula|trident]] and [[damaru|drum]] of Shiva.&lt;ref name="Berntsen1988p95" /&gt; He is typically dressed as a simple monk, situated in a forest or wilderness suggestive of his renunciation of worldly goods and pursuit of a meditative yogic lifestyle. In paintings and some large carvings, he is surrounded by four dogs and a cow, which symbolise the four [[Vedas]] and mother earth who nourishes all living beings.&lt;ref name="Berntsen1988p95" /&gt;&lt;ref name=hopewerness138 /&gt; In the temples of southern Maharashtra, Varanasi, and in the Himalayas, he is shown with one head and two hands accompanied by four dogs and a cow.{{Sfn| Rigopoulos|1998|pp=224–226}}

An annual festival in the Hindu calendar month of Mārgaśīrṣa (November/December) reveres Dattatreya and is known as [[Datta Jayanti]].&lt;ref&gt;Gudrun Buhnemann (1988), Puja: A study in Smarta Ritual, University of Vienna, Be Nobili, Editor: G Oberhammer, page 126&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
In the [[Purana]]s, he was born in an Indian hermitage to [[Anasuya]] and her husband, the Vedic sage, [[Atri]] who is traditionally credited with making the largest contribution to the [[Rigveda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= [https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada/page/73 73]|editor=K.S.

While his origins are unclear, stories about his life are clearer. He is described in the [[Mahabharata]] as an exceptional [[Rishi]] (sage) with extraordinary insights and knowledge, who is adored and raised to a [[Guru]] and an [[Avatar]] of Vishnu in the Puranas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Rigopoulos|title=Dattatreya: The Immortal Guru, Yogin, and Avatara|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZM-BlvaqAf0C|year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3696-7|pages=27–28|access-date=10 October 2016|archive-date=8 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108131550/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZM-BlvaqAf0C|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dattatreya is stated in these texts to having renounced the world and leaving his home at an early age to lead a monastic life. One myth claims he meditated immersed in water for a long time,&lt;ref name=rigopoulos6 /&gt; another has him wandering from childhood and the young Dattatreya footprints have been preserved on a lonely peak at [[Girnar]] (Junagadh, Gujarat).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-jain-trust-files-plea-in-hc-over-girnar-shrine-row-1787615 |title=Jain trust files plea in HC over Girnar shrine row |access-date=16 September 2019 |archive-date=20 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020115516/https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-jain-trust-files-plea-in-hc-over-girnar-shrine-row-1787615 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dattatray make a tapa for 12000 years over there.

=== Self-education: The 24 Gurus of Dattatreya ===
The young Dattatreya is famous in the Hindu texts as the one who started with nothing and without teachers, yet reached self-awareness by observing nature during his ''Sannyasi'' wanderings, and treating these natural observations as his twenty four teachers.&lt;ref name=rigopoulos40&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Rigopoulos|title=Dattatreya: The Immortal Guru, Yogin, and Avatara: A Study of the Transformative and Inclusive Character of a Multi-faceted Hindu Deity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ce0WuAF247wC|year=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-1733-2|pages=40–57|access-date=10 October 2016|archive-date=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329142457/https://books.google.com/books?id=ce0WuAF247wC|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legend has been emblematic in the Hindu belief, particularly among artists and [[Yogi]]s, that ideas, teachings and practices come from all sources, that self effort is a means to learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Rigopoulos|title=Dattatreya: The Immortal Guru, Yogin, and Avatara: A Study of the Transformative and Inclusive Character of a Multi-faceted Hindu Deity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ce0WuAF247wC|year=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-1733-2|pages=57–58|access-date=10 October 2016|archive-date=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329142457/https://books.google.com/books?id=ce0WuAF247wC|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=klausk478 /&gt; The 24 teachers of Dattatreya are:&lt;ref name=rigopoulos40 /&gt;&lt;ref name=martinhaig131&gt;Martin Haig (2007), [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ842786.pdf Sri Dattatreya’s 24 Gurus: Learning from the World in Hindu Tradition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006061423/http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ842786.pdf |date=6 October 2016 }}, Canadian Journal of Environmental Education, Vol. 12, pages 131–135&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of Shri Dattatreya in pictures varies according to traditional beliefs. A typical icon for Dattatreya, particularly popular with [[Marathi people|Marathi-speaking people]] in India, has three heads corresponding to Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva, and six hands; the lowest two hands carry [[japamala]] and water pot (kamandalu), middle pair of hands hold hourglass mini-drum (damaru) and trident (trishul), and top two hands have conch (shankh) and spinning wheel (chakra).&lt;ref name="Berntsen1988p95" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;मालाकमंडलुरधः करपद्मयुग्मे, मध्यस्थ पाणियुगुले डमरूत्रिशूले | यस्यस्त उर्ध्वकरयोः शुभशंखचक्रे वंदे तमत्रिवरदं भुजषटकयुक्तम&lt;/ref&gt;

Many older medieval temples of Dattatreya show him with just one head, such as the one in [[Mahur, Maharashtra|Mahur]], one at [[Narayanpur, Pune|Narayanpur on Pune Satara Road]], Near Pune, and another in [[Pandharpur]], both in southern [[Maharashtra]].{{Sfn| Rigopoulos|1998|pp=223–224}} Texts such as [[Agni Purana]] describe the architectural features for building [[murti]], and for Dattatreya, it recommends him with one head and two hands.{{Sfn| Rigopoulos|1998|p=224}} In [[Varanasi]], [[Nepal]], north Himalayan foothill states of India, 15th-century Nath temples of Dattatreya show him with just one face. In western parts of Maharashtra, the syncretic six armed and three faced iconography is more common.{{Sfn| Rigopoulos|1998|pp=224–226}}

He is the motif of the '"honey bee" Yogin who has realized advaita knowledge. Dattatreya as the archetypal model of [[syncretism]]:&lt;ref name="Berntsen1988p95" /&gt;

{{Blockquote|
Furthermore, the unfolding of the Dattātreya icon illustrates the development of Yoga as a synthetic and inclusive body of ideologies and practices. Although fundamentally a ''jñāna-mūrti'', Dattātreya is a "honey bee" Yogin: one whose character and teachings are developed by gathering varieties of Yoga's flowers. For all religious groups whose propensity it is to include ideas, practices, and teaching from the ocean of traditions, Dattātreya is truly a paradigm.

Another distinctive aspect of Dattatreya iconography is that it includes four dogs and a cow. The four dogs represent the Vedas,&lt;ref name="hopewerness138"&gt;Werness, Hope B. (2004).''

=== Alternate iconography ===
Dattatreya's sculptures with alternate iconography have been identified in 1st millennium CE cave temples and archaeological sites related to Hinduism.{{Sfn| Rigopoulos|1998|pp=227-228}} For example, in the [[Badami]] temple (Karnataka), Dattatreya is shown to be with single head and four hands like Vishnu, but seated in a serene Yoga posture (''padmasana''). Carved with him are the emblems (''lañchana'') of the Trimurti, namely the swan of Brahma, the Garuda of Vishnu and the Nandi of Shiva. The right earlobe jewelry and hair decoration in this art work of Dattatreya is of Shiva, but on his left the details are those of Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T. A. Gopinatha Rao|title=Elements of Hindu iconography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJD-KresBwIC|year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0878-2|pages=252–255|access-date=10 October 2016|archive-date=26 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426090024/https://books.google.com/books?id=MJD-KresBwIC|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rigopoulos dates this Badami sculpture to be from the 10th to 12th century.{{Sfn| Rigopoulos|1998|pp=227-228}}

A sculpture similar to Badami, but with some differences, has been discovered in [[Ajmer]] (Rajasthan). The Ajmer art work is a free statue where Dattatreya is standing, has one head and four hands. In his various hands, he carries a ''Trishula'' of Shiva, a ''Chakra'' of Vishnu, a ''Kamandalu'' of Brahma, and a rosary common to all three.&lt;ref name=rao255&gt;{{cite book|author=T. A. Gopinatha Rao|title=Elements of Hindu iconography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJD-KresBwIC|year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0878-2|pages=251 (figure 2), 255|access-date=10 October 2016|archive-date=26 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426090024/https://books.google.com/books?id=MJD-KresBwIC|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Badami relief work, the Ajmer iconography of Dattatreya shows the swan of Brahma, the Garuda of Vishnu and the Nandi of Shiva carved on the pedestal with him.&lt;ref name=rao255 /&gt;

Some scholars such as James Harle and TA Gopinatha Rao consider iconography that presents Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva together as ''Hari Hara Pitamaha'' to be synonymous with or equivalent to Dattatreya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James C. Harle|title=The Art and Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent|url=https://archive.org/details/artarchitectureo00harl|url-access=registration|year=1994|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-06217-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/artarchitectureo00harl/page/236 236]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T.

The historic Indian literature has interpreted the representation of Dattatreya symbolically. His three heads are symbols of the [[Gunas]] (qualities in [[Samkhya]] school of Hinduism). The three Gunas are Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. The six hands have ethical symbolism, namely [[Yamas]], [[Niyama]], Sama, Dama, Daya and Shanti (axiology in [[Yoga]] and [[Vedanta]] school of Hinduism).&lt;ref name=rigo243 /&gt;

The ''Kamadhenu'' cow is symbolic ''Panchabutas'', the four dogs are inner forces of a human being: Iccha, Vasana, Asha and Trishna. In these interpretations, Dattatreya is that yogi [[Guru]] (teacher) who has perfected all these, rules them rather than is ruled by them, and is thus the Guru Dattatreya is beyond them.&lt;ref name=rigo243&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Rigopoulos|title=Dattatreya: The Immortal Guru, Yogin, and Avatara: A Study of the Transformative and Inclusive Character of a Multi-faceted Hindu tradition Deity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ce0WuAF247wC|year=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-1733-2|pages=243 footnote 40|access-date=10 October 2016|archive-date=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329142457/https://books.google.com/books?id=ce0WuAF247wC|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Texts ==

The ''[[Dattatreya Upanishad]]'' (tantra-focussed), ''[[Darshana Upanishad]]'' (yoga-focussed) and particularly the ''[[Avadhutaka Upanishad|Avadhuta Upanishad]]'' (advaita-focussed) present the philosophy of the Dattatreya tradition.{{Sfn| Rigopoulos|1998|pp=64–71, 223}}{{sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=273–277}} Dattatreya is also mentioned in the classic text on [[Yoga]], the [[Shandilya Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larson|first1=Gerald James|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=Ram Shankar|title=Yoga : India's Philosophy of Meditation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p6pURGdBBmIC|year=2008|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3349-4|page=608=harv|access-date=10 October 2016|archive-date=8 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108132443/https://books.google.com/books?id=p6pURGdBBmIC|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Upanishads where Dattatreya's name appears in lists of ancient Hindu monks revered for their insights on [[sannyasa|renunciation]] are ''[[Jabala Upanishad]]'', ''[[Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad]]'', ''[[Bhikshuka Upanishad]]'' and ''[[Yajnavalkya Upanishad]]''.{{Sfn| Rigopoulos|1998|p=57}}{{sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=145, 184, 237, 278–280 (see first three sections)}} Of these, his mention in the ''Jabala Upanishad'' is chronologically significant because this ancient text is dated to have been complete between the 3rd century BCE and 3rd century CE.{{sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=5–11}}

''[[Tripura Rahasya]]'' is also an important ancient text attributed to Dattatreya.

Dattatreya is mentioned in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''&lt;ref&gt;Vanaparva 115.12, Shantiparva 49.36–37, Anushasanparva 152.5 and 153.12&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Ramayana]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Dattatreya is mentioned in the ancient chapter 9 of the ''[[Sattvata Samhita]]'' and chapter 5 of the ''[[Ahirbudhnya Samhita]]'', both among the oldest layer of texts in the Vaishnava [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agama]] tradition (Pancaratra).{{Sfn| Rigopoulos|1998|p=43}} Schrader states these texts and the chronology of Dattatreya are older than the Mahabharata, but Rigopoulos disagrees with him on the chronology.{{Sfn| Rigopoulos|1998|p=43}}

In the Hindu tradition, Dattatreya is the author of ''[[Avadhuta Gita]]'', or the "Song of the free".{{Sfn|Rigopoulos|1998|p=195}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=John A.

[[File:Lord Dattatreya from Devgad.jpg|150px|thumb|Lord Dattatreya Idol in Maharashtra]]
Several Hindu monastic and yoga traditions are linked to Dattatreya:&lt;ref name="Joshi 2000"&gt;Joshi, Dr. P. N. (2000) ''Shri Dattatreya Dnyankosh''. Pune: Shri Dattatreya Dnyankosh Prakashan.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Nath sampradaya: The [[Nath]] yogis, that metamorphosed into a warrior ascetic group, consider Dattatreya as their theological founder.{{Sfn|Rigopoulos|1998|pp=99–104, 218}} This group grew and became particularly prominent during the Islamic invasions and Hindu-Muslim wars in South Asia, from about the 14th to 18th century, although the Dattatreya roots of the peaceful Nath yogis go back to about the 10th century. The group was most active in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Nepal. The tradition believes that the legendary Nath sampradaya yogi and Hatha Yoga innovator [[Gorakshanath]] was inspired and shaped by Dattatreya.{{Sfn|Rigopoulos|1998|pp=99–104, 218}} Regional efforts and texts of the Nath tradition such as ''Yogi sampradaya vishkriti'' discussed Dattatreya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karine Schomer|author2=W.

* Avadhuta sampradaya: The nine ''Narayanas'' of the Avadhuta sampradaya are attributed to Dattatreya, an idea also found in the Natha sampradaya.{{Sfn|Rigopoulos|1998|p=99}} A panth started by [[Panth Maharaj|Pantmaharaj Balekundrikar]] of [[Balekundri (B.K.)|Balekundri]] near [[Belgavi]] is related to this.

*Dasanami sampradaya and [[Shakti]] pithas: Dattatreya is revered in Dasanami and goddess-oriented Shaktism traditions.{{Sfn|Rigopoulos|1998|pp=xiii, 89, 94–95}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raeside|first=I.

* Mahanubhava tradition: Along with [[Krishna]], the [[Mahanubhava]] tradition considers Dattatreya as their divine inspiration. The Mahanubhava Panth, propagated by Sri [[Chakradhar Swami]], has five Krishnas, of which Dattatreya is one as their Adi Guru (the original Guru), as well as the early teachers in their tradition (Chakradhar, Gundam, Changdev).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Rigopoulos|title=The Mahanubhavs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zHNQf5G5tRgC&amp;pg=PA9|year=2005|publisher=Firenze University Press|isbn=978-88-8453-264-0|pages=9–10|access-date=10 October 2016|archive-date=27 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227231344/https://books.google.com/books?id=zHNQf5G5tRgC&amp;pg=PA9|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worship Dattatreya as single headed with two arms. He has a temple dedicated in Mahur by this tradition.{{Sfn| Rigopoulos|1998|pp=223-224}}
*Gurucharitra tradition: This tradition is named after the Marathi text ''Gurucharitra'' consisting of 51 chapters, containing the life stories of 14th-century Datta Avatar [[Sripada Srivallabha]] and 15th-century Datta Avatar [[Narasimha Saraswati]].&lt;ref name="Rigopoulos1993p269" /&gt; The text was composed by Sarasvati Gangadhara, consists of three sections called Jnanakanda (chapters 1–24), Karmakanda (25–37) and Bhaktikanda (38–51), and is considered a sacred mantra-filled text in the Gurucharita tradition in parts of Maharashtra, north Karnataka and Gujarat.

*Manik Prabhu (Sakalamata) Sampradaya: In this tradition, Dattatreya is worshipped with his Shakti, known as Madhumati. This tradition was started by the 19th century saint Shri [[Manik Prabhu]], who is considered an Avatar of Dattatreya. [[Manik Nagar]] is the spiritual headquarters of this Sampradaya. Shri Manik Prabhu also established a Guru Parampara at Maniknagar for the spiritual guidance of devotees. Shri Manik Prabhu and his successors have written many abhangas and bhajans in Marathi &amp; Kannada in praise of lord Dattatreya which are regularly sung at [[Manik Nagar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sakalmat Sampradaya &gt; Shri Manik Prabhu Samsthan|url=https://www.manikprabhu.org/sakalmat-sampradaya/|access-date=2021-03-14|website=Shri Manik Prabhu Samsthan|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lal Padris: another Hindu yogi group from western India with roots in the 10th-century and with ideas similar to Nath and Kanphata sampradaya, traces Dattatreya as the basis of their spiritual ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Weston Briggs|title=Gorakhnāth and the Kānphaṭa Yogīs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DXPa3jZDQZUC|year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0564-4|pages=74–75|access-date=10 October 2016|archive-date=7 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507204037/https://books.google.com/books?id=DXPa3jZDQZUC|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Around 1550 CE, Dattatreya Yogi taught the Dattatreya philosophy to his disciple Das Gosavi in [[Marathi language|Marathi]]. Das Gosavi then taught this philosophy to his two [[Telugu people|Telugu]] disciples Gopalbhatt and Sarvaved who studied and translated Das Gosavi's book of ''Vedantavyavaharsangraha'' into Telugu language. According to Prof. R. C. Dhere, Dattatreya Yogi and Das Gosavi are the original gurus in the Telugu Dattatreya tradition. Prof. Venkata Rao states that ''Dattatreya Shatakamu'' was written by Paramanandateertha who is equally important in his contributions to the Telugu tradition of Dattatreya. He was a proponent of [[Advaita]] philosophy and dedicated his two epics, ''Anubhavadarpanamu'' and ''Shivadnyanamanjari'' to Shri Dattatreya. His famous ''Vivekachintamani'' book was translated into [[Kannada]] by Nijashivagunayogi and Lingayat saint Shanatalingaswami translated this into Marathi.&lt;ref&gt;''Works relating to the Dattatreya Cult in Telugu Literature'': N. Venkata Rao (''Essays in Philosophy'' presented to Dr. T. M. P. Mahadevan, Madras, 1962. pp464-475).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vishvakarma''' or '''Vishvakarman''' ({{lang-sa|विश्वकर्मा|Viśvakarmā|all maker}}) is a craftsman deity and the divine architect of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] in contemporary [[Hinduism]]. In the early texts, the craftsman deity was known as [[Tvastar]] and the word "Vishvakarma" was originally used as an epithet for any powerful deity. However, in many later traditions, Vishvakarma became the name of the craftsman god.&lt;ref name = Anc&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Coulter|first1=Charles Russell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWxekbhM1yEC&amp;q=visvakarma&amp;pg=PT1134|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities|last2=Turner|first2=Patricia|date=2013-07-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-96397-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vishvakarma crafted all of the chariots of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] and weapons including the ''[[Vajra]]'' of the god [[Indra]].&lt;ref&gt;Coomaraswamy (1979), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Vishvakarma was related to the sun god [[Surya]] through his daughter [[Saranyu|Samjna]]. According to the legend, when Samjna left her house due to Surya's energy, Vishvakarma reduced the energy and created various other weapons using it. Vishvakarma also built various cities like [[Lanka]], [[Dvārakā|Dvaraka]], and [[Indraprastha]].&lt;ref name="Anc" /&gt; According to the epic ''[[Ramayana]]'', the ''[[vanara]]'' (forest-man or monkey) [[Nala (Ramayana)|Nala]] was the son of Vishvakarma, created to aid the avatar [[Rama]].

{{Hinduism}}

The term Visvakarman was originally used as an epithet for any supreme god&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vishvakarman {{!}} Hindu mythology|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Vishvakarman|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as an attribute of [[Indra]] and the [[Surya|Sun]]. The name Visvakarman occurs five times in the tenth book of the Rigveda. The two hymns of the Rigveda identify Visvakarman as all-seeing, and having eyes, faces, arms and feet on every side and also has wings. [[Brahma]], the  god of creation, who is four-faced and four-armed resembles him in these aspects. He is represented as being the source of all prosperity, swift in his thoughts and titled a seer, priest, and lord of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macdonell|first=Arthur Anthony|title=Vedic Mythology|date=1898|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-8-12081-113-3|url={{googlebooks|b7Meabtj8mcC|page=41|plainurl=y}}|page=41|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cambogia, vishvakarman, l'architetto divino, periodo angkor, xiii secolo ca.jpg|thumb|Cambodian idol of Vishvakarma]]
According to some parts of the ''[[Rigveda]]'', Vishvakarma was the personification of ultimate reality, the abstract creative power inherent in deities, living and non-living being in this universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vishvakarman – Oxford Reference|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803120038316|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered to be the fifth monotheistic God concept: He is both The Architect and The Divine Engineer of The Universe from before the advent of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sprochi|first=Amanda K.|editor-last=Melton|editor-first=J. Gordon|title=Religious Celebrations: L-Z|date=2011|location=Santa Barbara, CA|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-205-0|url={{googlebooks|KDU30Ae4S4cC|page=908|plainurl=y}}|page=908|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The later parts of the Rigveda reveals efforts to find a satisfactory answer to the mysteries regarding the origin of the universe, the creation hymns present in these parts of the Rigveda mention individual creator gods as opposed to the collection of gods and their chiefs ([[Indra]], [[Varuna]], [[Agni]], etc.) creating the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dhavamony|first=Mariasusai|title=Classical Hinduism|date=1982|publisher=Gregorian Biblical BookShop|isbn=978-8-87652-482-0|url={{googlebooks|DD0w_IMFA8gC|page=48|plainurl=y}}|page=48|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[historical Vedic religion]], the role of Vishvakarma as the builder of gods is attributed to [[Tvastar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWxekbhM1yEC&amp;q=visvakarma&amp;pg=PT1134|title = Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities|isbn = 9781135963972|last1 = Coulter|first1 = Charles Russell|last2 = Turner|first2 = Patricia|date = 4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vedic Vishvakarman is identified with [[Prajapati]] rather than [[Tvastar|''Tvaṣṭṛ'']].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Monier-Williams|first=Monier|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1899|pages=994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macdonell|first=Arthur Anthony|title=Vedic Mythology|year=1897|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later mythology, Vishvakarman is sometimes identified with ''Tvaṣṭṛ'' and is a craftsman deity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Monier-Williams]] (1899) p. 994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
{{multiple image

}}
Vishvakarma's iconography varies drastically from one region to another, though all picture him with creation tools. In the most popular depiction, he is depicted as an aged and wise man, with [[Chaturbhuja|four arms]]. He has white beard and is accompanied by his vahana, ''[[hamsa (bird)|hamsa]]'' (goose or swan), which scholars believe that these suggest his association with the creator god [[Brahma]]. Usually, he is seated on a throne and his sons standing near him. This form of Vishvakarma is mainly found in the Western and North Western parts of India.&lt;ref name="Vishva1"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Jacobsen|first1=Knut A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPmADwAAQBAJ&amp;q=vishwakarman&amp;pg=PT36|title=Religion and Technology in India: Spaces, Practices and Authorities|last2=Myrvold|first2=Kristina|date=2019-01-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-351-20477-4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contradictory to the above account, the idols of Vishvakarma in the eastern parts of India depict him as a young muscular man. He has black moustache and is not accompanied by his sons. An elephant is his vahana, suggesting his association with [[Indra]] or [[Brihaspati]].&lt;ref name="Vishva1" /&gt;

== Family ==
Parentage of Vishvakarma differs in many other texts. In the [[Nirukta]] and [[Brahmana]]s he is stated to be the son of Bhuvana. In the [[Mahabharata]] and [[Harivamsa|Harivansha]], he is the son of Vasu Prabhāsa and Yoga-siddhā. In the [[Puranas]], he is the son of Vāstu or sometimes, [[Brahma]]. Vishvakarma is the  father of three daughters named Barhishmati, [[Sanjna|Samjna]] and Chitrangada, as well as five sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9v1OAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=vishwakarma+Chitrangada|title=The Sacred Scriptures of India|date=2009|publisher=Anmol Publications|isbn=978-81-261-3630-8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Vamana Purana]], Vishvakarma is presented as the husband of the celestial nymph [[Ghritachi]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When identified with Tvastar, Vishvakarma is also described to be the father of a son named [[Trisiras|Vishvarupa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Debroy|first1=Bibek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jXoRAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=vishvakarma+vishvarupa|title=The Holy Puranas|last2=Debroy|first2=Dipavali|date=2002|publisher=B.R. Publishing Corporation|isbn=978-81-7646-299-0|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vishvakarma Puja==

Among those who celebrate Vishwakarma's birthday, it is celebrated on two days under different names:
* ''Vishvakarma Puja''. "Vishvakarma Puja" always celebrated in India on the 17/18 September of every Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.calendarlabs.com/holidays/hindu/vishwakarma-puja.php|title=Vishwakarma Puja in Hindu Calendar}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Rishi Panchami Dinam''. "Rishi Panchami Dinam" literally means ‘the day of the solidarity of five rishis.’ Those who celebrate this day believe that Vishvakarma did not have a birthday like the mortals but only a commemoration day in which his five children (supposedly five ''rishis'') came together to declare their solidarity and pray to their illustrious father. This day follows the rules of the [[Hindu calendar]] and changes with every year. The five groups among the [[Vishwakarma (caste)|Vishvakarma community]] also celebrate this as an auspicious day in commemoration of their patron god at present.&lt;ref&gt;Achary, Subramanian Matathinkal (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parashurama''' ({{Lang-sa|परशुराम|lit= Rama with an axe|Paraśurāma}})&lt;!--Do not remove, WP:INDICSCRIPT doesn't apply to WikiProject Hinduism--&gt;, also referred to as '''Rama Jamadagnya''', '''Rama Bhargava''' and '''Veerarama''',&lt;ref name="Leslie2014p66"/&gt; is the sixth avatar among the [[Dashavatara]] of the preserver god [[Vishnu]] in [[Hinduism]]. He is believed to be one of the ''[[Chiranjivi|Chiranjeevis]]'' (Immortals), who will appear at the end of the ''[[Kali Yuga]]'' to be the guru of Vishnu's tenth and last incarnation, [[Kalki]]. 

Born to [[Jamadagni]] and [[Renuka]], the [[Brahmin]] Parashurama was foretold to appear at a time when overwhelming evil prevailed on the earth. The [[Kshatriya]] class, with weapons and power, had begun to abuse their power, take what belonged to others by force and tyrannise people. He corrected the cosmic equilibrium by destroying the Kshatriya warriors twenty-one times. He is married to Dharani, an incarnation of [[Lakshmi]], the wife of Vishnu.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Coulter|first1=Charles Russell |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sEIngqiKOugC&amp;q=Dharani&amp;pg=PA285|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities |last2=Turner |first2=Patricia |date=2013-07-04 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-96390-3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is present in the Ramayana due to the conflict with [[Rama]] (the protagonist of the Ramayana) over Shiva's broken bow.

According to [[Hindu mythology]], Parashurama was born to the sage [[Jamadagni]] and his [[Kshatriya]] wife, [[Renuka]], living in a hut (believed in local tradition to be located at [[Janapav]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Parashurama|title = Parashurama &amp;#124; Hindu mythology}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had a celestial cow called [[Surabhi]], which gives them all that they desire (Surabhi is the daughter of cow ''[[Kamadhenu]]'').&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p500" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Khazan Ecosystems of Goa: Building on Indigenous Solutions to Cope with Global Environmental Change (Advances in Asian Human-Environmental Research)|title = Khazan Ecosystems of Goa: Building on Indigenous Solutions to Cope with Global Environmental Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-r_EBAAAQBAJ&amp;q=parashurama+was+saraswath+brahmin&amp;pg=PA29|year=1995|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-9400772014|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A king named [[Kartavirya Arjuna]] (not to be confused with [[Arjuna]], the Pandava)&lt;ref name="Leslie2014p64" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|The ''Mahabharata'' includes legends about both Arjuna, one is dharmic (moral) and other adharmic (immoral); in some versions, Arjuna Kartavirya has mixed moral-immoral characteristics consistent with the Hindu belief that there is varying degrees of good and evil in every person.&lt;ref name="Leslie2014p64"/&gt;}} – learns about this cow of plenty and wants it.

The warrior class challenges him, and he slays every single member of the class, save for those belonging to the lineages of [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] and [[Ikshvaku]]. The mighty son of Jamadagni, having rid the world of the Kshatriyas, then performs the [[Ashvamedha]] sacrifice. He grants the earth with the seven islands to principal [[Rishi|rishis]] belonging to the Brahmin class. Having renounced the earth and his violent deeds, he retires to the hermitage of Nara-Narayana to engage in penance. The legend likely has roots in the ancient conflict between the Brahmin [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]], with knowledge duties, and the Kshatriya varna, with warrior and enforcement roles.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006p324" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p500" /&gt;&lt;ref name="donaldson159"&gt;{{cite book|author= Thomas E Donaldson|editor= Umakant Premanand Shah|title=Studies in Jaina Art and Iconography and Allied Subjects in Honour of Dr. U.P.

=== Parashurama in geographical myths ===
[[File:Parshuramsaraswats.jpg|thumb|left|Parasurama, surrounded by settlers, commanding Lord [[Varuna]], God of the waters to recede to make land known as '''Parasurama Kshetra''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' from Gokarna to Kanyakumari for the Brahmins.]]
There are legends dealing with the origins of the western coast geographically and culturally. One such legend is the retrieval of the West Coast from the sea, by Parashurama, a warrior sage. It proclaims that [[Parasurama|Parashurama]], an [[Dashavatara|Incarnation]] of [[Mahavishnu]], threw His battle axe into the sea. As a result, the land of the Western coast arose, and thus was reclaimed from the waters. The place from which he threw his axe (or shot an arrow) is on Salher fort (the second highest peak and the highest fort in Maharashtra) in the Baglan taluka of Nashik district of Maharashtra. There is a temple on the summit of this fort dedicated to Parshuram and there are footprints in the rock 4 times the size of normal humans. This fort on a lower plateau has a temple of goddess Renuka, Parshuram's mother and also a Yagya Kunda with pits for poles to erect a shamiyana on the banks of a big water tank. 

According to the Sangam classic ''[[Purananuru]]'', the [[Chera dynasty|Chera]] king [[Senguttuvan|Senkuttuvan]] conquered the lands between [[Kanyakumari]] and the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Kerala History and its Makers |last=Menon |first=A.

Bhatt, Gopal K. Bhargava (2006) "Land and People of Indian States and Union Territories: Volume 14.", p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;). Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from [[Gokarna, India|Gokarna]] to [[Kanyakumari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aiya VN |title=The Travancore State Manual |publisher=Travancore Government Press |pages=210–12 |year=1906 |access-date=12 November 2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RdzaPW-kEvQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. [[P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar]] has theorised that [[Senguttuvan]] may have been inspired by the [[Parasurama|Parashurama]] legend, which was brought by early Aryan settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=History of the Tamils: From the Earliest Times to 600 A.D. |last=Srinivisa Iyengar |first=P.

With respect towards the holy river, he constructs a Shiva linga and performs pooja and the temple is named as Rameshwara temple. The place where Parashurama cleaned his axe is called Ramakunda.

He plays important roles in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' serving as mentor to [[Bhishma]] (chapter 5.178), [[Drona]] (chapter 1.121) and [[Karna]] (chapter 3.286), teaching weapon arts and helping key warriors in both sides of the war.&lt;ref name="Karna the conqueror of the entire world"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03252.htm|title=Mahabaratha, Digvijaya yatra of Karna |date=1896 |publisher=Sacred Texts|work=The Mahabharata|access-date=11 June 2015|author=Kisari Mohan Ganguli}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Thomas |editor=Julia Leslie|title=Myth and Mythmaking: Continuous Evolution in Indian Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QrLKAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-77881-0|pages=66–69 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The Sanskrit epic uses multiple names for Parashurama in its verses: Parashurama, Jamadagnya, Rama (his name shortened, but not to be confused with [[Rama]] of Ramayana), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Thomas|editor=Julia Leslie|title=Myth and Mythmaking: Continuous Evolution in Indian Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QrLKAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-77881-0|pages=69–71 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Samanta Panchaka ===
According to the [[Adi Parva#Structure &amp; Chapters|Sangraha Parva]], after killing 21 generations of Kshatriyas, he filled their blood in five pools collectively known as the ''Samantha Panchaka'' (Sanskrit: समंत पञ्चक). He later atoned for his sin by severe penance. The five pools are considered to be holy.

The [[Adi Parva#Structure &amp; Chapters|Anukramanika Parva]] says that the Samantha Panchaka is located somewhere around Kurukshetra. It also mentions that the Pandavas performed a few religious rites near the Samantha Panchaka before the Mahabharat War at Kurukshetra.

==Parashurama Kshetra==
There is much interpretation of 'Parashurama Kshetra' (Land of Parasurama) mentioned in the [[Puranas]].

The region on the western coast of India from [[Gokarna, Karnataka|Gokarna]] to [[Kanyakumari]] was known as Parashurama Kshetra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=L Eck|first=Diana|title=India : A Sacred Geography|publisher=Harmony/Rodale|date=27 March 2012 |page=37 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region of [[Konkan]] was also considered as Parashurama Kshetra.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Wolpert (2006), Encyclopedia of India, Thomson Gale, {{ISBN|0-684-31350-2}}, page 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient [[Coastal South West India|Saptakonkana]] is a slightly larger region described in the Sahyadrikhanda which refers to it as Parashuramakshetra (Sanskrit for "The Land Of Parashurama"), [[Vapi]] to [[Tapi district|Tapi]] is an area of South [[Gujarat]], India. This area is called "Parshuram Ni Bhoomi".&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;{{cite book|last = Chandra|first=Suresh |title=Encyclopedia of Hindu Gods &amp; Goddesses |publisher= Sarup &amp; Sons|year= 1998|page= 376|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mfTE6kpz6XEC|isbn=9788176250399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:2 iconographic representations of Parasurama.jpg|thumb|right|Parashurama with his axe (two representations)]]
The Hindu literature on iconography such as the ''Vishnudharmottara Purana'' and ''Rupamandana'' describes him as a man with matted locks, with two hands, one carrying an axe. However, the ''[[Agni Purana]]'' portrays his iconography with four hands, carrying his axe, bow, arrow and sword. The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' describes his icon as one with four hands, carrying his axe, bow, arrows and a shield like a warrior.&lt;ref name="donaldson178"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas E Donaldson|editor=Umakant Premanand Shah|title=Studies in Jaina Art and Iconography and Allied Subjects in Honour of Dr. U.P.

Typically, he is shown with two hands, with an axe in his right hand either seated or standing.&lt;ref name="donaldson178" /&gt;

In [[Kannada]] folklore, especially in devotional songs sung by the [[Devdasi]]s he is often referred to as a son of [[Yellamma]].

'''Brihaspati''' ({{lang-sa|बृहस्पति}}, {{IAST3|Bṛhaspati}}), also known as '''Guru''', is a [[Deva (Hinduism)|Hindu deity]]. In the ancient [[Vedic scriptures]] of Hinduism, Brihaspati is a deity associated with [[Agni|fire]], and the word also refers to a [[rishi]] (sage) who counsels the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] (gods).&lt;ref name="lochtefeld127" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CoulterTurner2013p108"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Russell Coulter|author2=Patricia Turner|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sEIngqiKOugC&amp;pg=PA108 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-96390-3|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Slaje|title=Abhandlungen für die Kunde des Morgenlandes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fD0Ypvxmzj8C|year=2008|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-05645-8|pages=157 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some later texts, the word refers to the largest planet of the solar system, [[Jupiter]], and the deity is associated with the planet as a [[Navagraha]].&lt;ref name="lochtefeld127" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p86"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;pg=PA86| year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|page=86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sage==
Brihaspati appears in the [[Rigveda]] (pre-1000 BCE), such as in the dedications to him in the hymn 50 of Book 4;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_४.५० ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं ४.५०], Wikisource (Sanskrit text of Rigveda)&lt;/ref&gt; he is described as a sage born from the first great light, the one who drove away darkness, is bright and pure, and carries a special bow whose string is ''[[Ṛta|Rta]]'' or "cosmic order" (basis of [[dharma]]).&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p86"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hervey De Witt Griswold|title=The Religion of the Ṛigveda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vhkt5K1fw2wC&amp;pg=PA168|year=1971|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0745-7|pages=168–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; His knowledge and character is revered, and he is considered [[Guru]] (teacher) by all the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]].&lt;ref name=lochtefeld127&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

His wife is [[Tara (Hindu goddess)|Tara]] (or goddess who personifies the stars in the sky).&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p86"/&gt;

The reverence for sage Brihaspati endured through the medieval period, and one of the many [[Dharmasastra]]s was named after him.{{Sfn|Robert Lingat|1973|page=277}}{{Sfn|Mandagadde Rama Jois|1984|pp=22}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benoy Kumar Sarkar |title=The Positive Background of Hindu Sociology |url=https://archive.org/details/positivebackgrou0000sark |url-access=registration |year=1985|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2664-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/positivebackgrou0000sark/page/192 192]–194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the manuscripts of ''Brihaspati Smriti'' (''{{IAST|Bṛhaspatismṛti}}'') have not survived into the modern era, its verses were cited in other Indian texts. Scholars have made an effort to extract these cited verses, thus creating a modern reconstruction of Bṛhaspatismriti.{{Sfn|Robert Lingat|1973|page=104}} Jolly and Aiyangar have gathered some 2,400 verses of the lost Bṛhaspatismṛti text in this manner.{{Sfn|Robert Lingat|1973|page=104}} Brihaspati Smriti was likely a larger and more comprehensive text than [[Manusmriti]],{{Sfn|Robert Lingat|1973|page=104}} and the available evidence suggests that the discussion of the judicial process and jurisprudence in Brihaspati Smriti was often cited.{{Sfn|Patrick Olivelle|2006|page=188}}{{Sfn|Robert Lingat|1973|pages=14, 109–110, 180–189}}

===Brihaspati sutras===
''Brihaspati sutras'', also called the ''[[Barhaspatya sutras]]'', is an ancient Sanskrit text named after its author Brihaspati, known for its theories of materialism and anti-theism.{{Sfn|Bhattacharya|2002}}&lt;ref&gt;Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/G9TDl1xiCgU Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20170625155138/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9TDl1xiCgU Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{Citation|last=YaleUniversity|title=Dwight H.

Some scholars suggest that ''Brihaspati sutras'' are named after Brihaspati in the Vedas, but other scholars dispute this theory because the text rejects the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane Fowler|editor=A.

==Planet==

Brihaspati as a planet ([[Jupiter]]) appears in various Hindu astronomical texts in [[Sanskrit]], such as the 5th century ''Aryabhatiya'' by [[Aryabhata]], the 6th century ''Romaka'' by Latadeva and ''Panca Siddhantika'' by Varahamihira, the 7th century ''Khandakhadyaka'' by Brahmagupta and the 8th century ''Sisyadhivrddida'' by Lalla.&lt;ref name="Burgess1989vii"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ebenezer Burgess|editor=P Ganguly, P Sengupta|title=Sûrya-Siddhânta: A Text-book of Hindu Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0Uo_-_iizwC|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprint), Original: Yale University Press, American Oriental Society|isbn=978-81-208-0612-2|pages=vii–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; These texts present Brihaspati as one of the planets and estimate the characteristics of the respective planetary motion.&lt;ref name="Burgess1989vii"/&gt; Other texts such as ''Surya Siddhanta'' dated to have been complete sometime between the 5th century and 10th century present their chapters on various planets with deity mythologies.&lt;ref name="Burgess1989vii"/&gt;

The manuscripts of these texts exist in slightly different versions, present Brihaspati's motion in the skies, but vary in their data, suggesting that the text were open and revised over their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lionel D. Barnett|title=Antiquities of India: An Account of the History and Culture of Ancient Hindustan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x40mwFwgK44C&amp;pg=PA190 |year=1994|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0530-5 |pages=190–192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The texts slightly disagree in their data, in their measurements of Brihaspati's revolutions, apogee, epicycles, nodal longitudes, orbital inclination, and other parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ebenezer Burgess|editor=P Ganguly, P Sengupta|title=Sûrya-Siddhânta: A Text-book of Hindu Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0Uo_-_iizwC|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprint), Original: Yale University Press, American Oriental Society|isbn=978-81-208-0612-2|pages=ix–xi, xxix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=J Fleet | title=Arbhatiya|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1LssAAAAIAAJ|year=1911|pages=794–799}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, both ''Khandakhadyaka'' and ''Surya Siddhanta'' of Varaha state that Brihaspati completes 364,220 revolutions every 4,320,000 earth years, an Epicycle of Apsis as 32 degrees, and had an apogee (aphelia) of 160 degrees in 499 CE; while another manuscript of ''Surya Siddhanta'' accepts the revolutions to be 364,220, but revises the apogee to 171 degrees and 16 seconds and the Epicycle slightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ebenezer Burgess|editor=P Ganguly, P Sengupta|title=Sûrya-Siddhânta: A Text-book of Hindu Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0Uo_-_iizwC|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprint), Original: Yale University Press, American Oriental Society|isbn=978-81-208-0612-2|pages=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st millennium CE Hindu scholars had estimated the time it took for sidereal revolutions of each planet including Brihaspati, from their astronomical studies, with slightly different results:&lt;ref name="Burgess198926"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ebenezer Burgess|editor=P Ganguly, P Sengupta|title=Sûrya-Siddhânta: A Text-book of Hindu Astronomy|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W0Uo_-_iizwC|year=1989|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprint), Original: Yale University Press, American Oriental Society|isbn=978-81-208-0612-2|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval mythologies particularly those associated with [[Hindu astrology]], Brihaspati has a second meaning and refers to [[Planets in astrology#Jupiter|Jupiter]].&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p86"/&gt;&lt;ref name=lochtefeld127/&gt; It became the root of the word 'Brihaspativara' or [[Thursday]] in the Hindu calendar.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p86"/&gt; Brihaspati as Jupiter is part of the [[Navagraha]] in Hindu zodiac system, considered auspicious and benevolent. The word "Thursday" in the Greco-Roman and other Indo-European calendars is also dedicated to planet Jupiter (god of sky and thunder).{{Sfn|Yukio Ohashi|1999|pp=719–721}}{{Sfn|Pingree|1973|pp=2–3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Erik Gregersen|title=The Britannica Guide to the History of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qZ3zVmLUcjcC|year=2011|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-61530-127-0|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their zodiac signs being nearly identical.

'''Nirṛti''' ({{Lang-sa|निरृति|translit=Nirṛti}}) sometimes spelled '''Nirruti''' or '''Nirriti''', is a [[Hindu deity]], personifying death, decay, and sorrow. In [[Vedas|early Hindu scriptures]], Nirṛti is a [[Devi|goddess]] who is lives in the kingdom of the dead. In later Hinduism, Nirṛti and '''Nirṛta''' is also a [[Deva (Hinduism)|male god]], who is regarded as a [[Guardians of the directions|dikapala]] ("guardian of the directions") of the southwest.

==Etymology==

The Sanskrit word ''Nirṛti''  means 'decay' and is derived from ''nirṛ'' (lit. 'to separate'). It can be interpreted as meaning "devoid of ''[[ṛta|ṛta/i]]''", a state of disorder or chaos.&lt;ref name = "DM" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Witzel&gt;Witzel, Michael. “Macrocosm, Mesocosm, and Microcosm: The Persistent Nature of 'Hindu' Beliefs and Symbolic Forms.” International Journal of Hindu Studies, vol. 1, no. 3, 1997, pp. 501–539. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/20106493. Accessed 10 Mar. 2020.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name ''{{IAST|nirṛti}}'' has the meaning of "absence of [[ṛta]]", meaning 'disorder', or 'lawlessness', specifically the guardian to the absence of divine or cosmic disorder.&lt;ref name="Witzel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandra"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chandra|first=Suresh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mfTE6kpz6XEC&amp;q=Nirrti&amp;pg=PA154|title=Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses|date=1998|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=978-81-7625-039-9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This term was used in Vedic texts to indicate a realm of non-existence and absolute darkness, which threatened to consume those who failed in their duties to sacrifice and procreate. In ''nirṛti'', there was no light, no food, and no children: none of the necessary elements of Vedic life and ritual&lt;ref name="Witzel" /&gt;

==Goddess==
Nirṛti is mentioned in the hymns of the ''[[Rigveda]]'', mostly to seek protection from her or imploring for her during a possible departure. In one hymn (X.59), she is mentioned several times. This hymn, after summing up her nature, also asks for her in departure from the sacrificial site. In the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' (V.7.9), she is described as having golden locks. In the ''[[Taittiriya Brahmana]]'' (I.6.1.4), Nirṛtī is described as dark, dressed in dark clothes and her sacrificial shares are dark husks. In the sacred ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' (X.1.2.9), she is associated with the southwest quarter as her region. But elsewhere in the same text (V.2.3.3.) she is mentioned as living in the kingdom of the dead.&lt;ref name="kinsley"&gt;Kinsley, David (1987, reprint 2005). ''Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0394-9}}, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharji, Sukumari (2000).

In later Hindu texts, Nirṛti was re-conceptualized as a deity. According to some texts, she is the wife of  [[Adharma]] (not-''[[dharma]]'') that signifies an important component of [[Prakṛti|Prakriti]] (nature) for the [[Purusha]] (human -beings) who dwell in forests and the mother of three [[rakshasa]]s—Mrityu (death), Bhaya (fear) and Mahabhaya (terror)—who were collectively referred to as Nairrita.&lt;ref name="Mani"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mani|first=Vettam|url=http://archive.org/details/puranicencyclopa00maniuoft|title=Puranic encyclopaedia : a comprehensive dictionary with special reference to the epic and Puranic literature|date=1975|publisher=Delhi : Motilal Banarsidass|others=Robarts - University of Toronto|page= 540}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other texts portray her as the daughter of Adharma and Himsa (violence, the opposite of [[Ahimsa]]); she married her brother—Arita (not-''[[ṛta]]'') and became the mother of [[Naraka]] (personification of the hell) and Bhaya.&lt;ref name=Witzel/&gt;&lt;ref name = "DM" &gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2iZICgAAQBAJ&amp;q=nir%E1%B9%9Bti+adharma&amp;pg=PT168|title=In Praise of the Goddess: The Devimahatmya and Its Meaning|date=2003-12-01|publisher=Nicolas-Hays, Inc.|isbn=978-0-89254-616-9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bhagavata Purana]] he is presented as a-prajaḥ (one without children) who takes Adharma and Mṛṣā (untruth), two of Brahma's sons or creations, as adopted sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Śrīmad-bhāgavatam 4.8.2|url=https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/4/8/2/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-12-12|website=vedabase.io|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some texts identify Nirṛti with other inauspicious goddess, [[Jyestha (goddess)|Jyeshtha]] or [[Alakshmi]].

According to [[Shiva Purana]], '''Batuk Bhairav''' or 'Vatuk Bhairav' is a group of gods who are worshipped before the commencement of the worship of [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;Saptahik Bartaman, Bartaman Private Ltd., 6, JBS Haldane Avenue, 700 105 (ed. 20 February 2015) p.1&lt;/ref&gt;
The gods were originally the sons of a great Brahmin devotee of Shiva. The Brahmin with his sincere worship had highly satisfied Shiva and He granted godly status to the sons of the [[Brahmin]]. Shiva then granted a boon that anyone who wanted to worship Him would have to first worship the sons of the Brahmin. These sons of the Brahmin came to be known as ‘’’Batuk Bhairav’’’.&lt;ref&gt;Saptahik Bartaman, Bartaman Private Ltd., 6, JBS Haldane Avenue, 700 105 (ed. 20 February 2015) p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], {{IAST|Garuda}} is a divine eagle-like sun bird and the king of birds.&lt;ref name=williams21&gt;{{cite book|author=George M.

In the ''Mahabharata'', Garutman is stated to be same as Garuda, then described as the one who is fast, who can shapeshift into any form and enter anywhere.&lt;ref name=dalal144/&gt; He is a powerful creature in the epics, whose wing flapping can stop the spinning of heaven, earth and hell.

Aruna is the charioteer of the [[Sun God|sun god]].

According to George Williams, Garuda has roots in the verb ''gri'', or speak.&lt;ref name="Williams2008p138"/&gt; He is a metaphor in the Vedic literature for ''Rik'' (rhythms), ''Saman'' (sounds), ''Yajna'' (sacrifices), and the ''atman'' (Self, deepest level of consciousness). In the Puranas, states Williams, Garuda becomes a literal embodiment of the idea, and the Self who attached to and inseparable from the Supreme Self (Vishnu).&lt;ref name="Williams2008p138"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyczkowski1988p40"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark S.

===Iconography===
[[File:Bharhut portable Garuda pillar.jpg|thumb|upright|Relief depicting a portable Garuda pillar, one of the oldest images of Garuda, [[Bharhut]], 100 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, The Roots of Indian Art, 1980, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Hindu texts on Garuda iconography vary in their details. If in the bird form, he is eagle-like, typically with the wings slightly open as if ready and willing to fly wherever he needs to.&lt;ref name=rao285/&gt; In part human-form, he may have an eagle-like nose, beak or legs, his eyes are open and big, his body is the color of emerald, and his wings are golden-yellow. He may be shown with either two or four hands.&lt;ref name=rao285/&gt; If he is not carrying Vishnu, he holds a jar of ''amrita'' (immortality nectar) in one hand in the rear and an umbrella in the other, while the front pair of hands are in ''anjali'' ([[namaste]]) posture. If he is carrying Vishnu, the rear hands provide the support for Vishnu's feet.&lt;ref name=rao285/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson2001p253"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas E. Donaldson|title=The iconography of Vaiṣṇava images in Orissa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BvqAAAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=DK Printworld|pages=253–259|isbn=9788124601730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the text ''Silparatna'', states Rao, Garuda is best depicted with only two hands and with four bands of colours: "golden yellow colour from feet to knees, white from knees to the navel, scarlet from navel to neck, and black above the neck". His hands, recommends the text, should be in ''abhaya'' (nothing to fear) posture.&lt;ref name=rao285/&gt; In ''Sritatvanidhi'' text, the recommended iconography for Garuda is a kneeling figure, who wears one or more serpents, pointed bird-beak like nose, his two hands in ''namaste'' posture. This style is commonly found in Hindu temples dedicated to Vishnu.&lt;ref name=rao285/&gt;

In some iconography, Garuda carries Lord Vishnu and his two consorts by his side: [[Lakshmi]](Thirumagal) and [[Bhūmi]] (Bhuma-Devi).&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p123"&gt;{{cite book |author=Roshen Dalal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNmfdAKFpkQC |title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-14-341517-6 |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garuda iconography is found in early temples of India, such as on the underside of the [[eave]] at Cave 3 entrance of the [[Badami cave temples]] (6th-century).&lt;ref name=rao285/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Michell|title=Badami, Aihole, Pattadakal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzTcoQEACAAJ| year=2015|publisher= Jaico Publishing|isbn=978-81-8495-600-9|pages=49–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythology===

Garuda's mythology is linked to that of [[Aruṇa|Aruna]] – the charioteer of [[Surya]] (The Hindu Sun god). Both Aruna and Garuda developed from an egg. According to one version related by George Williams, Kashyapa Prajapati's two wives [[Vinata]] and [[Kadru]] wanted to have children, and [[Kashyapa]] granted each of them a boon.&lt;ref name="Williams2008p62"/&gt; Kadru asked for one thousand [[Nāga]] sons, while Vinata asked for just two, but each an equal to all of Kadru's thousand sons. Kashyapa blessed them, and then retreated to a forest to meditate. Later, Kadru gave birth to one thousand eggs, while Vinata gave birth to two eggs. After incubating them for five hundred years, Kadru's eggs hatched and out came her 1,000 sons. Vinata, eager for her own sons, impatiently broke one of her eggs. From this egg emerged the partially formed Aruna, looking radiant and reddish as the morning sun - but not as bright as the midday sun as he was promised to be.&lt;ref name="Williams2008p62"&gt;{{cite book|author=George M. Williams|title=Handbook of Hindu Mythology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7LOZfwCDpEC |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-533261-2|pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= [https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada/page/70 70]|editor=K.S.

Aruna then left to become the charioteer of Surya, the sun god.

Vinata waited, and after many years the second egg hatched, and Garuda was born. After losing a bet to Kadru through trickery, Vinata was forced to become her slave. Garuda later on asked his brothers to free his mother from her slavery, to which they demanded Amrita from heaven. Garuda waged a war against gods with his extraordinary might and abilities beyond thinking, and defeated all of them, including [[Indra]]. He then took Indra's nectar vessel and flew back to earth. Vishnu then came to Garuda, and asked him to be his ride, to which he agreed. Indra requested that Garuda not give the [[Amrita]] to the [[Nāga|Nagas]] though, as it would bring great trouble later, so they forged a plan. Upon reaching his brothers Garuda placed the vessel before them, and asked them to first purify themselves before drinking. Meanwhile, [[Jayanta]] (the son of Indra) stole the vessel back. On returning, the nagas were all devoured by Garuda.&lt;ref name="Williams2008p62"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ashok, Banker K|title=Forest of Stories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3sQqQQhe5aQC|pages=173–175|access-date=6 March 2013|year= 2012|publisher= Westland|isbn=978-93-81626-37-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garuda is presented in the Mahabharata as one who eats snake meat, such as the story about him planning to kill and eat Sumukha snake, where [[Indra]] intervenes. Garuda in anger, vaunt about his feats and compares himself to Indra's equal. Vishnu teaches lesson to Garuda and cured his pride on might.&lt;ref name="Buitenen1973p167"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Adrianus Bernardus Buitenen|title=The Mahabharata, Volume 3 (Book 4: The Book of the Virata; Book 5: The Book of the Effort) |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wFtXBGNn0aUC&amp;pg=PA167 |year=1973|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-84665-1|pages=167–168, 389–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garudas are also a race of birds who devour snakes in the epic.&lt;ref name="Buitenen1973p167"/&gt;

The ''[[Suparṇākhyāna]]'', a late [[Vedic period]] poem considered to be among the "earliest traces of epic poetry in India," relates the legend of Garuda, and provides the basis for a later, expanded version which appears within the ''[[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]]''.&lt;ref name="Winternitz1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Moriz Winternitz|title=A History of Indian Literature, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JRfuJFRV_O8C&amp;pg=PA292|year=1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0264-3|pages=291–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vogel1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Philippe Vogel|title=Indian Serpent-lore: Or, The Nāgas in Hindu Legend and Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caskYEbIQDoC&amp;pg=PA53|year=1995|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-1071-2|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===
Garuda's links to Vishnu – the Hindu god who fights injustice and destroys evil in his various [[avatar]]s to preserve [[dharma]], has made him an iconic symbol of king's duty and power, an insignia of royalty or dharma. His eagle-like form is shown either alone or with Vishnu, signifying divine approval of the power of the state.&lt;ref name="Williams2008p138"/&gt; He is found on the faces of many early Hindu kingdom coins with this symbolism, either as a single-headed bird or a three-headed bird that watches all sides.&lt;ref name="Bajpai2004p19"&gt;{{cite book|author=K. D. Bajpai|title=Indian Numismatic Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=chGrJUMarHoC |date=October 2004|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-035-8|pages=19–24, 84–85, 120–124, 148-149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Mahabharata, Garuda is invoked as a symbol of impetuous violent force, speed, and martial prowess. Powerful warriors advancing rapidly on doomed foes are likened to Garuda swooping down on a serpent. Defeated warriors are like snakes beaten down by Garuda.  The Mahabharata character [[Drona]] uses a military formation named after Garuda. [[Krishna]] even carries the image of Garuda on his banner.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Buddhism==
[[File:Garuda vanquishing the Naga clan. Gandhara. Met.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Garuda vanquishing the [[nāga|Naga]] clan, a [[Gandhara]] artwork, second century CE.]]
Garuda, also referred to as ''Garula'', are golden-winged birds in Buddhist texts. Under the [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|Buddhist concept]] of ''[[saṃsāra]]'', they are one of the [[Eight Legions|Aṣṭagatyaḥ]], the eight classes of inhuman beings. In Buddhist art, they are shown as sitting and listening to the sermons of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Lopez314"/&gt; They are enemies of the [[Nāgas]] (snakes) and are sometimes depicted with a serpent held between their claws. Like the Hindu art, both zoomorphic (giant eagle-like bird) and partially anthropomorphic (part bird, part human) iconography is common across Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref name="Lopez314"/&gt;

[[File:Garuda (Koh Ker style).jpg|thumbnail|upright|Garuda ({{lang-km|គ្រុឌ}}, {{lang|km-Latn|Krŭd}}) in [[Koh Ker]] style. Made of sandstone, this statue is from the first half of tenth century, ([[Angkor|Angkor period]]). On display at the [[National Museum of Cambodia]].]]
In [[Buddhist mythology|Buddhism]], the Garuda (Sanskrit; [[Pāli]]: {{IAST|garuḷā}}) are enormous predatory birds with a wingspan of 330 [[yojana]]s.&lt;ref name="Lopez314"/&gt; They are described as beings with intelligence and social organization. They are also sometimes known as {{IAST|suparṇa}} (Sanskrit; Pāli: {{IAST|supaṇṇa}}), meaning "well-winged, having good wings".  Like the [[Nāgas]], they combine the characteristics of animals and divine beings, and may be considered to be among the lowest of the [[Deva (Buddhism)|devas]].&lt;ref name="Lopez314"/&gt; The Garudas have kings and cities, and at least some of them have the magical power of changing into human form when they wish to have dealings with people. On some occasions Garuda kings have had romances with human women in this form. Their dwellings are in groves of the ''simbalī'', or [[Bombax ceiba|silk-cotton tree]].

Jataka stories describe them to be residents of Nagadipa or Seruma.&lt;ref name="Lopez314"/&gt;

The Garuda are enemies to the [[Naga (mythology)|nāga]], a race of intelligent serpent- or dragon-like beings, whom they hunt.  The Garudas at one time caught the nāgas by seizing them by their heads; but the nāgas learned that by swallowing large stones, they could make themselves too heavy to be carried by the Garudas, wearing them out and killing them from exhaustion.  This secret was divulged to one of the Garudas by the ascetic Karambiya, who taught him how to seize a nāga by the tail and force him to vomit up his stone (Pandara Jātaka, J.518).

The Garudas were among the beings appointed by [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]] to guard Mount [[Sumeru]] and the [[Trayastrimsa|{{IAST|Trāyastriṃśa}}]] heaven from the attacks of the [[Asura (Buddhism)|asuras]].

[[File:Garuda_Thap_Mam_13th_c.jpg|thumb|upright|left|13th century [[Art of Champa|Cham]] sculpture depicts Garuda devouring a [[Naga (mythology)|nāga]] serpent.]]
In the Maha-samaya Sutta (Digha Nikaya 20), the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] is shown making temporary peace between the Nagas and the Garudas.

In the [[Qing dynasty]] fiction ''[[Yue Fei#The Story of Yue Fei|The Story of Yue Fei]]'' (1684), Garuda sits at the head of the Buddha's throne. But when a celestial bat (an embodiment of the [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius constellation]]) flatulates during the Buddha's expounding of the [[Lotus Sutra]], Garuda kills her and is exiled from paradise. He is later reborn as [[Song dynasty]] General [[Yue Fei]]. The bat is reborn as Lady Wang, wife of the [[Hanjian|traitor]] Prime Minister [[Qin Hui (Song dynasty)|Qin Hui]], and is instrumental in formulating the "Eastern Window" plot that leads to Yue's eventual political execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hsia|first=C.T.|title=C.

[[File:Garuda by Ida Made Tlaga 19th c.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Garuda according to Ida Made Tlaga, a 19th-century [[Bali]]nese artist.]]
In India and the rest of [[Southeast Asia]] the eagle symbolism is represented by Garuda, a large bird with eagle-like features that appears in both Hindu and Buddhist epic as the [[vahana]] (vehicle) of the god [[Vishnu]]. Garuda became the national [[emblem of Thailand]] and [[Garuda Pancasila|Indonesia]]; [[Thailand]]'s Garuda is rendered in a more traditional anthropomorphic style, while that of [[Indonesia]] is rendered in heraldic style with traits similar to the real [[Javan hawk-eagle]].

[[Indonesia]] uses the Garuda in a form called the ''[[National emblem of Indonesia|Garuda Pancasila]]'' as its [[Coat of arms of Indonesia|national symbol]]. It is somewhat intertwined with the concept of the [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]]. The Garuda Pancasila is coloured black or [[Gilding|gilded]], symbolizing both the greatness of the nation and the ''elang Jawa'' ([[Javan hawk-eagle]] ''Nisaetus bartelsi'').

{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2020}}

'''Virabahu''' ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: {{IAST|Vīrabāhu}}) is a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity. He is considered to be the commander-in-chief of [[Kartikeya|Murugan's]] army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALUvDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA231|title=Historical Dictionary of the Tamils|last=Ramaswamy|first=Vijaya|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2017 |isbn=978-1-53810-686-0|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is regarded in Tamil tradition to be one of the nine commanders (''Navaveerargal'') who were born to serve Murugan. Among the nine commanders, Virabahu is ranked the highest. He is worshipped mostly in [[Tamil Nadu]].

==Legend==
{{Hindu mythology}}
According to the [[Skanda Purana]], after the birth of Murugan, Shakti took her s''ilambu'' (anklet) nine shaktis were produced, and these were then transformed into the brothers of Murugan, called the ''Navaveeragal'' (lit. "nine warriors") in Tamil.

When Murugan was sent to destroy [[Śūrapadmā|Surapadman]], Virabahu and the other ''Navaveeragal'' followed him south, at the head of a huge army. At the Vindhyas, the army saw two of Surapadman's brothers - Krauncha, in the form of a mountain, and [[Tārakāsura|Tarakasura]]. Virabahu and his army attacked Tarakasura, but he laid a spell on them that made them go into Krauncha. After news was brought to Murugan of the defeat, he fought Tarakasura and pierced him with his heart. He then threw his ''[[Vel]]'' at Krauncha, who dissolved into dust. Afterwards, Virabahu and his army were restored to life.

Virabahu arrived at Surapadman's capital, Mahendrapuri, to ask for the release of the devas who were imprisoned by him after he conquered their world, so that war would not occur. He entered the palace and spoke to the devas imprisoned, saying that they were imprisoned for their sins and they would be saved by Murugan soon. Virabahu then arrived in Surapadman's throne room, but was insulted in being ignored and not offered a seat, as the laws of messengers demanded. However, Virabahu conjured a magnificent throne, and delivered his message for Surapadman to release the followers of [[Thirumal]]. Surapadman refused and attempted to imprison Virabahu as well. During his escape, he killed many asuras, including some of Surapadman's relatives, and informed Murugan of what had occurred.

Virabahu then fought in the war. One of Banukopan's weapons made him fall into a swoon along with much of the army, but after the [[Astra (weapon)|astra]] was destroyed, he recovered. He accompanied Murugan on his return and during his weddings.

{{Short description|Metaphysical concept, Supreme Brahman in Hinduism}}
{{EngvarB|date=March 2015}}

{{hinduphilosophy}}
'''''Para Brahman''''' ({{lang-sa|परब्रह्म|translit=parabrahma|translit-std=IAST}}) in [[Hindu philosophy]] is the "Supreme [[Brahman]]" that which is beyond all descriptions and conceptualisations. It is described as the formless (in the sense that it is devoid of [[Maya (religion)|Maya]]) that eternally pervades everything, everywhere in the universe and whatever is beyond.&lt;ref name="PalHuyler2016p55"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pratapaditya Pal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NXolDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55|title=Puja and Piety: Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist Art from the Indian Subcontinent|author2=Stephen P. Huyler|author3=John E. Cort|publisher=University of California Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-520-28847-8|pages=55–56|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Param Brahma is conceptualised in diverse ways. In the [[Advaita Vedanta]] tradition, the Param Brahma is a synonym of ''nirguna brahman'', i.e., the attribute-less Absolute. Conversely, in [[Dvaita Vedanta]] and [[Vishishtadvaita|Vishistadvaita Vedanta]] traditions, the Param Brahma is defined as ''[[saguna brahman]]'', i.e., the Absolute with attributes. In [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]] and [[Shaktism]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]] and [[Adi Shakti]] respectively are Param Brahma.{{sfn|White|1970|p=156}} [[Mahaganapati]] is considered as Param Brahma by the [[Ganapatya]] sect. [[Kartikeya]] is considered as Param Brahma by the Kartikeya sect.

==Etymology==
''Para'' is a Sanskrit word that means "higher" in some contexts, and "highest or supreme" in others.&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European languages, Oxford University Press, Article on ''Para''&lt;/ref&gt;

''Brahman'' in Hinduism connotes the Absolute, the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Ultimate Reality]] in the universe.&lt;ref name=james122&gt;James Lochtefeld, ''Brahman'', The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ptraju&gt;PT Raju (2006), Idealistic Thought of India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1406732627}}, page 426 and Conclusion chapter part XII&lt;/ref&gt; In major schools of Hindu philosophy it is the immaterial, efficient, formal and final [[Four causes|cause]] of all that exists.&lt;ref name=ptraju/&gt;&lt;ref name=fxclooney&gt;For dualism school of Hinduism, see: Francis X. Clooney (2010), Hindu God, Christian God: How Reason Helps Break Down the Boundaries between Religions, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199738724}}, pages 51-58, 111-115;&lt;br&gt;For monist school of Hinduism, see: B Martinez-Bedard (2006), Types of Causes in Aristotle and Sankara, Thesis - Department of Religious Studies (Advisors: Kathryn McClymond and Sandra Dwyer), Georgia State University, pages 18-35&lt;/ref&gt; Brahman is a key concept found in the [[Vedas]] and is extensively discussed in the early [[Upanishads]]&lt;ref name=sphilips&gt;Stephen Philips (1998), Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Brahman to Derrida (Editor; Edward Craig), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415187077}}, pages 1-4&lt;/ref&gt; and in Advaita Vedanta literature.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Comans (2002), The Method of Early Advaita Vedānta, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120817227}}, pages 129-130, 216-231&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advaita Vedanta==
In Advaita Vedanta, the Para Brahman is defined as ''nirguna brahman'', or Brahman without form or qualities.{{sfn|Sullivan|2001|p=148}}{{sfn|Fisher|2012|p=116}}{{sfn|Malkovsky|1997|p=541}} It is a state of complete knowledge of self as being identical with the transcendental Brahman, a state of mental-spiritual enlightenment (Jnana yoga).{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=13}} It contrasts with Saguna Brahman which is a state of loving awareness (Bhakti yoga).{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=13}} Advaita Vedanta non-dualistically holds that Brahman is divine, the Divine is Brahman, and this is identical to that which is [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (one's soul, innermost self) and nirguna (attribute-less), infinite, love, truth, knowledge, "being-consciousness-bliss".{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|pp=9-14}}

According to Eliot Deutsch, ''Nirguna Brahman'' is a "state of being"{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=12}} in which all dualistic distinctions between one's own soul and Brahman are obliterated and are overcome.{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=13}} In contrast, ''Saguna Brahman'' is where the distinctions are harmonized after duality between one's own soul and Brahman has been accepted.{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=13}}

Advaita describes the features of a nondualistic experience,{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=13}} in which a subjective experience also becomes an "object" of knowledge and a phenomenal reality. The Absolute Truth is both subject and object, so there is no qualitative difference:
* "Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Paramātmā or Bhagavān." ([[Bhagavata Purana]] 1.2.11)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iskconpress.com/books/sb/1/2/11|title=Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 1.2.11|last=A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|''vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvam, yaj jnanam advayam brahmeti paramatmeti, bhagavan iti sabdyate''}}
* "Whoever realizes the Supreme Brahma attains to supreme felicity. That Supreme Brahma is Eternal Truth (satyam), Omniscient (jnanam), Infinite (anantam)." ([[Taittiriya Upanishad]] 2.1.1){{refn|group=note|''brahma-vid apnoti param, tad eshabhyukta, satyam jnanam anantam brahma''}}

The Upanishads state that the Supreme Brahma is Eternal, Conscious, and Blissful [[Satcitananda|sat-chit-ânanda]]. The realisation of this truth is the same as ''being'' this truth:
* "The One is Bliss. Whoever perceives the Blissful One, the reservoir of pleasure, becomes blissful forever." ([[Taittiriya Upanishad]] 2.7.1-2){{refn|group=note|''raso vai sa, rasam hy evayam labdhvanandi bhavati''}}
* "Verily know the Supreme One to be Bliss." ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 2.9.28)

==Vaishnavism ==
In Vaishnavism, Vishnu ([[Narayana]]) is considered as Para Brahman ([[Mahavishnu | Adinarayana]]). Vishnu in his [[Vishvarupa]] is considered to be the supreme. His abode is called [[Vaikuntha]] and the name there is Para Vasudeva . He is depicted as the only [[Adipurusha]] According to the [[Narayana sukta]] in the [[Yajurveda]] . Narayana, in Hinduism, is considered as the Supreme Truth (Brahman), the thousand-headed, thousand-eyed, and thousand-limbed creator and this hymn is sung to worship Narayana, the universal Self ([[Paramatman]]).

==Shaivism==
In [[Shaivism]], [[Shiva]] is Para Brahman. [[Parashiva]], the supreme form of Lord Shiva, is considered as Para Brahman. According to [[Shiva Purana]] , Parashiva is the single incarnation of all souls and deities. He is also depicted as the only [[Adipurusha]] or [[Shiva|Mahadeva]].{{Cn|date=December 2022}}

===Kashmir Shaivism===
{{main|Kashmir Shaivism}}

In Kashmir Shaivism, Svachhanda Bhairava is considered as the supreme form of Shiva. Kashmir Shaivism consider Svachhanda Bhairava as Para Brahman. Kashmir Shaivism holds ''[[turiya]]'', or the fourth state of consciousness, as the state of [[Brahman]]. It is neither wakefulness, dreaming, nor deep sleep. It exists in the junction between any of these three states, i.e. between waking and dreaming, between dreaming and deep sleep, and between deep sleep and waking. In Kashmir Shaivism there exists a fifth state of consciousness called Turiyatita - ''the state beyond Turiya'' which represents Parabrahman. Turiyatita, also called the void or [[Śūnyatā|shunya]] is the state where one attains liberation otherwise known as [[jivanmukta|jivanmukti]] or [[moksha]].{{Cn|date=December 2022}}

==Shaktism==
In [[Shaktism]], [[Adi Parashakti]] is considered to be the Para Brahman both with and without qualities, and also [[Brahman]] in its energetic state, the ultimate reality. According to Devi Suktam and Sri Suktam in [[Rigveda]] she is the womb of all creation. Thus Mahakali is epithets is Brahmamayi, meaning "She Whose Essence is Brahman". [[Tridevi]] is the supreme form of [[Adi Parashakti]]. Her eternal abode is called [[Manidvipa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Klostermaier|first=Klaus K.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CVviRghVtIC|title=Survey of Hinduism, A: Third Edition|date=2010-03-10|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8011-3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Sant Mat ==
In [[Sant Mat]] and [[Kabir panth]], Akshar Purush is called Parabrahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=volume7 |url=https://archive.org/details/volume7_202012/volume2/page/25/ |publisher=Volume 7 |access-date=26 August 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Parabrahman is other than Brahman so in the language of [[Saint|saints]], it is called Parabrahman (''Para = next''). He is perishable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ghat Ramayan |url=https://archive.org/details/ADictionaryOfReligionAndEthics1000022574/GHAT-RAMAYAN-Commentary%20by%20Baba%20Kehar%20Singh%20Ji/page/n93/mode/2up |publisher=ADictionary |access-date=26 August 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akshar Purush (''Parabrahman'') was originated by Achint (''a son of Satpurush'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ghat Ramayan |url=https://archive.org/details/ADictionaryOfReligionAndEthics1000022574/GHAT-RAMAYAN-Commentary%20by%20Baba%20Kehar%20Singh%20Ji/page/n83/mode/2up |publisher=ADictionary |access-date=26 August 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achint was assigned some work. For the help in his work, he created Akshar Purush (''Parabrahman''), but Akshar Purush had done some negligence in his work due to which he was expelled from Satlok along with the seven sankh Brahmands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sant Tulsi Sahib |url=https://archive.org/details/SantTulsiSahib/page/n23 |publisher=Archive.org |access-date=26 August 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rāhu''' ([[Sanskrit]]: [[:wikt:राहु#Sanskrit|राहु]], [[file:ascending node (bold).svg|16px|☊]]) is one of the nine major celestial bodies ([[navagraha]]) in Hindu texts and the king of meteors.&lt;ref name=dalalrahu&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|page=324 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the ascension of the moon in its precessional orbit around the earth, also referred as the north lunar node, and along with [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]], is a "shadow planet" that causes eclipses. Despite having no physical existence, Rahu has been allocated the status of the planet by ancient seers owing to its strong influence in astrology.

Rahu is usually paired with [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]], another shadow planet. The time of day considered to be under the influence of Rahu is called ''[[Rahu kala|Rāhu kāla]]'' and is considered inauspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= [https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada/page/77 77]|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As per Hindu astrology, Rahu and Ketu have an orbital cycle of 18 years and are always 180 degrees from each other orbitally (as well as in the birth charts). This coincides with the precessional orbit of the moon or the ~18 year rotational cycle of the lunar ascending and descending nodes on the earth's ecliptic plane. This also corresponds to a [[saros (astronomy)|saros]], a period of approximately 223 synodic months (approximately 6585.3211 days, or 18 years, 11 days, 8 hours), that can be used to predict eclipses of the Sun and Moon. Rahu rules the zodiac sign of [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] together with [[Shani]].

Astronomically, Rahu and Ketu denote the points of intersection of the paths of the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]] as they move on the [[celestial sphere]]. Therefore, Rahu and Ketu are respectively called the north and the south [[lunar node]]s. [[Eclipse]]s occur when the Sun and the Moon are at one of these points, giving rise to the understanding of swallowing of the Sun and the Moon by the snake. Rahu is responsible for causing the [[Eclipse of the Sun]].

== Legends ==
{{expand section|date=February 2018}}
{{main|Samudra Manthana}}

Rahu is mentioned in the Puranic texts.&lt;ref name="Dimmitt2012p347"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cornelia Dimmitt|title=Classical Hindu Mythology: A Reader in the Sanskrit Puranas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=re7CR2jKn3QC |year=2012|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-4399-0464-0|pages=75, 347–349}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tales begin in the "remotest periods of the earliest of time, when the devas and asuras churned the [[Kshir Sagar|ocean of milk]] to extract from it the [[amrita]], the elixir of immortality."&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Zimmer, ''Myth and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilisation.'' New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1946, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mohini]], the female avatar of [[Vishnu]], started distributing amrita to the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]]. However, one of the asuras, [[Svarbhānu|Svarbhanu]], sat in the row of devas and drank the amrita. Surya and Chandra noticed him and they informed Mohini; however, by that time, Svarbhanu had already become immortal. Vishnu, as Mohini, cut off Svarbhanu's head with the [[Sudarshana Chakra|Sudarshana]] Chakra. Svarbhanu, henceforth referred to as Rahuketu, could not die, but his head was separated from his body and his head came to be known as Rahu, while his body came to be known as Ketu. Following this event, Rahu and Ketu were given the responsibility to influence the lives of the humans on [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="Dimmitt2012p347" /&gt;

== Astrology ==
Since Rahu and Ketu are two opposite lunar nodes, they always appear in diametrically opposite [[House (astrology)|house]]s in [[horoscope]]s. Both nodes are always in retrograde motion.

In [[Hindu astrology]], Rahu represents materialism, mischief, fear, dissatisfaction, obsession and confusion. Rahu is also associated with politicians and occult sciences. Like Ketu, Rahu is also an enemy against the sun and moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://internetlk.com/rahu-kalaya/ |title=Rahu Kalaya {{!}} 2021 August - Daily Rahu Kalaya Sri Lanka |website=internetlk.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210803095800/https://internetlk.com/rahu-kalaya/ |archive-date=2021-08-03}} &lt;/ref&gt; It is generally considered as a malefic planet in astrology.

[[Jyotisha]] is Hindu astrology, which entails the concepts of [[Nakshatra]] (see also [[List of Natchathara temples]]), [[Navagraha]] (see also [[Navagraha temples|List of Navagraha temples)]], and [[Saptarishi]] (included in the [[list of Hindu deities]] whose [[List of Hindu temples|dedicated temples]] are found at various [[Hindu pilgrimage sites]] to which Hindus take [[yatra]]).

== Buddhist culture ==
Rāhu is mentioned explicitly in a pair of scriptures from the [[Samyutta Nikaya]] of the [[Pali Canon]]. In the Candima Sutta and the Suriya Sutta, Rahu attacks [[Surya]], the Sun deity and [[Chandra]], the Moon deity before being compelled to release them by their recitation of a brief stanza conveying their reverence for the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn02/sn02.009.piya.html Candima Sutta]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suriya Sutta"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn02/sn02.010.piya.html Suriya Sutta]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Buddha responds by enjoining Rāhu to release them, which Rāhu does rather than have his "head split into seven pieces".&lt;ref name="Suriya Sutta"/&gt; The verses recited by the two celestial deities and the Buddha have since been incorporated into Buddhist liturgy as protective verses recited by monks as prayers of protection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://internetlk.com/rahu-kalaya/Access to Insight; see the summary in the ''Devaputta-samyutta section'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Shiva is known as "The Destroyer" within the [[Trimurti]], the [[Hindus|Hindu]] trinity which also includes [[Brahma]] and [[Vishnu]].{{sfn|Zimmer|1972|pp=124–126}}{{sfn|Gonda|1969}} In the Shaivite tradition, Shiva is the Supreme Lord who creates, protects and transforms the universe.{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|p=65}}{{Sfn|Issitt|Main|2014|pp=147, 168}}{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=151}} In the goddess-oriented [[Shaktism|Shakta]] tradition, the Supreme Goddess ([[Devi]]) is regarded as the energy and creative power (Shakti) and the equal complementary partner of Shiva.{{sfn|Kinsley|1988|pp=50, 103–104}}{{sfn|Pintchman|2015|pp=113, 119, 144, 171}} Shiva is one of the five equivalent deities in [[Panchayatana puja]] of the [[Smarta Tradition|Smarta]] tradition of Hinduism.{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=17, 153}}

Shiva has many aspects, benevolent as well as fearsome. In benevolent aspects, he is depicted as an omniscient [[Yogi]] who lives an [[Asceticism#Hinduism|ascetic life]] on [[Mount Kailash]]{{sfn|Zimmer|1972|pp=124–126}} as well as a householder with his wife [[Parvati]] and his three children, [[Ganesha]], [[Kartikeya]] and [[Ashokasundari]]. In his fierce aspects, he is often depicted slaying demons. Shiva is also known as Adiyogi Shiva, regarded as the patron god of [[yoga]], [[Meditation#Hinduism|meditation]] and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;''Shiva Samhita'', e.g. {{harvnb|Mallinson|2007}}; {{harvnb|Varenne|1976|p=82}}; {{harvnb|Marchand|2007}} for Jnana Yoga.&lt;/ref&gt;

The iconographical attributes of Shiva are the serpent around his neck, the adorning [[crescent]] moon, the [[holy river]] [[Ganga]] flowing from his matted hair, the [[third eye]] on his forehead (the eye that turns everything in front of it into ashes when opened), the [[trishula]] or trident as his weapon, and the [[damaru]] drum. He is usually worshipped in the [[aniconic]] form of [[lingam]].{{sfn|Fuller|2004|p=58}}

Shiva has pre-Vedic roots,{{sfnm|Sadasivan|2000|1p=148|Sircar|1998|2pp=3 with footnote 2, 102–105}} and the figure of Shiva evolved as an amalgamation of various older non-Vedic and Vedic deities, including the [[Rigvedic deity|Rigvedic]] [[wind god|storm god]] [[Rudra]] who may also have non-Vedic origins,{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=152}} into a single major deity.{{sfnm|Flood|1996|1pp=148–149|Keay|2000|2p=xxvii|Granoff|2003|3pp=95–114|Nath|2001|4p=31}} Shiva is a pan-Hindu deity, revered widely by Hindus in [[Hinduism in India|India]], [[Hinduism in Nepal|Nepal]], [[Hinduism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] and [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Indonesia]] (especially in [[Java]] and [[Bali]]).{{sfnm|Keay|2000|1p=xxvii|Flood|1996|2p=17}}

== Etymology and other names ==
{{Main|Shiva Sahasranama}}
[[File:Elephanta Caves Trimurti.jpg|thumb|200px|An ancient sculpture of Shiva at the [[Elephanta Caves]], Maharashtra. 6th century CE]]
According to [[Monier Monier-Williams]], the Sanskrit word "{{transliteration|sa|ISO|śiva}}" ({{lang-sa|शिव|label=[[Devanagari]]}}, also transliterated as ''shiva'') means "auspicious, propitious, gracious, benign, kind, benevolent, friendly".&lt;ref name="mmwshiva"&gt;Monier Monier-Williams (1899), [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/1100/mw__1107.html Sanskrit to English Dictionary with Etymology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227192855/http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/1100/mw__1107.html |date=27 February 2017 }}, Oxford University Press, pp. 1074–1076&lt;/ref&gt; The root words of {{transliteration|sa|ISO|śiva}} in folk etymology are ''śī'' which means "in whom all things lie, pervasiveness" and ''va'' which means "embodiment of grace".&lt;ref name="mmwshiva" /&gt;{{sfn|Prentiss|2000|p=199}}

The word Shiva is used as an adjective in the Rig Veda ({{Circa|1700–1100 BCE}}), as an epithet for several [[Rigvedic deities]], including [[Rudra]].&lt;ref&gt;For use of the term ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|śiva}}'' as an epithet for other Vedic deities, see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term Shiva also connotes "liberation, final emancipation" and "the auspicious one"; this adjectival usage is addressed to many deities in Vedic literature.&lt;ref name="mmwshiva" /&gt;{{Sfn|Chakravarti|1986|pp=21–22}} The term evolved from the Vedic ''Rudra-Shiva'' to the noun ''Shiva'' in the Epics and the Puranas, as an auspicious deity who is the "creator, reproducer and dissolver".&lt;ref name="mmwshiva" /&gt;{{Sfn|Chakravarti|1986|pp=1, 7, 21–23}}

Sharma presents another etymology with the [[Sanskrit]] root ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|śarv}}-'', which means "to injure" or "to kill",&lt;ref&gt;For root ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|śarv}}-'' see: {{harvnb|Apte|1965|p=910}}.&lt;/ref&gt; interpreting the name to connote "one who can kill the forces of darkness".{{Sfn|Sharma|1996|p=306}}

The [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit]] word ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|śaiva}}'' means "relating to the god Shiva", and this term is the Sanskrit name both for one of the principal sects of Hinduism and for a member of that sect.{{sfn|Apte|1965|p=927}} It is used as an adjective to characterize certain beliefs and practices, such as Shaivism.&lt;ref&gt;For the definition "Śaivism refers to the traditions which follow the teachings of {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Śiva}} (''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|śivaśāna}}'') and which focus on the deity {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Śiva}}... " see: {{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors associate the name with the [[Tamil language|Tamil word]] ''{{IAST|śivappu}}'' meaning "red", noting that Shiva is linked to the Sun (''{{IAST|śivan}}'', "the Red one", in Tamil) and that Rudra is also called ''Babhru'' (brown, or red) in the Rigveda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=van Lysebeth|first1=Andre|title=Tantra: Cult of the Feminine|date=2002|publisher=Weiser Books|isbn=978-0877288459|page=213|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4W-DivEweIC&amp;pg=FA213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tyagi|first1=Ishvar Chandra|title=Shaivism in Ancient India: From the Earliest Times to C.A.D. 300|publisher=Meenakshi Prakashan|year=1982| page=81| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WH3XAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Vishnu sahasranama]]'' interprets ''Shiva'' to have multiple meanings: "The Pure One", and "the One who is not affected by three [[Guṇa]]s of [[Prakṛti]] ([[Sattva]], [[Rajas]], and [[Tamas (philosophy)|Tamas]])".{{sfnm|Sri Vishnu Sahasranama|1986|1pp=47, 122|Chinmayananda|2002|2p=24}}

=== Assimilation of traditions ===
{{See also|Hinduism#Roots of Hinduism|l1=Roots of Hinduism}}

The Shiva-related tradition is a major part of Hinduism, found all over the [[Indian subcontinent]], such as India, [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]],{{sfnm|Flood|1996|1p=17|Keay|2000|2p=xxvii}} and [[Southeast Asia]], such as [[Bali, Indonesia]].{{sfn|Boon|1977|pp=143, 205}} Shiva has pre-Vedic tribal roots,{{sfnm|Sadasivan|2000|1p=148|Sircar|1998|2pp=3 with footnote 2, 102–105}} having "his origins in primitive tribes, signs and symbols."{{sfn|Sadasivan|2000|p=148}} The figure of Shiva as we know him today is an amalgamation of various older deities into a single figure, due to the process of [[Sanskritization]] and the emergence of the [[Hindu synthesis]] in post-Vedic times.{{sfnm|Flood|1996|1pp=148–149|Keay|2000|2p=xxvii|Granoff|2003|3pp=95–114}} How the persona of Shiva converged as a composite deity is not well documented, a challenge to trace and has attracted much speculation.&lt;ref&gt;For Shiva as a composite deity whose history is not well documented, see {{harvnb|Keay|2000|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vijay Nath:
{{blockquote|Vishnu and Siva [...] began to absorb countless local cults and deities within their folds. The latter were either taken to represent the multiple facets of the same god or else were supposed to denote different forms and appellations by which the god came to be known and worshipped. [...] Siva became identified with countless local cults by the sheer suffixing of ''Isa'' or ''Isvara'' to the name of the local deity, e.g., Bhutesvara, Hatakesvara, Chandesvara."{{sfn|Nath|2001|p=31}}}}

An example of assimilation took place in [[Maharashtra]], where a regional deity named [[Khandoba]] is a patron deity of farming and herding [[caste]]s.{{sfn|Courtright|1985|p=205}} The foremost center of worship of Khandoba in Maharashtra is in [[Jejuri]].&lt;ref&gt;For Jejuri as the foremost center of worship see: {{harvnb|Mate|1988|p=162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Khandoba has been assimilated as a form of Shiva himself,{{sfn|Sontheimer|1976|pp=180–198|ps=: "Khandoba is a local deity in Maharashtra and been Sanskritised as an incarnation of Shiva."}} in which case he is worshipped in the form of a lingam.{{sfn|Courtright|1985|p=205}}&lt;ref&gt;For worship of Khandoba in the form of a lingam and possible identification with Shiva based on that, see: {{harvnb|Mate|1988|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Khandoba's varied associations also include an identification with [[Surya]]{{sfn|Courtright|1985|p=205}} and [[Karttikeya]].&lt;ref&gt;For use of the name Khandoba as a name for Karttikeya in Maharashtra, see: {{harvnb|Gupta|1988|loc=''Preface'', and p. 40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-Vedic elements ===

==== Pre-historic art ====
Scholars have interpreted early prehistoric paintings at the [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]], considered to be from pre-10,000 BCE period,{{sfn|Klostermaier|2007|pp=24–25|ps=: "... prehistoric cave paintings at Bhimbetka (from ca. 100,000 to ca. 10,000 BCE) which were discovered only in 1967..."}} as Shiva dancing, Shiva's trident, and his mount Nandi.{{sfnm|Javid|2008|1pp=20–21|Mathpal|1984|2p=220|3a1=Rajarajan|3y=1996}} Rock paintings from Bhimbetka, depicting a figure with a trident or [[trishula|trishul]], have been described as [[Nataraja]] by Erwin Neumayer, who dates them to the [[mesolithic]].{{sfn|Neumayer|2013|p=104}}{{efn|reference=Temporal range for Mesolithic in South Asia is from 12000 to 4000 years [[before present]]. The term "Mesolithic" is not a useful term for the periodization of the South Asian Stone Age, as certain [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|tribes]] in the interior of the Indian subcontinent retained a mesolithic culture into the modern period, and there is no consistent usage of the term. The range 12,000–4,000 Before Present is based on the combination of the ranges given by Agrawal et al. (1978) and by Sen (1999), and overlaps with the early Neolithic at [[Mehrgarh]]. D.P.

==== Indus Valley and the Pashupati seal ====
{{Main|Pashupati seal}}
[[File:Shiva Pashupati.jpg|upright|thumb|200px|The [[Pashupati seal]] discovered during excavation of the [[Indus Valley civilisation|Indus Valley]] archaeological site of [[Mohenjo-Daro]] and showing a possible representation of a "yogi" or "proto-Shiva" figure as [[Pashupati|Paśupati]] (Lord of the Animals" c. 2350–2000 BCE]]

Of several Indus valley seals that show animals, one seal that has attracted attention shows a large central figure, either horned or wearing a horned headdress and possibly [[ithyphallic]],{{refn|group=note|name="ilph_rep_l"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh|1989}}; {{harvnb|Kenoyer|1998}}. For a drawing of the seal see Figure 1 in {{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; seated in a posture reminiscent of the [[Lotus position]], surrounded by animals. This figure was named by early excavators of [[Mohenjo-daro]] as ''[[Pashupati]]'' (Lord of Animals, [[Sanskrit]] ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|paśupati}}''),&lt;ref&gt;For translation of ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|paśupati}}'' as "Lord of Animals" see: {{harvnb|Michaels|2004|p=312}}.&lt;/ref&gt; an epithet of the later [[Hindu deities]] Shiva and Rudra.{{sfnm|Vohra|2000|p=[https://archive.org/details/makingindiahisto00vohr/page/n10 15]|Bongard-Levin|1985|2p=45|3a1=Rosen|3a2=Schweig|3y=2006|3p=45}} [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|Sir John Marshall]] and others suggested that this figure is a prototype of Shiva, with three faces, seated in a "[[yoga]] posture" with the knees out and feet joined.{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=28–29}} Semi-circular shapes on the head were interpreted as two horns. Scholars such as [[Gavin Flood]], [[John Keay]] and [[Doris Meth Srinivasan]] have expressed doubts about this suggestion.{{sfnm|Flood|1996|1pp=28–29|Flood|2003|2pp=204–205|Srinivasan|1997|3p=181}}

[[Gavin Flood]] states that it is not clear from the seal that the figure has three faces, is seated in a yoga posture, or even that the shape is intended to represent a human figure. He characterizes these views as "speculative", but adds that it is nevertheless possible that there are echoes of Shaiva [[iconographic]] themes, such as half-moon shapes resembling the horns of a [[bull]].{{sfnm|Flood|1996|1pp=28–29|Flood|2003|2pp=204–205}} John Keay writes that "he may indeed be an early manifestation of Lord Shiva as Pashu-pati", but a couple of his specialties of this figure does not match with Rudra.{{sfn|Keay|2000|p=14}} Writing in 1997, Srinivasan interprets what [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]] interpreted as facial as not human but more bovine, possibly a divine buffalo-man.{{sfn|Srinivasan|1997|p=181}}

The interpretation of the seal continues to be disputed. [[McEvilley]], for example, states that it is not possible to "account for this posture outside the yogic account".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McEvilley|first=Thomas|date=1981-03-01|title=An Archaeology of Yoga| journal=Res: Anthropology and Aesthetics| volume=1| page =51| doi= 10.1086/RESv1n1ms20166655|s2cid=192221643|issn=0277-1322 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asko Parpola states that other archaeological finds such as the early Elamite seals dated to 3000–2750 BCE show similar figures and these have been interpreted as "seated bull" and not a yogi, and the bovine interpretation is likely more accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Asko Parpola(2009), Deciphering the Indus Script, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521795661}}, pp. 240–250&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory L. Possehl in 2002, associated it with the water buffalo, and concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognize the figure as a deity, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would "go too far".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XVgeAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA154|title=The Indus Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective|last=Possehl|first=Gregory L.|date=2002|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0759116429|pages=140–144|author-link=Gregory Possehl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vedic elements ===
According to Anthony, the Old Indic religion probably emerged among Indo-European immigrants in the contact zone between the [[Zeravshan River]] (present-day [[Uzbekistan]]) and (present-day) Iran.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=462}} It was "a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements",{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=462}} which according to Beckwith borrowed "distinctive religious beliefs and practices"{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} from the [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria–Margiana Culture]].{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} At least 383 non-Indo-European words were borrowed from this culture, including the god Indra and the ritual drink [[Soma (drink)|Soma]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=454–455}}

==== Rudra ====
[[File:ThreeHeadedShivaGandhara2ndCentury.jpg|upright|thumb|200px|Three-headed Shiva, Gandhara, 2nd century AD]]

Shiva as we know him today shares many features with the Vedic god [[Rudra]],{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=316}} and both Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in [[Hindu texts|Hindu scriptures]]. The two names are used synonymously. Rudra, a [[Rigvedic deity]] with fearsome powers, was the god of the roaring [[storm]]. He is usually portrayed in accordance with the element he represents as a fierce, destructive deity.{{sfn|Flood|2003|p=73}} In RV 2.33, he is described as the "Father of the [[Rudras]]", a group of storm gods.&lt;ref&gt;Doniger, pp. 221–223.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=April 2022}}

Flood notes that Rudra is an ambiguous god, peripheral in the Vedic pantheon, possibly indicating non-Vedic origins.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=152}} Nevertheless, both Rudra and Shiva are akin to [[Odin|Wodan]], the Germanic God of rage ("wütte") and the [[wild hunt]].{{sfnm|Zimmer|2000|p=186}}{{sfn|Storl|2004}}{{page needed|date=April 2022}}{{sfn|Winstedt|2020}}{{page needed|date=April 2022}}

According to Sadasivan, during the development of the [[Hindu synthesis]] attributes of the Buddha were transferred by Brahmins to Shiva, who was also linked with [[Rudra]].{{Sfn|Sadasivan|2000|p=148}} The Rigveda has 3 out of 1,028 hymns dedicated to Rudra, and he finds occasional mention in other hymns of the same text.{{Sfn|Chakravarti|1986|pp=1–2}} Hymn 10.92 of the Rigveda states that deity Rudra has two natures, one wild and cruel (Rudra), another that is kind and tranquil (Shiva).{{sfn|Kramrisch|1994a|p=7}}

The term Shiva also appears simply as an epithet, that means "kind, auspicious", one of the adjectives used to describe many different Vedic deities. While fierce ruthless natural phenomenon and storm-related Rudra is feared in the hymns of the Rigveda, the beneficial rains he brings are welcomed as Shiva aspect of him.{{Sfn|Chakravarti|1986|pp=2–3}} This healing, nurturing, life-enabling aspect emerges in the Vedas as Rudra-Shiva, and in post-Vedic literature ultimately as Shiva who combines the destructive and constructive powers, the terrific and the gentle, as the ultimate recycler and rejuvenator of all existence.{{Sfn|Chakravarti|1986|pp=1–9}}

The Vedic texts do not mention bull or any animal as the transport vehicle (''vahana'') of Rudra or other deities. However, post-Vedic texts such as the Mahabharata and the Puranas state the Nandi bull, the Indian [[zebu]], in particular, as the vehicle of Rudra and of Shiva, thereby unmistakably linking them as same.{{sfn|Kramrisch|1994a|pp=14–15}}

==== Agni ====
[[Rudra]] and [[Agni]] have a close relationship.{{refn|group=note|For a general statement of the close relationship, and example shared epithets, see: {{harvnb|Sivaramamurti|1976|p=11}}. For an overview of the Rudra-Fire complex of ideas, see: {{harvnb|Kramrisch|1981|pp=15–19}}.}} The identification between Agni and Rudra in the Vedic literature was an important factor in the process of Rudra's gradual transformation into Rudra-Shiva.{{refn|group=note|For quotation "An important factor in the process of Rudra's growth is his identification with Agni in the Vedic literature and this identification contributed much to the transformation of his character as {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Rudra-Śiva}}." see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|p=17}}.}} The identification of [[Agni]] with Rudra is explicitly noted in the ''[[Nirukta]]'', an important early text on etymology, which says, "Agni is also called Rudra."&lt;ref&gt;For translation from ''Nirukta'' 10.7, see: {{harvnb|Sarup|1998|p=155}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The interconnections between the two deities are complex, and according to Stella Kramrisch:
{{blockquote|The fire myth of {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Rudra-Śiva}} plays on the whole gamut of fire, valuing all its potentialities and phases, from conflagration to illumination.{{sfn|Kramrisch|1994a|p=18}}}}

In the [[Shri Rudram Chamakam|''Śatarudrīya'']], some epithets of Rudra, such as {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Sasipañjara}} ("Of golden red hue as of flame") and {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Tivaṣīmati}} ("Flaming bright"), suggest a fusing of the two deities.{{refn|group=note|For "Note Agni-Rudra concept fused" in epithets {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Sasipañjara}} and {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Tivaṣīmati}} see: {{harvnb|Sivaramamurti|1976|p=45}}.}} Agni is said to be a bull,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv06048.htm |title=Rig Veda: Rig-Veda, Book 6: HYMN XLVIII. Agni and Others |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |access-date=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lord Shiva possesses a bull as his vehicle, [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]]. The horns of [[Agni]], who is sometimes characterized as a bull, are mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;For the parallel between the horns of Agni as bull, and Rudra, see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|p=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RV 8.49; 10.155.&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval sculpture, both [[Agni]] and the form of Shiva known as [[Bhairava]] have flaming hair as a special feature.&lt;ref&gt;For flaming hair of Agni and Bhairava see: Sivaramamurti, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indra ====
According to [[Wendy Doniger]], the Saivite fertility myths and some of the phallic characteristics of Shiva are inherited from [[Indra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Doniger|first=Wendy|author-link=Wendy Doniger|title=Śiva, the erotic ascetic|year=1973|publisher=Oxford University Press US|pages=84–89|chapter = The Vedic Antecedents }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doniger gives several reasons for her hypothesis. Both are associated with mountains, rivers, male fertility, fierceness, fearlessness, warfare, the transgression of established mores, the [[Om|Aum]] sound, the Supreme Self. In the Rig Veda the term ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|śiva}}'' is used to refer to Indra. (2.20.3,{{refn|group=note|For text of RV 2.20.3a as {{lang|sa|स नो युवेन्द्रो जोहूत्रः सखा शिवो नरामस्तु पाता ।}} and translation as "May that young adorable ''Indra'', ever be the friend, the benefactor, and protector of us, his worshipper".{{Sfn|Arya|Joshi |2001|p=48, volume 2}}}} 6.45.17,&lt;ref&gt;For text of RV 6.45.17 as {{lang|sa|यो गृणतामिदासिथापिरूती शिवः सखा । स त्वं न इन्द्र मृलय ॥ }} and translation as "''Indra'', who has ever been the friend of those who praise you, and the insurer of their happiness by your protection, grant us felicity" see: {{harvnb|Arya|Joshi|2001|p=91}}, volume 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For translation of RV 6.45.17 as "Thou who hast been the singers' Friend, a Friend auspicious with thine aid, As such, O Indra, favour us" see: {{Harvnb|Griffith|1973|p=310}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and 8.93.3.&lt;ref&gt;For text of RV 8.93.3 as {{lang|sa|स न इन्द्रः सिवः सखाश्चावद् गोमद्यवमत् । उरूधारेव दोहते ॥}} and translation as "May ''Indra'', our auspicious friend, milk for us, like a richly-streaming (cow), wealth of horses, kine, and barley" see: {{harvnb|Arya|Joshi|2001|p=48}}, volume 2.&lt;/ref&gt;) Indra, like Shiva, is likened to a bull.&lt;ref&gt;For the bull parallel between Indra and Rudra see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|p=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RV 7.19.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Rig Veda, Rudra is the father of the [[Maruts]], but he is never associated with their warlike exploits as is Indra.&lt;ref&gt;For the lack of warlike connections and difference between Indra and Rudra, see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indra himself may have been adopted by the Vedic Aryans from the [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria–Margiana Culture]].{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=454–455}} According to Anthony,
{{blockquote|Many of the qualities of Indo-Iranian god of might/victory, [[Verethraghna]], were transferred to the adopted god Indra, who became the central deity of the developing Old Indic culture. Indra was the subject of 250 hymns, a quarter of the ''Rig Veda''. He was associated more than any other deity with ''Soma'', a stimulant drug (perhaps derived from ''Ephedra'') probably borrowed from the BMAC religion. His rise to prominence was a peculiar trait of the Old Indic speakers.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=454}}}}

The texts and artwork of [[Jainism]] show Indra as a dancer, although not identical generally resembling the dancing Shiva artwork found in Hinduism, particularly in their respective mudras.{{sfn|Owen|2012|pp=25–29}} For example, in the Jain caves at [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]], extensive carvings show dancing Indra next to the images of [[Tirthankara]]s in a manner similar to Shiva Nataraja. The similarities in the dance iconography suggests that there may be a link between ancient Indra and Shiva.{{sfnm|Sivaramamurti|2004|1pp=41, 59|Owen|2012|2pp=25–29}}

=== Development ===
A few texts such as ''[[Atharvashiras Upanishad]]'' mention [[Rudra]], and assert all gods are Rudra, everyone and everything is Rudra, and Rudra is the principle found in all things, their highest goal, the innermost essence of all reality that is visible or invisible.{{Sfn|Deussen|1997|p=769}} The ''[[Kaivalya Upanishad]]'' similarly, states [[Paul Deussen]] – a German Indologist and professor of philosophy, describes the self-realized man as who "feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all", who feels identity of his and everyone's consciousness with Shiva (highest Atman), who has found this highest Atman within, in the depths of his heart.{{sfnm|Deussen|1997|1pp=792–793|Radhakrishnan|1953|2p=929}}

Rudra's evolution from a minor Vedic deity to a supreme being is first evidenced in the ''[[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]]'' (400–200 BCE), according to Gavin Flood, presenting the earliest seeds of theistic devotion to Rudra-Shiva.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=204–205}} Here Rudra-Shiva is identified as the creator of the cosmos and [[Saṃsāra|liberator of Selfs]] from the birth-rebirth cycle. The Svetasvatara Upanishad set the tone for early Shaivite thought, especially in chapter 3 verse 2 where Shiva is equated with Brahman: "Rudra is truly one; for the knowers of Brahman do not admit the existence of a second".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.esamskriti.com/e/Spirituality/Upanishads-Commentary/Svetasvatara-Upanishad-~-Chap-3-The-Highest-Reality-1.aspx | title=Svetasvatara Upanishad - Chap 3 the Highest Reality }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/edit-page/speaking-tree-the-trika-tradition-of-kashmir-shaivism/articleshow/4822600.cms | title=Speaking Tree: The Trika Tradition of Kashmir Shaivism | website=[[The Times of India]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The period of 200 BC to 100 AD also marks the beginning of the Shaiva tradition focused on the worship of Shiva as evidenced in other literature of this period.{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=204–205}} Other scholars such as Robert Hume and Doris Srinivasan state that the ''Shvetashvatara Upanishad'' presents pluralism, [[pantheism]], or [[henotheism]], rather than being a text just on Shiva theism.{{sfnm|Hume|1921|1pp=399, 403|Hiriyanna|2000|2pp=32–36|3a1=Kunst|3y=1968|Srinivasan|1997|4loc=pp. 96–97 and Chapter 9}}

The earliest iconic artworks of Shiva may be from Gandhara and northwest parts of ancient India. There is some uncertainty as the artwork that has survived is damaged and they show some overlap with meditative Buddha-related artwork, but the presence of Shiva's trident and phallic symbolism{{refn|group=note|name="ilph_rep_l"}} in this art suggests it was likely Shiva.{{sfn|Blurton|1993|pp=84, 103}} [[Numismatics]] research suggests that numerous coins of the ancient [[Kushan Empire]] (30–375 CE) that have survived, were images of a god who is probably Shiva.{{sfn|Blurton|1993|p=84}} The Shiva in Kushan coins is referred to as Oesho of unclear etymology and origins, but the simultaneous presence of Indra and Shiva in the Kushan era artwork suggest that they were revered deities by the start of the Kushan Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pratapaditya Pal|title=Indian Sculpture: Circa 500 B.C.–A.D. 700|url=https://archive.org/details/indiansculpturec00losa |url-access=registration|year=1986|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520-059917|pages=[https://archive.org/details/indiansculpturec00losa/page/75 75]–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sivaramamurti|2004|pp=41, 59}}

The [[Shaiva Upanishads]] are a group of 14 minor Upanishads of Hinduism variously dated from the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE through the 17th century.{{Sfn|Deussen| 1997|p=556, 769 footnote 1}} These extol Shiva as the metaphysical unchanging reality [[Brahman]] and the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (Self),{{Sfn|Deussen|1997|p=769}} and include sections about rites and symbolisms related to Shiva.{{Sfn|Klostermaier|1984|pp=134, 371}}

The [[Puranas#Classification|Shaiva Puranas]], particularly the [[Shiva Purana]] and the [[Linga Purana]], present the various aspects of Shiva, mythologies, cosmology and pilgrimage (''[[Tirtha (Hinduism)|Tirtha]]'') associated with him.{{sfnm|Flood|2003|1pp=205–206|Rocher|1986|2pp=187–188, 222–228}} The Shiva-related [[Tantra]] literature, composed between the 8th and 11th centuries, are regarded in devotional dualistic Shaivism as [[Sruti]]. Dualistic [[Āgama (Hinduism)#Philosophy|Shaiva Agamas]] which consider Self within each living being and Shiva as two separate realities (dualism, ''dvaita''), are the foundational texts for [[Shaiva Siddhanta]].{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=208–212}} Other Shaiva Agamas teach that these are one reality (monism, ''advaita''), and that Shiva is the Self, the perfection and truth within each living being.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1990|pp=9–14}}; {{harvnb|Davis|1992|loc=p. 167 note 21}}, ''Quote (page 13):'' "Some agamas argue a monist metaphysics, while others are decidedly dualist. Some claim ritual is the most efficacious means of religious attainment, while others assert that knowledge is more important".&lt;/ref&gt; In Shiva related sub-traditions, there are ten dualistic Agama texts, eighteen qualified monism-cum-dualism Agama texts and sixty-four monism Agama texts.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Dyczkowski (1989), The Canon of the Śaivāgama, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805958}}, pl. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JS Vasugupta (2012), Śiva Sūtras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120804074}}, pp. 252, 259&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Flood|1996|pp=162–169}}

Shiva-related literature developed extensively across India in the 1st millennium CE and through the 13th century, particularly in Kashmir and Tamil Shaiva traditions.{{Sfn|Flood|1996|pp=162–169}} Shaivism gained immense popularity in [[Tamilakam]] as early as the 7th century CE, with poets such as [[Appar]] and [[Sambandar]] composing rich poetry that is replete with present features associated with the deity, such as his [[tandava]] dance, the mulavam (dumru), the aspect of holding fire, and restraining the proud flow of the Ganga upon his braid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Somasundaram |first1=Ottilingam |last2=Murthy |first2=Tejus |date=2017 |title=Siva - The Mad Lord: A Puranic perspective |journal=Indian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=119–122 |doi=10.4103/0019-5545.204441 |issn=0019-5545 |pmc=5418997 |pmid=28529371}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monist Shiva literature posit absolute oneness, that is Shiva is within every man and woman, Shiva is within every living being, Shiva is present everywhere in the world including all non-living being, and there is no spiritual difference between life, matter, man and Shiva.{{sfn|Tagare|2002|pp=16–19}} The various dualistic and monist Shiva-related ideas were welcomed in medieval southeast Asia, inspiring numerous Shiva-related temples, artwork and texts in Indonesia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, with syncretic integration of local pre-existing theologies.{{sfnm|Flood|2003|1pp=208–212|Gonda|1975|2pp=3–20, 35–36, 49–51|Thakur|1986|3pp=83–94}}

== Position within Hinduism ==
[[File:Lingothbhavar.jpg|thumb|[[Lingodbhava]] is a Shaiva sectarian icon where Shiva is depicted rising from the [[Lingam]] (an infinite fiery pillar) that narrates how Shiva is the foremost of the [[Trimurt]]i; [[Brahma]] on the left and [[Vishnu]] on the right are depicted bowing to Shiva in the centre.]]

=== Shaivism ===
{{Main|Shaivism}}
Shaivism is one of the four major sects of [[Hinduism]], the others being [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaktism]] and the [[Smarta Tradition]]. Followers of Shaivism, called "Shaivas", revere Shiva as the Supreme Being. Shaivas believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is.{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|p=65}}{{Sfn|Issitt|Main|2014|pp=147, 168}} He is not only the creator in Shaivism, but he is also the creation that results from him, he is everything and everywhere. Shiva is the primal Self, the pure consciousness and [[Brahman|Absolute Reality]] in the Shaiva traditions.{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|p=65}}

The Shaivism theology is broadly grouped into two: the popular theology influenced by Shiva-Rudra in the Vedas, Epics and the Puranas; and the esoteric theology influenced by the Shiva and Shakti-related Tantra texts.{{Sfn|Michaels|2004|p=216}} The Vedic-Brahmanic Shiva theology includes both monist (''Advaita'') and devotional traditions (''Dvaita'') such as Tamil [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] and [[Lingayatism]] with temples featuring items such as linga, Shiva-Parvati iconography, bull Nandi within the premises, relief artwork showing aspects of Shiva.{{Sfn|Michaels|2004|pp=216–218}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|title=A History of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aohGsuUuXuMC |year=1973|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-81208-04166|pages=17, 48–49, 65–67, 155–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tantra|Tantric]] Shiva tradition ignored the mythologies and Puranas related to Shiva, and depending on the sub-school developed a variety of practices. For example, historical records suggest the tantric [[Kapalika]]s (literally, the 'skull-men') co-existed with and shared many Vajrayana Buddhist rituals, engaged in esoteric practices that revered Shiva and Shakti wearing skulls, begged with empty skulls, and sometimes used meat as a part of ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David N.

=== Vaishnavism ===
The Vaishnava (Vishnu-oriented) literature acknowledges and discusses Shiva. Like Shaiva literature that presents Shiva as supreme, the Vaishnava literature presents [[Vishnu]] as supreme. However, both traditions are pluralistic and revere both Shiva and Vishnu (along with Devi), their texts do not show exclusivism, and Vaishnava texts such as the ''Bhagavata Purana'' while praising [[Krishna]] as the Ultimate Reality, also present Shiva and Shakti as a personalized form an equivalent to the same Ultimate Reality.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bryant (2003), Krishna: The Beautiful Legend of God: Srimad Bhagavata Purana, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0141913377}}, pp. 10–12, Quote: "(...) accept and indeed extol the transcendent and absolute nature of the other, and of the Goddess Devi too"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludo Rocher (1986), The Puranas, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447025225}}, p. 23 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EO James (1997), The Tree of Life, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004016125}}, pp. 150–153&lt;/ref&gt; The texts of Shaivism tradition similarly praise Vishnu. The Skanda Purana, for example, states:

{{Blockquote|
Vishnu is no one but Shiva, and he who is called Shiva is but identical with Vishnu.
|Skanda Purana |1.8.20–21&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Maehle (2009), Ashtanga Yoga, New World, {{ISBN|978-1577316695}}, p. 17; for Sanskrit, see: [https://archive.org/stream/SriSkandaPuranam-SankaraSamhitaPart1#page/n31/mode/2up Skanda Purana] Shankara Samhita Part 1, Verses 1.8.20–21 (Sanskrit)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Both traditions include legends about who is superior, about Shiva paying homage to Vishnu, and Vishnu paying homage to Shiva. However, in texts and artwork of either tradition, the mutual salutes are symbolism for complementarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Saroj Panthey|title=Iconography of Śiva in Pahāṛī Paintings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GUBXNueBQo0C|year=1987|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-8170990161|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahabharata declares the unchanging Ultimate Reality (Brahman) to be identical to Shiva and to Vishnu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Holdrege|editor=Hananya Goodman|title=Between Jerusalem and Benares: Comparative Studies in Judaism and Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XF_a3cfrcLQC&amp;pg=PA122|year=2012|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1438404370|pages=120–125 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Vishnu is the highest manifestation of Shiva, and Shiva is the highest manifestation of Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Johnston|title=The Atlantic Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SGACAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA835|volume=CXII|year=1913|publisher=Riverside Press, Cambridge|pages=835–836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shaktism ===

The goddess-oriented Shakti tradition of Hinduism is based on the premise that the Supreme Principle and the Ultimate Reality called Brahman is female ([[Devi]]),{{Sfn|Coburn|2002|pp=1, 53–56, 280}}{{Sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=426}}{{Sfn|Kinsley|1988|pp=101–105}} but it treats the male as her equal and complementary partner.{{sfnm|Kinsley|1988|1pp=50, 103–104|Pintchman|2015|2pp=113, 119, 144, 171}} This partner is Shiva.{{sfn|Pintchman|2014|pp=85–86, 119, 144, 171}}{{Sfn|Coburn|1991|pp=19–24, 40, 65, Narayani p. 232}}

The earliest evidence of the tradition of reverence for the feminine with Rudra-Shiva context, is found in the Hindu scripture ''[[Rigveda]]'', in a hymn called the Devi Sukta.{{Sfn| McDaniel |2004|p=90}}{{Sfn| Brown |1998|p=26}}{{Sfn| McDaniel |2004|p=90}}{{Sfn| Brown |1998|p=26}}&lt;ref name="Hymn 125"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1LTRDwAAQBAJ|title = The Rigveda|isbn = 978-0190633394|last1 = Jamison|first1 = Stephanie|last2 = Brereton|first2 = Joel|date = 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Devi Upanishad]]'' in its explanation of the theology of Shaktism, mentions and praises Shiva such as in its verse 19.{{Sfn|Brown|1998|p=77}}{{Sfn|Warrier|1967|pp=77–84}} Shiva, along with Vishnu, is a revered god in the ''[[Devi Mahatmya]]'', a text of Shaktism considered by the tradition to be as important as the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|p=193}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David R.

Philosophically, the Smarta tradition emphasizes that all idols ([[murti]]) are icons to help focus on and visualize aspects of Brahman, rather than distinct beings.

=== Yoga ===

Shiva is considered the Great Yogi who is totally absorbed in himself – the transcendental reality. He is the Lord of [[Yogi]]s, and the teacher of [[Yoga]] to sages.{{sfn|Kramrisch|1981|p=[https://archive.org/details/manifestationsof00kram/page/22 22]}} As Shiva Dakshinamurthi, states Stella Kramrisch, he is the supreme [[guru]] who "teaches in silence the oneness of one's innermost self (''atman'') with the ultimate reality (''brahman'')."{{sfn|Kramrisch|1981|p=[https://archive.org/details/manifestationsof00kram/page/23 23] }} Shiva is also an archetype for ''samhara'' ({{lang-sa|संहार}}) or ''dissolution'' which includes transcendence of human misery by the dissolution of ''[[Maya (religion)|maya]]'', which is why Shiva is associated with [[Yoga]].&lt;ref name="inv07"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Krishnan|last1=Ramaswamy|first2=Antonio|last2=de Nicolas|first3=Aditi|last3=Banerjee|title=Invading the Sacred|page=59|isbn=978-8129111821|publisher=Rupa Publication|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/samhara|title=Samhara, Saṃhāra: 18 definitions|date=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory and practice of Yoga, in different styles, has been a part of all major traditions of Hinduism, and Shiva has been the patron or spokesperson in numerous Hindu Yoga texts.&lt;ref name=shivayoga1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=shivayoga2 /&gt; These contain the philosophy and techniques for Yoga. These ideas are estimated to be from or after the late centuries of the 1st millennium CE, and have survived as Yoga texts such as the ''Isvara Gita'' (literally, 'Shiva's song'), which [[Andrew J. Nicholson|Andrew Nicholson]] – a professor of Hinduism and Indian Intellectual History – states have had "a profound and lasting influence on the development of Hinduism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew J.

Other famed Shiva-related texts influenced [[Hatha Yoga]], integrated monistic (''Advaita Vedanta'') ideas with Yoga philosophy and inspired the theoretical development of [[Indian classical dance]]. These include the ''Shiva Sutras'', the ''Shiva Samhita'', and those by the scholars of Kashmir Shaivism such as the 10th-century scholar [[Abhinavagupta]].&lt;ref name=shivayoga1&gt;[a] {{cite book|author1=Vasugupta|author2=Jaideva|title=Śiva Sūtras|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j4SOIISR9PUC|year=1979|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-8120804074|pages=xv–xx}};&lt;br /&gt;[b] {{cite book|author=James Mallinson|title=The Shiva Samhita: A Critical Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlQRnDOr178C|year=2007|publisher=Yoga|oclc= 76143968 |isbn=978-0971646650|pages=xiii–xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shivayoga2&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Jaideva Vasugupta|title=The Yoga of Delight, Wonder, and Astonishment: A Translation of the Vijnana-bhairava with an Introduction and Notes by Jaideva Singh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVc5JCnO1VgC|year=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0791410738|pages=xii–xvi}};&lt;br /&gt;[b] {{cite book|author1=Vasugupta|author2=Jaideva|title=The Yoga of Vibration and Divine Pulsation: A Translation of the Spanda Karika with Ksemaraja's Commentary, the Spanda Nirnaya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQwtCrGERjkC |year=1980|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0791411797|pages=xxv–xxxii, 2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Smith|title=The Dance of Siva: Religion, Art and Poetry in South India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fTLlcGlkdjkC&amp;pg=PA237 |year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521528658|pages=237–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abhinavagupta writes in his notes on the relevance of ideas related to Shiva and Yoga, by stating that "people, occupied as they are with their own affairs, normally do nothing for others", and Shiva and Yoga spirituality helps one look beyond, understand interconnectedness, and thus benefit both the individual and the world towards a more blissful state of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jaideva Vasugupta|author2=Mark S.

=== Trimurti ===
{{Main|Trimurti}}
The Trimurti is a concept in Hinduism in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified by the forms of [[Brahma]] the creator, Vishnu the maintainer or preserver and Shiva the destroyer or transformer.&lt;ref&gt;For quotation defining the Trimurti see Matchett, Freda. "The {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Purāṇas}}", in: {{harvnb|Flood|2003|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ralph Metzner|title=Opening to Inner Light: The Transformation of Human Nature and Consciousness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ke0RAQAAIAAJ|year=1986|publisher=J.P.

See: {{harvnb|Gonda|1969|pp=218–219}}; Other trinities, beyond the more common "Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva", mentioned in ancient and medieval Hindu texts include: "Indra, Vishnu, Brahmanaspati", "Agni, Indra, Surya", "Agni, Vayu, Aditya", "Mahalakshmi, Mahasarasvati, and Mahakali", and others.

== Attributes ==
[[File:6 Śiva and Pārvatī seated on a terrace. 1800 (circa) BM.jpg|thumb|Shiva with Parvati. Shiva is depicted three-eyed, the [[Ganges]] flowing through his matted hair, wearing ornaments of serpents and a skull garland, covered in ashes, and seated on a tiger skin.]]
[[File:Indian - Festival Image of Shiva - Walters 543084.jpg|thumb|A seated Shiva holds an axe and deer in his hands.]]
* '''Third eye''': Shiva is often depicted with a [[third eye]], with which he burned Desire ({{transliteration|sa|ISO|[[Kamadeva|Kāma]]}}) to ashes,&lt;ref&gt;For Shiva as depicted with a third eye, and mention of the story of the destruction of Kama with it, see: {{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; called "Tryambakam" (Sanskrit: ''त्र्यम्बकम् ''), which occurs in many scriptural sources.&lt;ref&gt;For a review of 4 theories about the meaning of ''tryambaka'', see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|pp=37–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In classical Sanskrit, the word ''ambaka'' denotes "an eye", and in the ''Mahabharata'', Shiva is depicted as three-eyed, so this name is sometimes translated as "having three eyes".&lt;ref&gt;For usage of the word ''ambaka'' in classical Sanskrit and connection to the Mahabharata depiction, see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|pp=38–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Vedic Sanskrit, the word ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|ambā}}'' or ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|ambikā}}'' means "mother", and this early meaning of the word is the basis for the translation "three mothers".&lt;ref&gt;For translation of Tryambakam as "having three mother eyes" and as an epithet of Rudra, see: {{harvnb|Kramrisch|1981|p=483}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Vedic Sanskrit meaning Lord has three mother eyes which symbolize eyes are the Sun, Moon and Fire.&lt;/ref&gt; These three mother-goddesses who are collectively called the {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Ambikās}}.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the problems in translation of this name, and the hypothesis regarding the {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Ambikās}} see: Hopkins (1968), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Other related translations have been based on the idea that the name actually refers to the oblations given to Rudra, which according to some traditions were shared with the goddess {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Ambikā}}.&lt;ref&gt;For the {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Ambikā}} variant, see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|pp=17, 37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Crescent moon''': Shiva bears on his head the crescent moon.&lt;ref&gt;For the moon on the forehead see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Candraśekhara}} (Sanskrit: {{lang|sa|चन्द्रशेखर}} "Having the moon as his crest" – ''[[chandra|{{transliteration|sa|ISO|candra}}]]'' = "moon"; ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|śekhara}}'' = "crest, crown")&lt;ref&gt;For ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|śekhara}}'' as crest or crown, see: {{harvnb|Apte|1965|p=926}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Candraśekhara}} as an iconographic form, see: {{harvnb|Sivaramamurti|1976|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For translation "Having the moon as his crest" see: {{harvnb|Kramrisch|1981|p=472}}.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to this feature. The placement of the moon on his head as a standard iconographic feature dates to the period when Rudra rose to prominence and became the major deity Rudra-Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;For the moon iconography as marking the rise of Rudra-Shiva, see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|p=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this linkage may be due to the identification of the moon with Soma, and there is a hymn in the Rig Veda where Soma and Rudra are jointly implored, and in later literature, Soma and Rudra came to be identified with one another, as were Soma and the moon.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the linkages between Soma, Moon, and Rudra, and citation to RV 7.74, see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|pp=57–58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ashes''': Shiva iconography shows his body covered with ashes (bhasma, [[vibhuti]]).{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=151}}&lt;ref&gt;This smearing of cremation ashes emerged into a practice of some Tantra-oriented ascetics, where they would also offer meat, alcohol and sexual fluids to Bhairava (a form of Shiva), and these groups were probably not of [[Brahmanism|Brahmanic]] origin. These ascetics are mentioned in the ancient Pali Canon of Thervada Buddhism. See: {{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=92, 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ashes represent a reminder that all of material existence is impermanent, comes to an end becoming ash, and the pursuit of eternal Self and spiritual liberation is important.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Rigopoulos (2013), Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 5, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004178960}}, pp. 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title=Sechzig Upaniṣad's des Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYepeIGUY0gC |year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-8120814677|pages=775–776, 789–790, 551}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Matted hair''': Shiva's distinctive hair style is noted in the epithets {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Jaṭin}}, "the one with matted hair",{{sfn|Chidbhavananda|1997|p=22}} and Kapardin, "endowed with matted hair"&lt;ref&gt;For translation of Kapardin as "Endowed with matted hair" see: {{Harvnb|Sharma|1996|p=279}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or "wearing his hair wound in a braid in a shell-like (kaparda) fashion".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kramrisch|1981|p=475}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A kaparda is a cowrie shell, or a braid of hair in the form of a shell, or, more generally, hair that is shaggy or curly.&lt;ref&gt;For Kapardin as a name of Shiva, and description of the kaparda hair style, see, Macdonell, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Blue throat''': The epithet {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Nīlakaṇtha}} (Sanskrit {{lang|sa|नीलकण्ठ}}; ''nīla'' = "blue", ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|kaṇtha}}'' = "throat").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sharma|1996|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See: name #93 in {{harvnb|Chidbhavananda|1997|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Shiva drank the [[Halahala]] poison churned up from the [[Samudra manthan|Samudra Manthana]] to eliminate its destructive capacity. Shocked by his act, Parvati squeezed his neck and stopped it in his neck to prevent it from spreading all over the universe, supposed to be in Shiva's stomach. However the poison was so potent that it changed the color of his neck to blue.&lt;ref&gt;For Shiva drinking the poison churned from the world ocean see: {{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kramrisch|1981|p=473}} This attribute indicates that one can become Shiva by swallowing the worldly poisons in terms of abuses and insults with equanimity while blessing those who give them.&lt;ref name="Neelkanth"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dadabhagwan.org/about/trimandir/lord-shiva/|title=Lord Shiva &amp;#124; Shiv &amp;#124; God Shiva &amp;#124; Shiva God &amp;#124; Mahadev &amp;#124; Lord Shiv &amp;#124; Neelkanth|website=www.dadabhagwan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Meditating yogi''': his iconography often shows him in a [[Yoga]] pose, meditating, sometimes on a symbolic Himalayan Mount Kailasha as the Lord of Yoga.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=151}}
* '''Sacred Ganga''': The epithet ''Gangadhara'', "Bearer of the river [[Ganga]]" (Ganges). The Ganga flows from the matted hair of Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;For alternate stories about this feature, and use of the name {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Gaṅgādhara}} see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|pp=59 and 109}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For description of the {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Gaṅgādhara}} form, see: {{harvnb|Sivaramamurti|1976|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|Gaṅgā}}'' (Ganga), one of the major rivers of the country, is said to have made her abode in Shiva's hair.&lt;ref&gt;For Shiva supporting {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Gaṅgā}} upon his head, see: {{harvnb|Kramrisch|1981|p=473}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tiger skin''': Shiva is often shown seated upon a tiger skin.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=151}}
* '''Serpents''': Shiva is often shown garlanded with a [[Nāga|snake]].{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=151}}
* '''Trident''': Shiva typically carries a [[trident]] called ''[[Trishula]]''.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=151}} The trident is a weapon or a symbol in different Hindu texts.{{sfn | Wayman | Singh | 1991 | p=266}} As a symbol, the ''Trishul'' represents Shiva's three aspects of "creator, preserver and destroyer",{{sfn|Suresh Chandra|1998|p=309}} or alternatively it represents the equilibrium of three [[Gunas]] of "sattva, rajas and tamas".{{sfn|Sitansu S. Chakravarti|1991|p=51}}
* '''Drum''': A small drum shaped like an hourglass is known as a ''[[damaru]]''.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=218}}&lt;ref&gt;For definition and shape, see: {{harvnb|Apte|1965|p=461}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the attributes of Shiva in his famous dancing representation{{sfn|Jansen|1993|p=44}} known as [[Nataraja]]. A specific hand gesture ([[mudra]]) called ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|ḍamaru-hasta}}'' (Sanskrit for "{{transliteration|sa|ISO|ḍamaru}}-hand") is used to hold the drum.{{sfn|Jansen|1993|p=25}} This drum is particularly used as an emblem by members of the {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Kāpālika}} sect.&lt;ref&gt;For use by {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Kāpālikas}}, see: {{harvnb|Apte|1965|p=461}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Axe''' (''[[Parashu]]'') and '''Deer''' are held in Shiva's hands in Odisha &amp; south Indian icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=South Indian Bronzes|last=C. Sivaramamurti|publisher=Lalit Kalā Akademi|year=1963|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Rosary beads''': he is garlanded with or carries a string of rosary beads in his right hand, typically made of ''[[Rudraksha]]''.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=151}} This symbolises grace, mendicant life and meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A. Grimes|title=A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcoUFYOX0bEC&amp;pg=PA257 |year=1996|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0791430675|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Prabhavati C.

* '''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|Nandī}}:''' [[Nandi (bull)|Nandī]], (Sanskrit: [[wikt:नन्दिन्|नन्दिन्]] (nandin)), is the name of the [[Bull (mythology)|bull]] that serves as Shiva's mount.&lt;ref&gt;For a review of issues related to the evolution of the bull (Nandin) as Shiva's mount, see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|pp=99–105}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For spelling of alternate proper names {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Nandī}} and Nandin see: {{harvnb|Stutley|1985|p=98}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shiva's association with cattle is reflected in his name {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Paśupati}}, or [[Pashupati]] (Sanskrit: पशुपति), translated by Sharma as "lord of cattle"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sharma|1996|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Kramrisch as "lord of animals", who notes that it is particularly used as an epithet of Rudra.{{sfn|Kramrisch|1981|p=479}}
* '''Mount {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Kailāsa}}:''' [[Mount Kailash]] in the [[Himalayas]] is his traditional abode.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=151}}&lt;ref&gt;For the name ''Kailāsagirivāsī'' (''Sanskrit'' कैलासिगिरवासी), "With his abode on Mount Kailāsa", as a name appearing in the ''Shiva Sahasranama'', see: {{Harvnb|Sharma|1996|p=281}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Hindu mythology, Mount {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Kailāsa}} is conceived as resembling a ''[[Linga]]'', representing the center of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;For identification of Mount {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Kailāsa}} as the central ''linga'', see: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Stutley|1985}}, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|Gaṇa}}:''' The [[Gana|{{transliteration|sa|ISO|Gaṇa}}s]] are attendants of Shiva and live in Kailash. They are often referred to as the bhutaganas, or ghostly hosts, on account of their nature. Generally benign, except when their lord is transgressed against, they are often invoked to intercede with the lord on behalf of the devotee. His son [[Ganesha]] was chosen as their leader by Shiva, hence Ganesha's title ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|gaṇa-īśa}}'' or ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|gaṇa-pati}}'', "lord of the {{transliteration|sa|ISO|gaṇas}}".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend]] ({{ISBN|0500510881}}) by Anna L. Dallapiccola&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Varanasi:''' [[Varanasi]] (Benares) is considered to be the city specially loved by Shiva, and is one of the holiest places of pilgrimage in India. It is referred to, in religious contexts, as Kashi.{{sfn|Keay|2000|p=33}}

== Forms and depictions ==
According to [[Gavin Flood]], "Shiva is a god of ambiguity and paradox," whose attributes include opposing themes.&lt;ref&gt;For quotation "Shiva is a god of ambiguity and paradox" and overview of conflicting attributes see: {{harvnb|Flood|1996|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ambivalent nature of this deity is apparent in some of his names and the stories told about him.

In [[Yajurveda]], two contrary sets of attributes for both malignant or terrifying (Sanskrit: ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|rudra}}'') and benign or auspicious (Sanskrit: ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|śiva}}'') forms can be found, leading Chakravarti to conclude that "all the basic elements which created the complex Rudra-Śiva sect of later ages are to be found here".&lt;ref&gt;For quotation regarding Yajur Veda as containing contrary sets of attributes, and marking point for emergence of all basic elements of later sect forms, see: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Chakravarti|1986}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mahabharata, Shiva is depicted as "the standard of invincibility, might, and terror", as well as a figure of honor, delight, and brilliance.&lt;ref&gt;For summary of Shiva's contrasting depictions in the Mahabharata, see: {{Harvnb|Sharma|1988|pp=20–21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The duality of Shiva's fearful and auspicious attributes appears in contrasted names. The name Rudra reflects Shiva's fearsome aspects. According to traditional etymologies, the Sanskrit name ''Rudra'' is derived from the root ''rud-'', which means "to cry, howl".&lt;ref&gt;For ''rud-'' meaning "cry, howl" as a traditional etymology see: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Kramrisch|1981|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stella Kramrisch]] notes a different etymology connected with the adjectival form ''raudra'', which means "wild, of ''rudra'' nature", and translates the name ''[[Rudra]]'' as "the wild one" or "the fierce god".&lt;ref&gt;Citation to M. Mayrhofer, ''Concise Etymological Sanskrit Dictionary'', ''s.v.'' "rudra", is provided in: {{Harvard citation no brackets|Kramrisch|1981}}, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; R. K. Sharma follows this alternate etymology and translates the name as "terrible".{{sfn|Sharma|1996|p=301}} Hara is an important name that occurs three times in the Anushasanaparvan version of the ''[[Shiva Sahasranama|Shiva sahasranama]]'', where it is translated in different ways each time it occurs, following a commentorial tradition of not repeating an interpretation. Sharma translates the three as "one who captivates", "one who consolidates", and "one who destroys".{{sfn|Sharma|1996|p=314}} Kramrisch translates it as "the ravisher".{{sfn|Kramrisch|1981|p=473}} Another of Shiva's fearsome forms is as {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Kāla}} "time" and {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Mahākāla}} "great time", which ultimately destroys all things.{{sfnm|Kramrisch|1994a|1p=476|Kramrisch|1981|2p=474}} The name {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Kāla}} appears in the ''Shiva Sahasranama'', where it is translated by Ram Karan Sharma as "(the Supreme Lord of) Time".{{sfn|Sharma|1996|p=280}} [[Bhairava]] "terrible" or "frightful"{{sfn|Apte|1965|p=727|loc=left column}} is a fierce form associated with annihilation. In contrast, the name {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Śaṇkara}}, "beneficent"{{Sfn|Sharma| 1996| p=306}} or "conferring happiness"{{sfn|Kramrisch|1981|p=481}} reflects his benign form. This name was adopted by the great [[Vedanta]] philosopher [[Adi Shankara]] (c. 788–820),{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=92}} who is also known as Shankaracharya.{{sfn|Kramrisch|1994a|p=476}} The name {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Śambhu}} (Sanskrit: {{lang|sa|शम्भु}} swam-on its own; bhu-burn/shine) "self-shining/ shining on its own", also reflects this benign aspect.{{sfn|Kramrisch|1994a|p=476}}{{sfn|Chakravarti|1986| pp= 28 (note 7), and p. 177}}

=== Ascetic and householder ===
[[File:2 image collage of Shiva as yogi and householder.jpg|thumb|Shiva is depicted both as an ascetic yogi, and as a householder with goddess [[Parvati]].|276x276px]]
Shiva is depicted as both an ascetic [[yogi]] and as a householder ([[grihasta]]), roles which have been traditionally mutually exclusive in Hindu society.&lt;ref&gt;For the contrast between ascetic and householder depictions, see: {{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; When depicted as a yogi, he may be shown sitting and meditating.&lt;ref&gt;For Shiva's representation as a yogi, see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His epithet Mahāyogi ("the great Yogi: ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|Mahā}}'' = "great", ''Yogi'' = "one who practices Yoga") refers to his association with yoga.&lt;ref&gt;For name Mahāyogi and associations with yoga, see, {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|pp=23, 32, 150}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] was conceived mainly in terms of sacrifice, it was during the [[Indian epic poetry|Epic period]] that the concepts of [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]], yoga, and asceticism became more important, and the depiction of Shiva as an ascetic sitting in philosophical isolation reflects these later concepts.&lt;ref&gt;For the ascetic yogin form as reflecting Epic period influences, see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a family man and householder, he has a wife, Parvati and two sons, Ganesha and Kartikeya. His epithet {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Umāpati}} ("The husband of {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Umā}}") refers to this idea, and Sharma notes that two other variants of this name that mean the same thing, {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Umākānta}} and {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Umādhava}}, also appear in the ''sahasranama''.&lt;ref&gt;For {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Umāpati}}, {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Umākānta}} and {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Umādhava}} as names in the Shiva Sahasranama literature, see: {{Harvnb|Sharma|1996|p=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Umā}} in epic literature is known by many names, including the benign {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Pārvatī}}.&lt;ref&gt;For {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Umā}} as the oldest name, and variants including {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Pārvatī}}, see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Pārvatī}} identified as the wife of Shiva, see: {{harvnb|Kramrisch|1981|p=479}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is identified with [[Devi]], the Divine Mother; Shakti (divine energy) as well as goddesses like [[Tripura Sundari]], [[Durga]], [[Kali]], [[Kamakshi]] and [[Minakshi]]. The consorts of Shiva are the source of his creative energy. They represent the dynamic extension of Shiva onto this universe.&lt;ref name="Search for Meaning"&gt;Search for Meaning By Antonio R.

Some regional deities are also identified as Shiva's children. As one story goes, Shiva is enticed by the beauty and charm of [[Mohini]], Vishnu's female avatar, and procreates with her.

[[File:Shiva as the Lord of Dance LACMA edit.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Chola dynasty]] statue depicting Shiva dancing as [[Nataraja]] ([[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]])]]
The depiction of Shiva as [[Nataraja]] ([[Sanskrit]] नटराज; ''Naṭarāja'') is a form (''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|mūrti}}'') of Shiva (literally, "Lord of Dance").&lt;ref&gt;For description of the nataraja form see: {{harvnb|Jansen|1993|pp=110–111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For interpretation of the ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|naṭarāja}}'' form see: {{harvnb|Zimmer|1972|pp=151–157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The names Nartaka ("dancer") and Nityanarta ("eternal dancer") appear in the Shiva Sahasranama.&lt;ref&gt;For names Nartaka (''Sanskrit'' नर्तक) and Nityanarta (Sanskrit नित्यनर्त) as names of Shiva, see: {{Harvnb|Sharma|1996|p=289}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His association with dance and also with music is prominent in the [[Puranas|Puranic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;For prominence of these associations in puranic times, see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the specific iconographic form known as Nataraja, various other types of dancing forms (Sanskrit: ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|nṛtyamūrti}}'') are found in all parts of India, with many well-defined varieties in Tamil Nadu in particular.&lt;ref&gt;For popularity of the ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|nṛtyamūrti}}'' and prevalence in South India, see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The two most common forms of the dance are the [[Tandava]], which later came to denote the powerful and masculine dance as Kala-Mahakala associated with the destruction of the world. When it requires the world or universe to be destroyed, Shiva does it by the Tandava,{{sfnm|Kramrisch|1994a|1p=439|Klostermaier|1984|2p=151|2loc=''Shiva the Dancer''}} and [[Lasya]], which is graceful and delicate and expresses emotions on a gentle level and is considered the feminine dance attributed to the goddess Parvati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Massey|first=Reginald |title=India's Kathak Dance, Past Present, Future|publisher=Abhinav Publications|page=8|chapter=India's Kathak Dance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VMoorthy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moorthy|first=Vijaya |title=Romance of the Raga|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=2001|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lasya'' is regarded as the female counterpart of ''Tandava''.&lt;ref name="VMoorthy" /&gt; The ''Tandava''-''Lasya'' dances are associated with the destruction-creation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leeming|first=David Adams |title=A Dictionary of Asian Mythology|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2001|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radha|first=Sivananda |title=Kuṇḍalinī Yoga|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|year=1992|page=304|chapter=Mantra of Muladhara Chakra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vedabase.net/sb/1/2/23/en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123213949/http://vedabase.net/sb/1/2/23/en|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 November 2010|title=Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 1 Chapter 2 Verse 23|date=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dakshinamurthy]] ([[Sanskrit]] दक्षिणामूर्ति; ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|Dakṣiṇāmūrti}})''&lt;ref&gt;For iconographic description of the {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Dakṣiṇāmūrti}} form, see: {{harvnb|Sivaramamurti|1976|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a form (''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|mūrti}}'') of Shiva (literally, "[facing] south form"). Dakshinamurthy is depicted as a figure seated upon a deer-throne surrounded by sages receiving instruction.&lt;ref&gt;For the deer-throne and the audience of sages as {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Dakṣiṇāmūrti}}, see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|p=155}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This form represents Shiva in his aspect as a teacher of yoga, music, and wisdom and giving exposition on the ''shastras''.&lt;ref&gt;For description of the form as representing teaching functions, see: {{harvnb|Kramrisch|1981|p=472}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This iconographic form for depicting Shiva in Indian art is mostly from Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;For characterization of {{transliteration|sa|ISO|Dakṣiṇāmūrti}} as a mostly south Indian form, see: {{harvnb|Chakravarti|1986|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhikshatana]] ([[Sanskrit]] भिक्षाटन; ''Bhikṣāṭana'') is a form (''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|mūrti}}'') of Shiva (literally "wandering about for alms, mendicancy" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monier-Williams |first=Monier |title=Sanskrit-English Dictionary |publisher=Universität zu Köln |year=2008 |origyear=1899 |page=756}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Bhikshatana is depicted as a nude four-armed man adorned with ornaments who holds a begging bowl in his hand and is followed by demonic attendants. The nudity and begging bowl are associated with the [[Kapalika|kapali]] tradition. This form of Shiva is associated with his penance for committing brahmicide, and with his encounters with the sages and their wives in the Deodar forest.

[[Tripurantaka]] ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] त्रिपुरांतक; ''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|Tripurāntaka}}'') is a form (''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|mūrti}}'') of Shiva (literally "ender of Tripura"{{sfn|Sivaramamurti|1976|pp=34, 49}}). Tripurantaka is depicted with four arms, the upper pair holding an axe and a deer, and the lower pair wielding a bow and arrow. This form of Shiva is associated with his destruction of the three cities ([[Tripura (mythology)|Tripura]]) of the [[Asura]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For evolution of this story from early sources to the epic period, when it was used to enhance Shiva's increasing influence, see: Chakravarti, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ardhanarishvara]] ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: अर्धनारीश्वर; ''Ardhanārīśvara'') is a form (''{{transliteration|sa|ISO|mūrti}}'') of Shiva (literally "the lord who is half woman"&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg specifically rejects the translation by Frederique Marglin (1989) as "half-man, half-woman", and instead adopts the translation by Marglin as "the lord who is half woman" as given in Marglin (1989, 216). Goldberg, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;). Adhanarishvara is depicted with one half of the body as male and the other half as female. [[Ardhanarishvara]] represents the synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how [[Shakti]], the female principle of God, is inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title=Ardhanārīśvara |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/33339/Ardhanarisvara |access-date=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kalyanasundara]]-murti (Sanskrit कल्याणसुन्दर-मूर्ति, literally "icon of beautiful marriage") is the depiction of Shiva's marriage to [[Parvati]]. The divine couple are often depicted performing the ''[[Hindu wedding#Panigrahana|panigrahana]]'' (Sanskrit "accepting the hand") ritual from traditional Hindu wedding ceremonies. [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamic]] texts like the ''Amsumadbhedagama'', the ''Uttara-kamaikagama'' and the ''Purva-Karanagama'' prescribe the iconography of the Kalyanasunadara icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rao, (1916).

[[Somaskanda]] is the depiction of Shiva, Parvati, and their son Skanda ([[Kartikeya]]), popular during the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] Dynasty in southern India.

[[Pañcānana]] ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: पञ्चानन), also called the ''pañcabrahma'', is a form of Shiva depicting him as having five faces which correspond to his five divine activities (''pañcakṛtya''): creation (''sṛṣṭi''), preservation (''sthithi''), destruction (''saṃhāra''), concealing grace (''tirobhāva''), and revealing grace (''anugraha''). Five is a sacred number for Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;For five as a sacred number, see: {{harvnb|Kramrisch|1981|p=182}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most important mantras has five syllables ({{transliteration|sa|ISO|namaḥ śivāya}}).&lt;ref&gt;It is first encountered in an almost identical form in the Rudram.

The ''Linga Purana'' states, "Shiva is signless, without color, taste, smell, that is beyond word or touch, without quality, motionless and changeless".&lt;ref name="Daniélou1991p222"/&gt; The source of the universe is the signless, and all of the universe is the manifested Linga, a union of unchanging Principles and the ever changing nature.&lt;ref name="Daniélou1991p222"/&gt; The ''Linga Purana'' and [[Ishvara Gita|Siva Gita]] texts builds on this foundation.{{Sfn|Kramrisch|1994a|pp=171–185}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Anantharaman|last=K.V|title=Siva Gita A Critical Study|url=https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/295754|chapter=Chapter X – Omnipotence of Siva Linga|hdl=10603/295754}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linga, states [[Alain Daniélou]], means sign.&lt;ref name="Daniélou1991p222"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alain Daniélou|title=The Myths and Gods of India |url=https://archive.org/details/mythsgodsofindia00dani|url-access=registration|series=Princeton Bollingen Series|year=1991|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co|isbn=978-0892813544|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mythsgodsofindia00dani/page/222 222]–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important concept in Hindu texts, wherein Linga is a manifested sign and nature of someone or something. It accompanies the concept of [[Brahman]], which as invisible signless and existent Principle, is formless or linga-less.&lt;ref name="Daniélou1991p222"/&gt;

[[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] states one of the three significations, the primary one, of ''Lingam'' as "[[Purusha|the imperishable Purusha]]", [[Brahman|the absolute reality]], where says the ''linga'' as "sign", a mark that provides the existence of [[Brahman]], thus the original meaning as "sign".{{sfn|Kramrisch|1994a|p=221}} Furthermore, it says "Shiva, the Supreme Lord, has no liūga", '''liuga''' ({{lang-sa|लिऊग}} {{IAST3|liūga}}) meaning Shiva is transcendent, beyond any characteristic and, specifically the sign of gender.{{sfn|Kramrisch|1994a|p=221}}

Apart from anthropomorphic images of Shiva, he is also represented in aniconic form of a lingam.{{sfnm|Michaels|2004|1p=216|Flood|1996|2p=29}}&lt;ref&gt;Tattwananda, pp. 49–52.&lt;/ref&gt; These are depicted in various designs.

The worship of the lingam originated from the famous hymn in the ''Atharva-Veda Samhitâ'' sung in praise of the ''Yupa-Stambha'', the sacrificial post. In that hymn, a description is found of the beginningless and endless ''[[Stambha]]'' or ''Skambha'', and it is shown that the said ''Skambha'' is put in place of the eternal [[Brahman]]. Just as the [[Yajna]] (sacrificial) fire, its smoke, ashes, and flames, the ''Soma'' plant, and the ox that used to carry on its back the wood for the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic sacrifice]] gave place to the conceptions of the brightness of Shiva's body, his tawny matted hair, his blue throat, and the riding on the bull of the Shiva, the ''Yupa-Skambha'' gave place in time to the ''Shiva-Linga''.&lt;ref name="E.U.Harding"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Harding  | first = Elizabeth U.  | title = Kali: The Black Goddess of Dakshineswar  | chapter = God, the Father  | publisher = Motilal Banarsidass  | year = 1998  | pages = 156–157  | isbn = 978-8120814509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paris_congress"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Vivekananda  | first = Swami  | title = The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda  | chapter = The Paris congress of the history of religions  | chapter-url = http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_4/translation_prose/the_paris_congress.htm  | volume = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the text ''Linga Purana'', the same hymn is expanded in the shape of stories, meant to establish the glory of the great Stambha and the superiority of Shiva as Mahadeva.&lt;ref name="paris_congress" /&gt;

=== Avatars ===
[[Puranas|Puranic scriptures]] contain occasional references to "ansh" – literally 'portion, or avatars of Shiva', but the idea of Shiva avatars is not universally accepted in [[Shaivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parrinder| first= Edward Geoffrey |title=Avatar and incarnation |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1982 |page= 88 |isbn=0195203615 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Linga Purana mentions twenty-eight forms of Shiva which are sometimes seen as avatars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Winternitz|first=Moriz|author2=V.

Maha Shivaratri is a major Hindu festival, but one that is solemn and theologically marks a remembrance of "overcoming darkness and ignorance" in life and the world,{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=269}} and meditation about the polarities of existence, of Shiva and a devotion to humankind.&lt;ref name="Raj2012p152" /&gt; It is observed by reciting Shiva-related poems, chanting prayers, remembering Shiva, fasting, doing [[Yoga]] and meditating on ethics and virtues such as self-restraint, honesty, noninjury to others, forgiveness, introspection, self-repentance and the discovery of Shiva.{{sfnm|1a1=Jones|1a2=Ryan|1y=2006|1p=269|Long|1982|2pp=189–217}} The ardent devotees keep awake all night.

Those who visit temples, offer milk, fruits, flowers, fresh leaves and sweets to the lingam.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|pp=137, 186}} Some communities organize special dance events, to mark Shiva as the lord of dance, with individual and group performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cath Senker|title=My Hindu Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lGZ5dWKRw5EC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2007|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1404237315|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jones and Ryan, Maha Sivaratri is an ancient Hindu festival which probably originated around the 5th-century.{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=269}}

Another major festival involving Shiva worship is [[Kartik Purnima]], commemorating [[Tripurantaka|Shiva's victory]] over the three demons known as [[Tripurasura]]. Across India, various Shiva temples are illuminated throughout the night. Shiva icons are carried in procession in some places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Muriel Marion Underhill|title=The Hindu Religious Year|year=1991|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=8120605233| pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thiruvathira]] is a festival observed in Kerala dedicated to Shiva.

Regional festivals dedicated to Shiva include the [[Chithirai festival]] in [[Madurai]] around April/May, one of the largest festivals in South India, celebrating the wedding of [[Minakshi]] (Parvati) and Shiva. The festival is one where both the Vaishnava and Shaiva communities join the celebrations, because Vishnu gives away his sister Minakshi in marriage to Shiva.{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|pp=112–113}}

Some Shaktism-related festivals revere Shiva along with the goddess considered primary and Supreme. These include festivals dedicated to [[Annapurna (goddess)|Annapurna]] such as ''Annakuta'' and those related to Durga.{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|pp=39, 140}} In [[Himalayas|Himalayan regions]] such as [[Nepal]], as well as in northern, central and western India, the festival of [[Teej]] is celebrated by girls and women in the monsoon season, in honor of goddess Parvati, with group singing, dancing and by offering prayers in Parvati-Shiva temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Manju Bhatnagar| title=The Monsoon Festival Teej in Rajasthan| year=1988|volume=47|number=1| jstor=1178252| journal=Asian Folklore Studies|pages=63–72| doi=10.2307/1178252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Skinner | first1=Debra | last2=Holland | first2=Dorothy | last3=Adhikari | first3=G.

The biggest is in [[Allahabad|Prayaga]] (renamed Allahabad during the Mughal rule era), where millions of Hindus of different traditions gather at the confluence of rivers [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]].

In [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Indonesian Shaivism]] the popular name for Shiva has been ''[[Batara Guru]]'', which is derived from Sanskrit ''Bhattāraka'' which means "noble lord".{{sfn|Ghose|1966|pp=16, 123, 494–495, 550–552}} He is conceptualized as a kind spiritual teacher, the first of all [[Guru]]s in Indonesian Hindu texts, mirroring the Dakshinamurti aspect of Shiva in the [[Indian subcontinent]].{{sfn|Ghose|1966|pp=130–131, 550–552}} However, the Batara Guru has more aspects than the Indian Shiva, as the Indonesian Hindus blended their spirits and heroes with him. Batara Guru's wife in [[Southeast Asia]] is the same Hindu deity [[Durga]], who has been popular since ancient times, and she too has a complex character with benevolent and fierce manifestations, each visualized with different names such as Uma, Sri, Kali and others.&lt;ref&gt;Hariani Santiko (1997), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1178725 The Goddess Durgā in the East-Javanese Period] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822214426/https://www.jstor.org/stable/1178725 |date=22 August 2018 }}, Asian Folklore Studies, Vol. 56, No. 2, pp. 209–226&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ghose|1966|pp=15–17}} In contrast to Hindu religious texts, whether Vedas or Puranas, in [[wayang|Javanese puppetry (wayang)]] books, Batara Guru is the king of the gods who regulates and creates the world system. In the classic book that is used as a reference for the puppeteers, it is said that Sanghyang Manikmaya or Batara Guru was created from a sparkling light by Sang Hyang Tunggal, along with the blackish light which is the origin of Ismaya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ensiklopedi wayang Indonesia: A-B |volume=1 |editor=Sena Wangi |publisher=Sekretariat Nasional Pewayangan Indonesia |year=1999 |isbn=9799240018 |language=id |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pN9kAAAAMAAJ |page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IytwAAAAMAAJ |page=525 |title=The British in Java, 1811–1816: a Javanese account |volume=10 |series=Oriental documents |editor=P.

The Indonesian Hindu texts present the same philosophical diversity of Shaivite traditions found in the Indian subcontinent. However, among the texts that have survived into the contemporary era, the more common are of those of [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] (locally also called Siwa Siddhanta, Sridanta).{{sfn|Ghose|1966|pp=155–157, 462–463}}

During the pre-Islamic period on the island of [[Java]], Shaivism and Buddhism were considered very close and allied religions, though not identical religions.{{sfn|Ghose|1966|pp=160–165}} The medieval-era Indonesian literature equates Buddha with Siwa (Shiva) and Janardana (Vishnu).&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Moens (1974), ''Het Buddhisme Java en Sumatra in Zijn laatste boeiperiods'', T.B.G., pp. 522–539, 550; {{oclc|10404094}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition continues in predominantly Hindu Bali Indonesia in the modern era, where Buddha is considered the younger brother of Shiva.{{sfn|Ghose|1966|pp=4–6, 14–16, 94–96, 160–161, 253}}

The worship of Shiva became popular in [[Central Asia]] through the influence of the [[Hephthalite Empire]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;P. 377 ''Classical Hinduism'' By Mariasusai Dhavamony&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kushan Empire]].

In [[Mahayana Buddhism]], Shiva is depicted as [[Maheśvara (Buddhism)|Maheshvara]], a deva living in [[Akaniṣṭha|Akanishta Devaloka]].

In [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], Shiva is depicted as [[Mahakala]], a dharma protecting [[Bodhisattva]]. In most forms of Buddhism, the position of Shiva is lesser than that of [[Mahabrahma]] or [[Sakra (Buddhism)|Sakra Indra]].

'''Ila''' ({{lang-sa|इल}}) or '''Ilā''' ({{lang-sa|इला}}) is a deity in [[Hindu mythology|Hindu legends]], known for their sex changes. As a man, he is known as Ila or '''Sudyumna''' and as a woman, is called Ilā. Ilā is considered the chief progenitor of the [[Lunar dynasty]] of Indian kings – also known as the Aillas ("descendants of Ilā").

While many versions of the tale exist, Ila is usually described as a daughter or son of [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Vaivasvata Manu]] and thus the sibling of [[Ikshvaku (Hinduism)|Ikshvaku]], the founder of the [[Solar Dynasty]]. In versions in which Ila is born female, she changes into a male form by divine grace soon after her birth. After mistakenly entering a sacred grove as an adult, Ila is either cursed to change his/her gender every month or cursed to become a woman. As a woman, Ilā married [[Budha]], the god of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and the son of the lunar deity [[Chandra]] (Soma), and bore him a son called [[Pururavas]], the father of the Lunar dynasty. After the birth of Pururavas, Ilā has transformed into a man again and fathered three sons.

In the [[Vedas]], Ilā is praised as '''Idā''' ({{lang-sa|इडा}}), goddess of speech, and described as the mother of Pururavas.

The tale of Ila's transformations is told in the [[Puranas]] as well as the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic poems]], the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.

==Birth==

According to the ''[[Linga Purana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', Ilā was born as the eldest daughter of Vaivasvata Manu, the progenitor of mankind, and his wife Shraddha. However, the parents desired a son and so prayed and performed austerities to propitiate the deities [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]] and [[Varuna]], who changed Ilā's gender. The boy was named Sudyumma.&lt;ref name="LP_MBH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite book|last= Williams|first=George Mason|title=Handbook of Hindu mythology|publisher=ABC-CLIO Inc.|location=Saint Barbara|year=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9791576071068/page/156 156]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9791576071068 |url-access= registration| isbn=978-1-57607-106-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', the ''[[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]]'',&lt;ref name="bhagavat"&gt;For translation, see {{cite book|last=Swami Vijnanananda|title=The S'Rimad Devi Bhagawatam|publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC|year=2008|volume=1|pages=62–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kt02ZSt2Q8AC&amp;q=Ila+Budha&amp;pg=PA62|orig-year = 1921 | isbn=978-1-4375-3059-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Kurma Purana]]'', the ''[[Harivamsa]]'', the ''[[Markandeya Purana]]'' and the ''[[Padma Purana]]'' (referred to as "''Bhagavata Purana'' et al. texts" further)  narrate a variant: Ila's parents could not have any children for a long time and approached the sage [[Agastya]] for a solution. The sage performed a [[yajna]] (fire sacrifice) dedicated to Mitra and Varuna to attain a son for the couple. Due to either an error in the ritual or a failure to offer the appropriate sacrifice, Mitra and Varuna instead sent a daughter to the couple. In one version, the couple supplicated the deities, who transformed Ilā's gender. In another version, this transformation happens after the erroneous hymns are rectified and the son is called Ila.&lt;ref name = "williams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP_KP"&gt;O'Flaherty pp. 303-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pattanaik46"/&gt;&lt;ref name=connerila/&gt; According to a variant, Shraddha wished for a daughter; [[Vashistha]] heeded her wish while performing the sacrifice and thus, a daughter was born. However, Manu desired a son so Vashistha appealed to Vishnu to change the gender of his daughter. Ilā was renamed Sudhyumna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=D.

In the ''[[Ramayana]]'', Ila is born as a son of Kardama, the [[Prajapati]] born of the god [[Brahma]]'s shadow. Ila's tale is told in the ''Uttara Kanda'' chapter of the Ramayana, while describing the greatness of the [[Ashvamedha]] – the horse sacrifice.&lt;ref name = "Pattanaik46"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swami Venkatesananda |title=The concise Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1988|pages=397–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curse and marriage to Budha==
[[File: King Ila argument with Bhuda son of Chandra.jpg|thumb|The male Ila with Budha.]]  
In the ''Ramayana'', the ''[[Linga Purana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', Ila grows to become the king of [[Bactria|Bahlika]]. While hunting in a forest, Ila accidentally trespassed Sharavana ("Forest of Reeds"), the sacred grove of the goddess [[Parvati]], the consort of the god [[Shiva]]. Upon entering Sharavana, all-male beings except for Shiva, including trees and animals, are transformed into females.&lt;ref group = "Notes"&gt;Sharavaṇa ("Forest of Reeds") is described as the place where [[Murugan|Skanda]], the son of Shiva, was born. The ''Devi-Bhagavata Purana'' narrates that once the sages intruded on the love-making of Shiva and Parvati so Shiva cursed the forest that all-male beings entering it would be transformed into females.&lt;/ref&gt; One legend tells that a female ''[[yakshini]]'' disguised herself as a deer and purposefully led Ila to the grove in order to save her husband from the king.&lt;ref name="Shulman" /&gt; The ''Linga Purana'' and the ''Mahabharata'' emphasize the sex change of Ila to be a deliberate act of Shiva to start the Lunar dynasty.&lt;ref name="LP_MBH"&gt;For Linga Purana and Mahabharata, O'Flaherty p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' et al. texts tell that Ila's entire entourage, as well as his horse, also changed their genders.&lt;ref name="BP_KP"/&gt;

According to the ''[[Ramayana]]'', when Ila approached [[Shiva]] for help, Shiva laughed with scorn but the compassionate Parvati reduced the curse and allowed Ila to switch genders every month. However, as a male, he would not remember his life as a female and vice versa. While Ilā roamed the forest in her new form with her female attendants, [[Budha]], the god of the [[planet Mercury]] and the son of the moon-god [[Chandra]], noticed her. Although he had been practising [[asceticism]], Ilā's beauty caused him to fall in love with her at first sight. Budha turned Ilā's attendants into ''[[Kimpurusha Kingdom|Kimpurusha]]s'' ([[hermaphrodite]], lit. "is it a man?")&lt;ref name=p1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vanita, Kidwai p.18&lt;/ref&gt; and ordered them to run away, promising that they would find mates as Ilā had.&lt;ref name="rama"&gt;For Ramayana, Meyer pp. 374-5 or Shulman pp. 58-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Ilā married Budha and spent an entire month with him and consummated the marriage. However, Ilā woke one morning as Sudyumna and remembered nothing about the past month. [[Budha]] told Ila that his retinue had been killed in a rain of stones and convinced Ila to stay with him for a year. During each month she spent as a woman, Ilā had a good time with Budha. During each month as a man, Ila turned to pious ways and performed austerities under the guidance of Budha. In the ninth month, Ilā gave birth to [[Pururavas]], who grew to become the first king of the Lunar dynasty. Then, as per the advice of Budha and Ila's father Kardama, Ila pleased Shiva and Shiva restored Ila's masculinity permanently.&lt;ref name = "Pattanaik46"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "rama"/&gt;

Another legend from the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' credits Vishnu of restoring Ilā's manhood as Sudyumma.&lt;ref name = "williams"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Flaherty p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Bhagavata Purana'' et al. texts tell that after Pururavas's birth, the nine brothers of Ila – by horse-sacrifice – or the sage Vasistha – the family priest of Ila – pleased Shiva to compel him to give the boon of alternate month manhood to Ila, turning him into a ''Kimpurusha''.&lt;ref name = bhagavat/&gt;&lt;ref name="BP_KP"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Shashi"/&gt; The ''Linga Purana'' and the ''Mahabharata'' record the birth of Pururavas, but do not narrate the end of Ila's alternating gender condition. In fact, the ''Mahabharata'' describes Ilā to be the mother as well as the father of Pururavas.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; According to another account found in the ''Vayu Purana'' and the ''Brahmanda Purana'', Ilā was born female, married Budha, then was transformed into a male called Sudyumna. Sudyumna was then cursed by Parvati and transformed once again into a female, but became a man once again through Shiva's boon.&lt;ref name=p1/&gt;

In almost all versions of the tale, Ila wants to live as a man, but in the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'', Ila desires to be a woman. The king Ela (Ila) entered Parvati's grove at [[Sahya Mountains|Sahya]] mountain and became the woman Ilā. Ilā wished to remain a woman and serve Parvati (Gauri) and [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganga]], the goddess of the [[Ganges]] river. However, the goddesses dissuaded him. Ilā bathed in a sacred pool and returned as Ela, bearded and deep-voiced.&lt;ref name = "Pattanaik46"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shulman pp. 61-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and descendants==
The descendants of Ilā through [[Pururavas]] are known as Ailas after Ilā or as the [[Lunar Dynasty|Lunar dynasty]] (Chandravamsha) due to their descent from Budha, the son of the moon-god Chandra.{{sfn|Thapar|2013|p=308}}&lt;ref name = "Pattanaik46"&gt;Pattanaik p.46&lt;/ref&gt; Most versions of the tale call Ilā the father as well as the mother of the Ailas.&lt;ref name = "Pattanaik47"/&gt; The ''[[Linga Purana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', in which Sudyumma's curse does not end, state that as a male, Sudyumma also bore three sons named Utkala, Gaya and [[Vinatashva]] (also known as Haritashva and Vinata).&lt;ref name=p1/&gt; The three sons ruled the kingdom for their father as Sudyumma was unable to do so himself due to his alternating gender. The sons and their principalities are called the ''Saudyumna''s. Utkala, Gaya, and Vinatashva ruled [[Utkala Kingdom|Utkala]] country, [[Gaya, India|Gaya]], and eastern regions including northern [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kurus]] respectively.&lt;ref name=p2&gt;Pargiter, F.E. (1972).

He was succeeded by Pururavas.&lt;ref name="LP_MBH"/&gt;

In the ''[[Matsya Purana]]'', Ila was disinherited after becoming a female or ''kimpurusha''. Ila's father passed his inheritance directly to Pururavas, ignoring the three sons Ila-Sudyumma bore as a male. Pururavas ruled from Pratishtanapura (present-day [[Allahabad]]), where Ila stayed with him.&lt;ref name = "Shashi"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia Indica: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh|editor=Shashi, Shyam Singh|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT.

His subjects were disturbed by his sex changes and did not respect him as they once had. When Pururavas attained adulthood, Sudyumma left his kingdom to Pururavas and went to the forest for penance. The sage [[Narada]] told Sudyumma a nine-syllable [[mantra]], ''Navakshara'', which would please the [[Mahadevi|Supreme Goddess]]. Pleased with his austerities, the Goddess emerged before Sudyumma, who was in his female form Ilā. Sudyumma praised the Goddess, who merged the king's soul with herself and thus, Ilā gained salvation.&lt;ref name = bhagavat/&gt;

The ''Bhagavata Purana'', the ''Devi-Bhagavata Purana'' and the ''Linga Purana'' declare that Ila ascended to heaven with both male and female anatomy.&lt;ref name = "Pattanaik47"&gt;Pattanaik p.47&lt;/ref&gt; Ila is considered the chief progenitor of the Lunar Dynasty through Pururavas and of the Solar Dynasty through his brother Iksavaku and sons Utkala, Gaya, and Vinatashva.&lt;ref name = "Shashi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Jainism|editor=Singh, Narendra|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. LTD.|year=2001|page=1724}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage of Ilā, a descendant of the Sun, and Budha, the son of the Moon, is the first union of the solar and lunar races recorded in the scriptures.&lt;ref name="Shulman" /&gt;

==In Vedic literature==
In [[Vedic Literature|Vedic literature]], Ilā is also known as Idā. Idā, in the ''[[Rigveda]]'', signifies food and refreshment, personified as the goddess of speech.&lt;ref name = "dowson"/&gt; Ilā-Idā is also associated with [[Sarasvati]], the goddess of knowledge.&lt;ref name=connerila&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 183, "Ila/Sudyumna"&lt;/ref&gt; Ilā-Idā is mentioned a number of times in the ''[[Rigveda]]'', mostly in the hymns known as [[Āprīsūktas|''Āprīsūkta''s]]. She is often mentioned along with Sarasvati and Bharati (or Mahi) and Pururavas is described as her son.&lt;ref&gt;Misra, V.S. (2007).

In the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'', [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] performed a fire-sacrifice in order to have children. Idā emerged from the sacrifice.

Brahma is commonly depicted as a red or golden-[[complexion]]ed bearded man with four heads and hands. His four heads represent the four Vedas and are pointed to the four cardinal directions. He is seated on a lotus and his ''[[vahana]]'' (mount) is a ''[[hamsa (bird)|hamsa]]'' (swan, goose or crane).

In contemporary Hinduism, Brahma does not enjoy popular worship and has substantially less important than the other two members of the Trimurti.

==Origin and meaning==
The origins of the term {{IAST|brahmā}} are uncertain, partly because several related words are found in the Vedic literature, such as ''[[Brahman]]'' for the 'Ultimate Reality' and [[Brahmin|''Brāhmaṇa'']] for 'priest'. A distinction between the spiritual concept of ''brahman'' and the deity Brahmā is that the former is a genderless abstract metaphysical concept in Hinduism,&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, Brahman, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 122&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter is one of the many masculine gods in Hindu tradition.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, Brahma, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 119&lt;/ref&gt; The spiritual concept of ''brahman'' is quite old and some scholars suggest that the deity Brahma may have emerged as a personification and visible icon of the impersonal universal principle ''of brahman''.&lt;ref name="brucesullivan"&gt;Bruce Sullivan (1999), Seer of the Fifth Veda, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816763}}, pages 82-83&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of a distinct deity named ''Brahma'' is evidenced in late Vedic texts.&lt;ref name="brucesullivan" /&gt;

Grammatically, the nominal stem ''Brahma-'' has two distinct forms: the [[Neuter (grammar)|neuter]] noun ''bráhman'', whose [[nominative case|nominative singular form]] is ''{{IAST|brahma}}'' ({{lang|sa|ब्रह्म}}); and the [[Masculine (grammar)|masculine]] noun ''brahmán'', whose nominative singular form is ''{{IAST|brahmā}}'' ({{lang|sa|ब्रह्मा}}). The former, the neuter form, has a generalized and abstract meaning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gopal|first=Madan|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|title=India through the ages|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|year=1990|editor=K.S.

One of the earliest mentions of Brahma with Vishnu and Shiva is in the fifth ''Prapathaka'' (lesson) of the ''[[Maitrayaniya Upanishad]]'', probably composed around the late 1st millennium BCE. Brahma is first discussed in verse 5,1,  also called the ''Kutsayana Hymn'', and then expounded in verse 5,2.&lt;ref name=hume51&gt;{{citation|first=Robert Ernest|last=Hume|author-link=Robert Ernest Hume|title=The Thirteen Principal Upanishads |url=https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n443/mode/2up|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1921|pages=422–424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the pantheistic ''Kutsayana Hymn'',&lt;ref name=hume51/&gt; the Upanishad asserts that one's Soul is Brahman, and this Ultimate Reality, Cosmic Universal or God is within each living being. It equates the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|''atman'']] (Soul, Self) within to be Brahma and various alternate manifestations of Brahman, as follows, "Thou art Brahma, thou art Vishnu, thou art Rudra (Shiva), thou art [[Agni]], [[Varuna]], [[Vayu]], [[Indra]], thou art All."&lt;ref name=hume51/&gt;

In verse (5,2), Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva are mapped into the theory of [[Guṇa]], that is qualities, psyche and innate tendencies the text describes can be found in all living beings.&lt;ref name=maxmuller51&gt;[[Max Müller|Max Muller]], The Upanishads, Part 2, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/302/mode/2up Maitrayana-Brahmana Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages 303-304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Gonda (1968), The Hindu Trinity, Anthropos, Vol. 63, pages 215-219&lt;/ref&gt; This chapter of the ''[[Maitri Upanishad]]'' asserts that the universe emerged from darkness (''[[Tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]''), first as passion characterized by innate quality (''[[rajas]]''), which then refined and differentiated into purity and goodness (''[[sattva]]'').&lt;ref name=hume51/&gt;&lt;ref name=maxmuller51/&gt; Of these three qualities, ''rajas'' are then mapped to ''Brahma'', as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 344-346&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;
|[[Maitrayaniya Upanishad|Maitri Upanishad]] 5.2|&lt;ref name=hume51/&gt;&lt;ref name=maxmuller51/&gt;}}

While the ''Maitri Upanishad'' maps Brahma with one of the elements of ''the guṇa'' theory of Hinduism, the text does not depict him as one of the trifunctional elements of the Hindu ''Trimurti'' idea found in later Puranic literature.&lt;ref&gt;GM Bailey (1979), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269716 Trifunctional Elements in the theology of the Hindu Trimūrti], Numen, Vol. 26, Fasc. 2, pages 152-163&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Vedic, Epics and Puranas===
[[File:Sheshashayi Vishnu.jpg|thumb|upright|In [[Vaishnava]] Puranic scriptures, Brahma emerges on a lotus from Vishnu's navel as Vishnu (Mahavishnu) creates the cosmic cycle. Shaivite texts describe that Shiva told Vishnu to create, Shiva ordered Vishnu to make Brahma.&lt;ref name=bryant18/&gt;]]

During the post-Vedic period, Brahma was a prominent deity and his sect existed during the 2nd to 6th century CE. Early texts like [[Brahmananda Purana]] describe that there was nothing but an eternal ocean. From this, a golden egg called [[Hiranyagarbha]], emerged. The egg broke open and Brahma, who had created himself within it, came into existence (gaining the name [[Swayambhu]]). Then, he created the universe, the earth and other things. He also created people to populate and live on his creation.&lt;ref name = "ACK" &gt;{{Cite book|last=Srinivasan|first=Shalini|title=Stories of Creation|date=April 1971|publisher=Amar Chitra Katha private limited|isbn=8184826478}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Fall" &gt;{{Cite book|last=Achuthananda|first=Swami|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F9FqDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Brahma|title=The Ascent of Vishnu and the Fall of Brahma|date=2018-08-27|publisher=Relianz Communications Pty Ltd|isbn=978-0-9757883-3-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Dalal1" &gt;{{Cite book|last=Dalal|first=Roshen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;q=Brahma|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|date=2010|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|language=en|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by the 7th century, Brahma lost his importance. Puranic legends mention various reasons for his downfall. There are primarily two prominent versions of why Brahma lost his ground. The first version refers to Shiva Purana, where Brahma and Vishnu argued about who was the greatest among them. Then suddenly, they heard a voice and saw a huge lightning pillar. The voice asked them to find out the end of the pillar and whoever could find the end of the pillar would be the greatest. Vishnu went toward the bottom and Brahma went toward the top. Vishnu came back and accepted his defeat that he couldn't find the end. However, Brahma returned and lied that he could find the top end. The pillar was [[Shiva Linga]] and the voice was of Shiva and this lie infuriated Shiva. Angry Shiva cursed Brahma that he would never be worshiped henceforth.

Historians believe that some of the major reasons for Brahma's downfall were the rise of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, their replacement of him with Shakti in the Smarta tradition and the frequent attacks by Buddhists, Jains and even by Hindu followers of Vaishnavas and Shaivites.&lt;ref name="Dalal1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fall" /&gt;

The post-Vedic texts of Hinduism offer multiple theories of [[cosmogony]], many involving Brahma. These include ''Sarga'' (primary creation of the universe) and ''Visarga'' (secondary creation), ideas related to the Indian thought that there are two levels of reality, one primary that is unchanging ([[metaphysics|metaphysical]]) and other secondary that is always changing ([[empiricism|empirical]]), and that all observed reality of the latter is in an endlessly repeating cycle of existence, that cosmos and life we experience is continually created, evolved, dissolved and then re-created.&lt;ref name=tpinchman125&gt;Tracy Pintchman (1994), The Rise of the Goddess in the Hindu Tradition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791421123}}, pages 122-138&lt;/ref&gt; The primary creator is extensively discussed in Vedic cosmogonies with ''Brahman'' or ''[[Purusha]]'' or ''[[Devi]]'' among the terms used for the primary creator,&lt;ref name=tpinchman125/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Gonda (1969), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40457085 The Hindu Trinity], Anthropos, Bd 63/64, H 1/2, pages 213-214&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast the Vedic and post-Vedic texts name different gods and goddesses as secondary creators (often Brahma in post-Vedic texts), and in some cases a different god or goddess is the secondary creator at the start of each cosmic cycle (''kalpa'', aeon).&lt;ref name="Stella Kramrisch 1994 pages 205-206"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tpinchman125/&gt;

In the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', Brahma is portrayed several times as the one who rises from the "Ocean of Causes".&lt;ref name=richard&gt;Richard Anderson (1967), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1769398  Hindu Myths in Mallarmé: Un Coup de Dés], Comparative Literature, Vol. 19, No. 1, pages 28-35&lt;/ref&gt; Brahma, states this Purana, emerges at the moment when time and universe are born, inside a lotus rooted in the navel of ''Hari'' (deity Vishnu, whose praise is the primary focus in the Purana). The scriptures assert that Brahma is drowsy, errs and is temporarily incompetent as he puts together the universe.&lt;ref name=richard/&gt; He then becomes aware of his confusion and drowsiness, meditates as an ascetic, then realizes ''Hari'' in his heart, sees the beginning and end of the universe, and then his creative powers are revived. Brahma, states Bhagavata Purana, thereafter combines ''[[Prakriti]]'' (nature, matter) and ''[[Purusha]]'' (spirit, soul) to create a dazzling variety of living creatures, and a tempest of causal nexus.&lt;ref name=richard/&gt; The Bhagavata Purana thus attributes the creation of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] to Brahma,{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} wherein he creates for the sake of creation, imbuing everything with both the good and the evil, the material and the spiritual, a beginning and an end.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Anderson (1967), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1769398  Hindu Myths in Mallarmé: Un Coup de Dés], Comparative Literature, Vol. 19, No. 1, page 31-33&lt;/ref&gt;

The Puranas describe Brahma as the deity creating time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} They correlate human time to Brahma's time, such as a [[Kalpa (aeon)|mahākalpa]] being a large cosmic period, correlating to one day and one night in Brahma's existence.&lt;ref name="Continuum"/&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

The stories about Brahma in various Puranas are diverse and inconsistent. In [[Skanda Purana]], for example, goddess Parvati is called the "mother of the universe", and she is credited with creating Brahma, gods, and the three worlds. She is the one, states Skanda Purana, who combined the three ''Gunas'' - Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas - into matter (''Prakrti'') to create the empirically observed world.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Gier (1998), The Yogi and the Goddess, International Journal of Hindu Studies, Vol. 1, No. 2, pages 279-280&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vedic discussion of Brahma as a ''Rajas''-quality god expands in the Puranic and [[Tantra|Tantric]] literature. However, these texts state that his wife [[Saraswati]] has ''[[Sattva]]'' (quality of balance, harmony, goodness, purity, holistic, constructive, creative, positive, peaceful, virtuous), thus complementing Brahma's ''Rajas'' (quality of passion, activity, neither good nor bad and sometimes either, action qua action, individualizing, driven, dynamic).&lt;ref&gt;H Woodward (1989), The Lakṣmaṇa Temple, Khajuraho and Its Meanings, Ars Orientalis, Vol. 19, pages 30-34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alban Widgery (1930), The principles of Hindu Ethics, International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 40, No. 2, pages 234-237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Alter]] (2004), Yoga in modern India, Princeton University Press, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Brahma is associated largely with the Vedic culture of [[yajna]] and knowledge. In some Vedic [[yajna]], Brahma is summoned in the ritual to reside and supervise the ritual in the form of [[Prajapati]].

In [[Prambanan]] there is a special temple made for Brahma, side by side with Vishnu, and in [[Bali]] there is Andakasa Temple dedicated to Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= https://baliexpress.jawapos.com/read/2017/08/24/9520/menyingkap-misteri-dewa-brahma-jarang-dipuja |title= Menyingkap Misteri Dewa Brahma Jarang Dipuja (Indonesian)|work=Baliexpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, although not as popular as Vishnu and Shiva, the name Brahma appeared on several occasions. In the legend that developed in [[East Java]] about Ken Arok, for example, Brahma is believed to be the biological father of [[Ken Arok]]. It is said that Brahma was fascinated by the beauty of Ken Arok's mother, Ken Endok and made her a lover. From this relationship was born Ken Arok. The name Brahma is also used as the name of a mountain in the Tengger Mountains range, namely [[Mount Bromo]]. Mount Bromo is believed to be derived from the word Brahma and there was once a sect that believed that Brahmaloka – the universe where Brahma resided – was connected to Mount Bromo.

In the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] version of [[wayang]](shadow puppet play), Brahma has a very different role from his initial role. When Hindu society began to disappear from [[Java]] and the era of [[Walisongo]]'s [[wayang kulit]] began to emerge, Brahma's role as creator in the shadow puppet standard was given to a figure named Sang Hyang Wenang, while Brahma himself was renamed to Brama (fire) where he was a ruling god. Brama, the son of the figure of [[Bathara Guru]] (Shiva). The figure of Brahma in Javanese wayang is fused and mixed with the figure of Agni.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= https://gamabali.com/dewa-brahma/|title=Dewa Brahma|work=GamaBali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Skanda Purana|Kanda Puranam]], the deity Murugan is regarded to have battled the [[asura]] [[Śūrapadmā|Surapadman]] with the divine spear given to him by his mother, [[Parvati]]. After Surapadman had assumed the form of a tree, Murugan used his spear to split the asura into two. These halves became a peacock, which Murugan took as his [[Vahana|mount]], and a rooster, which he adopted as his flag. This legend is celebrated on the occasion of Skanda Shashti.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Melton |first=J.

== Origin ==
{{Vaishnavism}}
In the [[Samaveda|Sama Veda]], '''Om Namo Narayanaya'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' is said to have been taught by [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] sages to the seekers who came to them for wisdom. It is traditionally believed that this mantra revealed its significance and meaning to these sages through their penances, after which they shared it with seekers as a means of self-realisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Debroy |first=Bibek |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tM49EAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=sama+veda+om+namo+narayanaya&amp;pg=PT311 |title=Brahma Purana Volume 1 |date=2022-01-24 |publisher=Penguin Random House India Private Limited |isbn=978-93-91149-73-4 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==
[[File:Hindoo Gods; Wallpaper.jpg|thumb|A painting of Narayana]]
''Om Namo Narayanaya'' is heavily featured in [[Hindu texts|Hindu literature]], especially in the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Puranas]]. The mantra is often specified as being invoked by the characters of these scriptures to gain salvation from the deity, and as an instruction to the devotees of Narayana in the performance of rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Makarand Joshi |url=http://archive.org/details/varahapuranaeng2volumesin1fileocrmotilalbanasirdass1960 |title=Varaha Purana ENG 2 Volumes In 1 File OCR Motilal Banasirdass 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Tarasara Upanishad]], ''om'' is the divine sacred syllable that represents the nature of [[Brahman]], the Ultimate Reality that is unchanging and eternal. ''Namo'' can be translated from Sanskrit as “to bow to” or “to pay homage to”, as well as refer to an individual's name. ''Narayanaya'' is a term that may be translated as "to or of Narayana". ''Nara'' refers to “water”, and ''anaya'' means “abode” or “shelter.” Narayana is an epithet of Vishnu, whose celestial realm is [[Vaikuntha]], amid the cosmic waters of creation. Hence, it is a mantra that is associated with submission to [[Brahman|God]], accepting one's existence in the grand design, as well as seeking the protection of Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Narayanasvami Aiyar |first=K. |url=http://archive.org/details/thirtyminorupani00xxxxuoft |title=Thirty minor Upanishads |date=1914 |publisher=Madras : Printed by Annie Besant at the Vasanta Press |others=Robarts - University of Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sage and philosopher [[Yajnavalkya]] provides an explanation of the breakdown of the components of the mantra:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Narayanasvami Aiyar |first=K. |url=http://archive.org/details/thirtyminorupani00xxxxuoft |title=Thirty minor Upanishads |date=1914 |publisher=Madras : Printed by Annie Besant at the Vasanta Press |others=Robarts - University of Toronto |pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Vaishnava Upanishads]], the ''Samashti-Yantra'', the words described over [[Shesha|Ananta]], the seat of Vishnu, bear the ''ashtakshara.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brahmayogin |first=Upanishad |url=https://archive.org/details/108_Upanishads_with_Sanskrit_Commentary_of_Upanishad_Brahma_Yogin |title=108 Upanishads with Sanskrit Commentary of Upanishad Brahma Yogin |publisher=Adyar Library |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Naradiya Purana|Narada Purana]] furnishes the following details regarding the chanting of this mantra: If a man performs the [[japa]] of chanting the mantra in the banks of the river [[Ganges|Ganga]], he would achieve [[moksha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Makarand Joshi |url=http://archive.org/details/naradapuranaeng051952ocrmotilalbanasirdass |title=Narada Purana ENG 05 1952 OCR Motilal Banasirdass |pages=1766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Narayana Upanishad]] also remarks upon the mantra, stating that one attains [[Vaikuntha]] by chanting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/108upanishad_201910 |title=108 Upanishad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mantra is also often associated with [[Prahlada]], a [[daitya]] devotee of Narayana, and the son of [[Hiranyakashipu]]. Despite repeated instruction by his instructors to chant the invocation, "''Hiranyaya namah''" (glory to Hiranya), the devotee sticks to his favoured mantra, "''Om Namo Narayanaya Namah''" (glory to Narayana).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Muthukumaraswamy |first1=M.

== Historical usage ==
[[Periyalvar]], an [[Alvars|Alvar]], a poet-saint of the [[Sri Vaishnavism|Sri Vaishnava]] tradition, invoked the mantra to convince the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya]] king of [[Madurai]] of the supremacy of Vishnu. He proclaimed that Narayana was the supreme deity, all-merciful and all-bountiful, and that he was the path towards the achievement of bliss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Shuddhananda Bharati |url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.68160 |title=Alvar Saints |date=1942 |pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mantra is held in supreme regard by the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavas]], the adherents of Vishnu who make up the dominant denomination within Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Todd M. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/826899669 |title=The worlds religions in figures : an introduction to international religious demography |date=2013 |others=Gina A. Bellofatto |isbn=978-1-118-32303-8 |location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK |oclc=826899669}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious significance of chanting this incantation is described in the [[Tarasara Upanishad]], stating that he who chants the mantra is purified by the deities [[Agni]], [[Vayu]], [[Surya]], as well as [[Shiva]]. The merit attained by chanting it is described to be the equivalent of reciting the [[Itihasa|Itihasas]], the [[Puranas]], and all the mantras a hundred thousand times. It is also stated to be the equivalent of reciting the [[Gayatri Mantra|Gayatri mantra]] a hundred thousand times, and the syllable '[[Om]]' ten thousand times. It is stated to be powerful enough to purify ten of one's immediate ancestors, and ten of one's immediate descendants. Finally, it states that the recitation of the mantra allows one to attain the state of union with Narayana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Narayanasvami Aiyar |first=K. |url=http://archive.org/details/thirtyminorupani00xxxxuoft |title=Thirty minor Upanishads |date=1914 |publisher=Madras : Printed by Annie Besant at the Vasanta Press |others=Robarts - University of Toronto |pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Linga Purana]] states that chanting the mantra is the means for achieving all objects, and hence must be invoked for every occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Studholme |first=Alexander |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxJWgldrIHoC&amp;dq=om+namo+narayanaya&amp;pg=PA177 |title=The Origins of Om Manipadme Hum: A Study of the Karandavyuha Sutra |date=2012-02-01 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-8848-5 |pages=177 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sri Vaishnavism]], the chanting of the mantra was part of the ''panchasamskaras'' of [[Ramanuja]], the five sacraments that initiated him into the tradition by his guru, Periyanambi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Narasimhacharya |first=Madabhushini |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4rW8nLogjekC&amp;dq=om+namo+narayanaya&amp;pg=PA22 |title=Sri Ramanuja |date=2004 |publisher=Sahitya Akademi |isbn=978-81-260-1833-8 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Vaishnava theology, it is held that whoever studies this ''ashtakshara'' of Narayana and recites it constantly attains a full life, supremacy over men, enjoys the pleasures of royalty, and becomes the master of all souls. Whoever chants this mantra is held to attain [[moksha]], according to the teachings of the Sama Veda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/702548741 |title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda |date=1997 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |others=Paul Deussen, V.

[[File:Ashwatthama uses Narayanastra.jpg|thumb|Ashvatthama uses the Narayanastra]]
In [[Hindu mythology]], the '''Narayanastra''' ({{Lang-sa|नारायणास्त्रम्|lit=Celestial missile of Narayana|translit={{IAST|nārāyaṇāstram}}}}) is an [[Astra (weapon)|astra]], a celestial missile, affiliated to the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity, [[Vishnu]], in his form of [[Narayana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2012-06-29 |title=Narayanastra, Narayana-astra, Nārāyaṇāstra: 6 definitions |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/narayanastra |access-date=2022-09-25 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Description ==
This [[Astra (weapon)|astra]] ("celestial weapon" in Sanskrit) fires a volley of millions of deadly missiles simultaneously, the intensity of which rises in proportion to the resistance of the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Menon|first=Ramesh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uA-2_WMhpzoC&amp;q=narayanastra&amp;pg=PA353|title=The Mahabharata: A Modern Rendering|date=2006|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-40188-8|pages=352–6|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only way to defend against the Narayanastra is, therefore, to show total submission before the missiles hit, which would cause them to stop and spare the target. It is one of the six 'Mantramukta' weapons that cannot be resisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oppert|first1=Gustav Salomon|url=https://archive.org/details/onweaponsarmyor00oppegoog|title=On the Weapons, Army Organisation, and Political Maxims of the Ancient Hindus: With Special Reference to Gunpowder and Firearms|publisher=Higginbotham|year=1880}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also said that it could be used only once in a war; if one tried to use it twice, it would devour the user's own army.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Legend ==
{{Vaishnavism}}
In Hindu mythology, the [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s and the [[asura]]s performed the churning of the ocean of milk ([[Samudra manthan|Samudra Manthana]]) in order to obtain [[amrita]], the elixir of immortality. During this process, fourteen jewels ([[Samudra manthan#Ratnas|ratnas]]) emerged from the ocean. Among the first few treasures that emerged was the kaustubha, described to be an "excellent gem, the lotus-hued ruby".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2020-03-01 |title=Churning of the Ocean: Birth of Fourteen Precious Jewels [Chapter 12] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-skanda-purana/d/doc371751.html |access-date=2022-08-02 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Skanda Purana]] describes the nature of this gem:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2019-12-17 |title=Procedure of Gaṇeśa Worship: Manifestation of Lakṣmī [Chapter 11] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-skanda-purana/d/doc365958.html |access-date=2022-08-02 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Blockquote|text=From the ocean that was being churned emerged a highly refulgent, extremely bright, most excellent gem having the brilliance of the Sun. It was called Kaustubha.

With its brilliance, it illuminated the three worlds. Keeping the Cintāmaṇi (a miraculous stone) in front, they saw the Kaustubha brightening the worlds. All those Suras gave the Kaustubha to Viṣṇu. Suras and Asuras of enhanced strength lustily roared again and began to churn the ocean keeping Cintāmaṇi in the middle.|title=[[Skanda Purana]]|source=Chapter 11, Verses 51 - 53}}
[[Krishna]] is described to be wearing the ruby in the [[Mahabharata]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2015-01-09 |title=Lord Krishna Benedicts the Imprisoned Kings [Chapter 5] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mahabharata/d/doc118385.html |access-date=2022-08-02 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Blockquote|text=Now before them they saw the color of the transcendental body of Lord Krishna, exactly like the hue of a newly arrived cloud in the sky. He appeared before them nicely covered with yellow colored silken garments, with four hands like Vishnu, and carrying the different symbols of the club, the conchshell, the disc and the lotus flower. There were marks of golden lines on His chest, and the nipples of His breast appeared to be like the whorl of a lotus flower. His eyes appeared to be spread like the petals of a lotus flower, and His smiling face exhibited the symbol of eternal peace and prosperity. His glittering earrings were set beautifully, and His helmet was bedecked with valuable jewels. The Lord's necklace of pearls and the bangles and bracelets nicely situated on His body all shone with a transcendental beauty. The Kaustubha jewel hanging on His chest glittered with great luster, and the Lord wore a beautiful flower garland.|author=[[Vyasa]]|title=[[Mahabharata]]|source=Sabha Parva, Chapter 5}}

== Mythology ==
In the [[Vishnu Purana]], in the beginning of time, [[Brahma]] is described to have been created within a lotus blooming from the navel of Vishnu. The ''padma'' is hence prominent in the Vaishnava narrative of [[cosmogony]], where Brahma is instructed by Vishnu to start generating the universe and the rest of creation. The lotus is regarded to be a representation of dharma, the cosmic law, as well the epitome of purity, as it rose beneath the impure seabed towards the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pattanaik |first=Devdutt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zdkswFlJtjQC&amp;pg=PA99 |title=Indian Mythology: Tales, Symbols, and Rituals from the Heart of the Subcontinent |date=2003-04-24 |publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co |isbn=978-0-89281-870-9 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Krishna |first=Nanditha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9cSlaLMlgEC&amp;dq=lotus+narayana&amp;pg=PA24 |title=The Book of Vishnu |date=June 2010 |publisher=Penguin Books India |isbn=978-0-14-306762-7 |pages=24 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Samudra Manthana|Samudra Manthanam]], when [[Lakshmi]] chooses Vishnu as her eternal consort, she throws a garland of lotuses around his neck, and is also eulogised as the lotus-faced one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bhagat |first=Dr S.

The realm of [[Krishna]], [[Goloka]], is evoked as [[Vrindavan|Vrindavana]] upon the earth, portrayed in the form of a lotus. 

Vishnu is generally depicted as holding the lotus in his lower left hand, while his consort [[Lakshmi]] holds one in her right hand, and the goddess is also usually portrayed as sitting on the flower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ph.D |first=Lavanya Vemsani |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4fw2DAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=lotus+vishnu&amp;pg=PA123 |title=Krishna in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Hindu Lord of Many Names: An Encyclopedia of the Hindu Lord of Many Names |date=2016-06-13 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-61069-211-3 |pages=123 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vishnu and Parikshit.jpg|thumb|Vishnu seated upon a lotus and granting an audience to [[Parikshit]]]]
A [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] myth describes Vishnu's worship of [[Shiva]] with 1008 lotus flowers, offering one for each of his epithets. In order to test him, Shiva removed one lotus from the bunch so that Vishnu would be one short and the [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] would be incomplete. However, the omniscient Vishnu merely plucked one of his lotus eyes, placing it upon the [[lingam]]. Pleased, Shiva presents him with the [[Sudarshana Chakra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Vanamali |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BmAoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT148 |title=Shiva: Stories and Teachings from the Shiva Mahapurana |date=2013-10-04 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-62055-249-0 |language=en |chapter=Chapter 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
[[File:Vishnu with Lakshmi on a lotus (6125133540).jpg|thumb|Vishnu and Lakshmi seated upon a lotus]]
It is believed that Vishnu's association of the lotus is derived from the flower's presence in the symbolism of his consort, [[Lakshmi]], for whom it represented water and fertility. Sculptures of Vishnu bearing a lotus are dated back to the fifth or the sixth century, presenting him with the epithets ''Padmanabha'' (the one with the lotus-navel), ''Pundarikaksha'' (lotus-eyed), and ''Padmapani'' (lotus-handed). Icons of [[Narasimha]] with a lotus growing out of the deity's head have been dated back to the mid-sixth century. On one level, the conch and lotus in Vishnu's hands signify his association with the waters as both a fertilising agent and a cosmic symbol. The [[Panchajanya|conch]] and the lotus are among the most auspicious symbols, and by themselves are often painted on either side of the entrance to a domestic building. The lotus also symbolises the earth and is even said to contain the universe, and hence it is especially appropriate as an emblem for the divine preserver of the universe. The [[Vishnudharmottara Purana|Vishnudharmottara]] specifically states that the lotus emerging from Vishnu's navel symbolises the earth, while the stalk represents the cosmic mountain, [[Meru Peak|Meru]], the axis of the universe. In Vishnu's hand, it symbolises water, and in Lakshmi's hand, wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Art |first1=Los Angeles County Museum of |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=clUmKaWRFTkC&amp;pg=PA41 |title=Indian Sculpture: Circa 500 B.C.-A.D. 700 |last2=Pal |first2=Pratapaditya |date=1986-01-01 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-05991-7 |pages=41 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A piece of the [[Varaha]] avatar of Vishnu and his consort [[Bhumi (goddess)|Bhudevi]] has also been discovered dating back to the third century.

The [[Padma Purana]] is one of the eighteen major [[Puranas]] that is named after the attribute of Vishnu, and contains large sections dedicated to his praise.{{Vaishnavism}}

'''Madhusudana''' ({{lang-sa|मधुसूदन|Madhusūdana|translit-std=IAST}}) is an epithet of [[Vishnu]] and is the 73rd&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/shivkuma/personal/music/vishnu-sahasranamam-meanings.htm Vishnu Sahasranamam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110073014/http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/shivkuma/personal/music/vishnu-sahasranamam-meanings.htm |date=2008-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; name in the [[Vishnu Sahasranama]].

'''Yogamaya''' ({{Lang-sa|योगमाया|lit=illusory potency|translit=Yogamāyā}}), also venerated as '''Vindhyavasini''', '''Mahamaya''', and [[Ekanamsha]], is a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] goddess.

In [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] tradition, she is accorded the epithet '''Narayani''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sinha |first=Purnendu Narayana |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIBBAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=yogamaya+narayani&amp;pg=PA247 |title=A Study of the Bhagavata Purana: Or, Esoteric Hinduism |date=1901 |publisher=Freeman &amp; Company, Limited |pages=247 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Parthasarathy |first1=V.

She is regarded by [[Shaktism|Shaktas]] to be a form of [[Adi Shakti]]. In [[Hindu texts|Hindu literature]], she is born in a [[Yadava]] family, as the daughter of [[Nanda (Hinduism)|Nanda]] and [[Yashoda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Knapp |first=Stephen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eIqyv8A9XBAC&amp;dq=yogamaya+yashoda&amp;pg=PT32 |title=Hindu Gods &amp; Goddesses |date=2012 |publisher=Jaico Publishing House |isbn=978-81-8495-366-4 |pages=32 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Yogamaya refers to “the internal potency of [[Vishnu|Bhagavan]], that arranges and enhances all his pastimes” in the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2017-04-30 |title=Yogamaya, Yogamāyā, Yoga-maya: 13 definitions |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/yogamaya |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goddess Vindhyavasini gets her name from the [[Vindhya Range]], literally meaning, "she who resides in Vindhya".

==Legend==
At the time of the birth of [[Krishna]] as the eighth child of [[Devaki]] and [[Vasudeva]], Yogamaya had been born at the same time at the house of [[Nanda (Hinduism)|Nanda]] and [[Yashoda]], as instructed by [[Vishnu]]. Vasudeva replaced Krishna with this daughter of Yashoda. When [[Kamsa]] tried to kill this infant, believing that she was his prophesied killer, she escaped from the grasp of Kamsa, and turned into her form of [[Durga]]. She informed the tyrant that his killer had already been born elsewhere, and subsequently vanished from the prison of [[Mathura]].
[[File:Episodes Surrounding the Birth of Krishna.jpg|thumb|280x280px|The goddess Yogamaya emerges as Kamsa kills Yashoda's daughter]]
{{blockquote|The child, Yoga-māyā-devī, the younger sister of Lord Viṣṇu, slipped upward from Kaṁsa’s hands and appeared in the sky as Devī, the goddess Durgā, with eight arms, completely equipped with weapons|source=[[Srimad Bhagavatam]], Canto 10,Chapter 4, Verse 9&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/10/4/9/|website=vedabase.io/en/|language=en|access-date=24 February 2020|title=Śb 10.4.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{blockquote|O Kaṁsa, you fool, what will be the use of killing me? The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has been your enemy from the very beginning and who will certainly kill you, has already taken His birth somewhere else.

Thereafter, she is believed by local lore to have chosen to reside at the Vindhyachala mountains, where her temple is located at present. Some believe she was reborn as [[Subhadra]] to help [[Krishna]] for establishing [[dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Krishnan|first=S.

== Shaktism ==
Authors Constance Jones and James D. Ryan opine that Vindhyavasini is mentioned in the [[Devi Mahatmya]], an important text that presents various incarnations or forms of the Supreme Goddess of [[Shaktism]] ([[Mahadevi]]). She is also mentioned in an early 19th-century local text called Vindhya Mahatmya. In both, she is understood to be the Ultimate Reality in its totality. She is also assimilated with [[Parvati]], conceived of as "ultimate divinity".{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=489}}

== Vaishnavism ==
{{Vaishnavism}}
Yogamaya is regarded to be the embodiment of either the internal or the external potency of Vishnu, or his avatar of Krishna, in [[Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Knapp |first=Stephen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eIqyv8A9XBAC&amp;dq=yogamaya+krishna+birth&amp;pg=PT32 |title=Hindu Gods &amp; Goddesses |date=2012 |publisher=Jaico Publishing House |isbn=978-81-8495-366-4 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess, also referred to as ''Vaishnavi Mahamaya'', assumes a number of manifestations like [[Durga]], Ambika, Kshemada, and [[Bhadrakali]], according to the [[Vishnu Purana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Varadpande |first=Manohar Laxman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_XrFh2S8nlEC&amp;dq=yogamaya+power+vishnu&amp;pg=PA15 |title=Mythology of Vishnu and His Incarnations |date=2009 |publisher=Gyan Publishing House |isbn=978-81-212-1016-4 |pages=15 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Bhagavata Purana, the asura [[Hiranyaksha]] mocks [[Varaha]] and references Vishnu's ''Yogamaya'':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2022-07-24 |title=Hiraṇyākṣa's Fight with Varāha [Chapter 18] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-bhagavata-purana/d/doc1127066.html |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Blockquote|text=Are you employed by our enemies for destroying us? You kill Asuras by Māyā and thus conquer them by fraudulent means. Oh dunce, I shall wipe out the sorrows of my friends by killing you, whose strength lies in yoga-māyā, but have little personal bravery.|title=[[Bhagavata Purana]]|source=Chapter 18}}

According to a 17th century literary poem called the ''Mukundavilasa'', when [[Bhumi (goddess)|Bhudevi]] and [[Brahma]] petition Vishnu to intervene in earthly affairs due to the oppression of [[Kamsa]] and [[Shishupala]], he recruits a number of deities to assist him in his Krishna avatar: [[Lakshmi]] is to be born as [[Rukmini]], Bhudevi is to manifest as [[Satyabhama]], [[Shesha]] is to incarnate as [[Balarama]], and Yogamaya is tasked to be born as the daughter of Yashoda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Unni |first=N.

In the narratives of Krishna, the deity employs the phenomenon of ''Yogamaya'' in order to spend time with the cowherd women of [[Gokul]]am, the [[gopi]]s. During his blissful dalliance with the gopis, it is Yogamaya who creates spiritual doppelgangers of each gopi at their houses so that they can also act as chaste wives to their husbands, while also dwelling on the deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schweig |first=Graham M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k4ZeDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=yogamaya+potency&amp;pg=PA130 |title=Dance of Divine Love: India's Classic Sacred Love Story: The Rasa Lila of Krishna |date=2018-06-26 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-19017-4 |pages=136 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], when [[Arjuna]] wonders why Krishna's pastimes and true form are not visible to mortals, he responds by stating that his manifestations are not visible to all men, and that he is veiled by his illusory potency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2020-05-08 |title=Verse 7.25 [Bhagavad-gita] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/shrimad-bhagavad-gita/d/doc419992.html |access-date=2022-09-28 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[asura]] [[Jalandhara]] wages a war against [[Shiva]] to abduct [[Parvati]], Vishnu employs Yogamaya to employ an illusion to maintain his presence at [[Vaikuntha]] for the sake of his wife, [[Lakshmi]], and slyly claims the chastity of the asura's wife, [[Tulasi in Hinduism|Vrinda]]. This allows Shiva to prevail in his war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pintchman |first=Tracy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KcEotmV2MAC&amp;dq=yogamaya+goddess+lakshmi&amp;pg=PA81 |title=Guests at God's Wedding: Celebrating Kartik among the Women of Benares |date=2005-08-25 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-6595-0 |pages=81 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Yogamaya's service to Vishnu, the deity offers her the occasion of ''[[Vaikuntha Ekadashi|Ekadashi]]'' (the eleventh day of every month) for veneration in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rinehart |first=Robin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMPYnfS_R90C&amp;dq=yogamaya+vishnu&amp;pg=PA142 |title=Contemporary Hinduism: Ritual, Culture, and Practice |date=2004 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-57607-905-8 |pages=142 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], the first [[guru]] of the [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]] is '''Sri Hansa Bhagwan''', who is regarded one of the twenty-four incarnations of [[Vishnu]] within the tradition. At the beginning of creation, in the Satya Yuga, Vishnu Himself took the form of a quadrangle, joined conch shells, chakras, maces, and lotuses, and descended to the sage Sankadi, the son of [[Brahma]], in the name of Hansabata.

It is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam that Brahma created his own Manasputra, Sanak, Sananda, Sanatkumar and Sanatan, and advised them to spread the people. But they were reluctant to indulge in worldly affairs, so they sought advice from Father Brahma to get rid of this worldly world. Father Brahma was then overwhelmed by the powerful menstrual cycle as he was busy with the work of creation, so he was unable to advise the Sankadi sages on theology. Then he meditated on Vishnu and called him for this deed. Srivagavan then descended in the form of a swan and sent the Sankadi sages on the path of liberation by advising them on theology.

== Uddhav Bani in Lord Krishna Srimad-Bhagavatam == 
Tasyahang hansarupena sakasamagamanga then. (Srimadbhagavatam, 11.13.19)
 
That is - then I came to him in the form of a swan. Lord Krishna said again -
 
Janit magatang yajnang yusmaddharmaribakshaya. (Srimadbhagavatam, 11.13.38)
 
That is, come to know me as Vishnu, who came in the form of a swan to preach your religion (Sankadi sage is called the swan god).
 
Mention of the Bhagavad-gita in the true age is found elsewhere in Srimad-Bhagavatam.
 
Krite shuklachaturbahurjatilo balkalambarah.
 
Krishnajinopabitakshan bibraddanda kamandalu.
 
Hansah suparno baikuntho dharmo yogeshvaromal.
 
Ishwar: Purusho: Vyakta: Paramatmeti Giyate. (Srimadbhagavatam, 11.5.21,23)
 
That is to say - in the Satya Yuga, Srivagavan became white-colored, quadrangular, braided, clothed, clothed in black, deer-skinned, upavita, aksamala and danda, and kamandalu. In that true age, Srivagavan became known as Hansa, Suparna, Vaikuntha, Ishvara, Purusha, Abyakta, and Paramatma.
Gopal Sahasranama and Vishnu Sahasranama hymns also mention a name of Srivagavan as "Hansa". E.g. -
 
Achyutah Keshabo Vishnurhari: Satyo Janardanah.
 
Hanso Narayano Lilo Nilo Bhakti Parayanah. (Gopal Sahasranam, 65)
 
Maricirdamano hansah suparno bhujagottamah.
 
Hiranyanabha: Sutapa: Padmanabha: Butterfly. (Vishnu Sahasranama, 21)
 
The meaning of the word hansa is - hanso, like kshtirnibibechane sakstastatha: sau sarvajnyadyanantagunashaktyadimatben janjanjmadibyaparakartattrva-chchetanachetanyorbibechananipunyabaniti. (Mantrahasyatika)

Just as a goose is able to understand the difference between milk and water, so is this goose who has omniscient and eternal qualities and is the master of the creation of the worldSimply put - just as a swan renounces water from a mixture of milk and water and accepts fertilizer milk, so does a goose separate the external vain unconscious world from the soul involved in the subject and the sensory world by accepting the fertilized soul as its inner consciousnessAble to give advice of self-knowledge.There is another interpretation of the word hansa - hantiti hansa (hanti iti hansa). When the word "hanti" means to kill or destroy, the word hans means - "soham" meaning - "I am that".
 
The swan, the incarnation of Vishnu, descended in the Satya Yuga and gave the Sankadi sages the liberating theology and took the place of the first and eternal Sadguru in our community.

== Hamsa Gita == 
The Swan Gita (Sanskrit) (also known as Uddhav Gita) consists of Krishna's final speech to Uddhav before he finishes his earthly 'Avataran' (Sanskrit: अवतार) and 'Entertainment' (Sanskrit: लीला). Although the Uddhav Gita is often published as a solo work, it is also found in the eleventh canto of the Bhagavata Purana that sections 40 to 8 begin at the end, containing more than 1000 verses (Sanskrit: शलोक) and as part of the Puranas. Is considered.The discourse contains a story of Avadhuta and although the name of this personality is not explicitly mentioned in the Bhagavata Purana as a whole, the Vaishnava tradition and the larger traditional religion describe this agency as Dattatreya.

== Manuscripts and texts == 
The names Uddhav Gita and Hamsa Gita are popularly interchangeable but the Hamsa Gita also specifically refers to a subset of the Uddhav Gita and the Bhagavata Purana.

== Naming, theory and etymology == 
Hamsa Gita (Sanskrit) (also referred to as Uddhav Gita) where Hamsa is a metaphor for Paramahamsa and at the same time a natural teacher of clear mercy in nature. Hamsa (hansa in Sanskrit and often written) is a swan or duck, often considered a silent swan, but really a bar-headed duck. It is used as a symbol and a decorative element in Indian culture. 'Git' (literally the word "song" in Sanskrit; Devanagari).

== English speech == 
Tigunite (2002: pp.&amp;nbsp;39–45) In the Uddhav Gita, Dattatreya translated the narrations of 24 teachers into English. Although scholars agree that the Bhagavata Purana is a composite work of many oral traditions, the Vaishnava tradition and the Bhagavata Purana itself believe that it was written by Vyasadeva. It is said that the narrator of the Hamsa Gita is Rishi Shuka, the son of Byas Deva. It is important to note that although the work is composite, it does not show a "... lack of coordination or compactness that should identify the work performed by many authors ...""Forward to Brown and Saraswati" (20: p.&amp;nbsp;8) and then Upadhyay further states that whatever the poet of the Hamsa Gita and Bhagavata Purana, he is a poet who uses patterns and metaphors in a complex work of art. Haig (2006: p.&amp;nbsp;128) framed his import as a model of environmental education in the opening paragraph of his work on the Uddhav Gita:
 
Sri Dattatreya, who is quoted in the Lord Krishna Uddhav Gita, has emerged as a guru for environmental education. Sri Dattatreya gained knowledge by observing the world, which was given to him by twenty-four instructors. These taught him the futility of spiritual addiction, the benefits of thought and tolerance, and a path to the highest spiritual self-realization. Sri Dattatreya, the incarnation of Vishnu, is featured in several Puranas where his teachings involve a direct challenge to students ’tendencies and superstitions. Its main message is “never judge by the appearance of the surface but always seek a deeper truth”: the world is sacred, an aspect of God, and a puzzle that challenges the spiritual soul to awaken to its true nature.
 
Paramahansa (2006: Apaginakara) organizes a Swedish Gita literature under the supervision of Srimad Bhagavatam and maintains that these are all songs of Manizism:
 
"The Gita in Srimad Bhagavatam proposes Uddhav-Gita, Rudra-Gita, Bhikshu-Gita, Shruti-Gita, Hamsa-Gita Manizm as the essence of their philosophy.
 
Upadhyaya, Forward to Brown and Saraswati (20: p.&amp;nbsp;6) thinks that Saraswati (this is Ambikananda) who herself is a monk and has taken this ashram from a very young age, writes as follows:
 
Swami Ambikananda's success in transforming his work into a metric composition is a tribute to the versatility of Sanskrit and the clarity of the original writing. His translation method is characterized by two considerations. He sought to find close equivalents, keeping in mind both the formal and dynamic aspects of language; And the purpose of his explanatory translation is to point out the complete naturalness of the expression, the way the reader behaves in the context of his own culture.
 
Brown and Saraswati (20: p.&amp;nbsp;14) think that Venkatesananda (1921–1972) and his guru Shivananda (18-1983) opened their hearts to this work:
 
Swami Shivananda and Swami Venkatesananda opened my heart to this sacred book, and their teachings enabled me to translate it, trying to convey its message to all spiritual saints.

'''''Caturvyūha'''''  or '''''Chatur-vyūha''''' ({{Lang-sa|चतुर्व्यूह|lit=four emanations|translit=Caturvyūha}}), is an ancient Indian religious concept initially focusing on the four earthly emanations ([[Vyūha]]s) of the Supreme deity [[Nārāyaṇa]],&lt;ref name="DS209"/&gt; and later [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name="US439"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Upinder |title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century |date=2008 |publisher=Pearson Education India |isbn=978-81-317-1677-9 |page=439 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pq2iCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA439 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these emanations is the hero-god [[Vāsudeva]], with the other emanations being his kinsmen presented as extensions of Vāsudeva himself.&lt;ref name="DS209"/&gt; From around the 1st century CE, this "Vyuha doctrine" (''Vyūhavāda'') developed out of the earlier ''Vīravāda'' cult of the [[Vrishni heroes]], in which the five heroes [[Saṃkarṣaṇa]], [[Vāsudeva]], [[Pradyumna]], [[Samba (Krishna's son)|Samba]] and [[Aniruddha]] had remained mostly human in character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Indian History |date=1988 |publisher=Allied Publishers |isbn=978-81-8424-568-4 |page=A222 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MazdaWXQFuQC&amp;pg=SL1-PA222 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still later, around the 4th century CE, it evolved into the ''Avatāravāda'' system of incarnations of [[Vishnu]], in which Vishnu was the primordial being and the Vrishni heroes had become his avatars.&lt;ref name="JS73"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shaw |first1=Julia |title=Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, c.

==Concept and evolution==
The four earthly emanations, or ''"[[Vyuha]]s"'', are identified as [[Samkarshana]] ([[Balarama]]-Samkarshana, son of [[Vasudeva]] by[[ Devaki]]),&lt;ref name="US437"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Upinder |title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century |date=2008 |publisher=Pearson Education India |isbn=978-81-317-1120-0 |pages=436–438 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA437 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jgw127"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joanna Gottfried Williams|title=Kalādarśana: American Studies in the Art of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-qoeAAAAIAAJ |year=1981|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-06498-2|pages=127–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vāsudeva]] krishna (son of [[Vasudeva]] by [[Devaki]]),&lt;ref name="US437"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jgw127"/&gt; [[Pradyumna]] (son of Vasudeva Krishna by [[Rukmini]]),&lt;ref name="US437" /&gt; and [[Aniruddha]] (son of Pradyumna).&lt;ref name="US436"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Upinder |title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century |date=2008 |publisher=Pearson Education India |isbn=978-81-317-1120-0 |pages=436–440 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA436 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Joanna Gottfried |title=Kalādarśana: American Studies in the Art of India |date=1981 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-06498-0 |page=129 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-qoeAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA129 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are probably similar the legendary [[Vrishni heroes]] of the [[Mathura]] region, minus [[Samba (Krishna's son)|Samba]] (son of Vasudeva by [[Jambavati]]).&lt;ref name="US437"/&gt;

Originally, several of these earthly deities, particularly [[Vāsudeva]], seem to have formed one of several major independent cults, together with the cults of [[Narayana]], [[Shri]], and [[Lakshmi]], before they later coalesced to form [[Vishnuism]].&lt;ref name="US"/&gt; The actual cult of [[Vishnu]] only developed after these initial cults were established.&lt;ref name="US"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Upinder |title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century |date=2008 |publisher=Pearson Education India |isbn=978-81-317-1120-0 |page=436 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA436 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heroes would then have evolved into Vaishnavite deities through a step-by-step process: 1) deification of the Vrishni heroes 2) association with the God [[Narayana]]-[[Vishnu]] 3) incorporation into the [[Vyuha]] concept of successive emanations of the God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Srinivasan |first1=Doris |title=Early Vaiṣṇava Imagery: Caturvyūha and Variant Forms |journal=Archives of Asian Art |date=1979 |volume=32 |page=50 |jstor=20111096 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigraphically, the deified status of Vāsudeva in particular is confirmed by his appearance on the coinage of [[Agathocles of Bactria]] (190-180 BCE) and by the devotional character of the [[Heliodorus pillar]] inscription (circa 110 BCE).&lt;ref name="DS51"/&gt; Later, the association with [[Narayana]] ([[Vishnu]]) is suggested by the [[Hathibada Ghosundi Inscriptions]] of the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref name="DS51"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Srinivasan |first1=Doris |title=Early Vaiṣṇava Imagery: Caturvyūha and Variant Forms |journal=Archives of Asian Art |date=1979 |volume=32 |page=51 |jstor=20111096 |issn=0066-6637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kushan Caturvyuha (2nd century BCE)==
By the 2nd century CE, the "''avatara'' concept was in its infancy", and the depiction of Vishnu with his four emanations (the ''Chatur-vyūha''), consisting in the Vrishni heroes minus Samba, starts to become visible in art at the end of the [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] period.&lt;ref name="US439"/&gt; Starting with the [[art of Mathura]], Vāsudeva (avatar of [[Vishnu]]) fittingly appears in the center of the sculptural compositions, with his decorated heavy mace on the side and a conch shell in the hand, his elder brother [[Balarama]] to his right under a serpent hood and holding a drinking cup, his son [[Pradyumna]] to his left, and his grandson [[Aniruddha]] on top.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

==Possible Bhita Caturvyuha (2nd century BCE)==
[[File:Bhita Caturvyuha Lucknow Museum.jpg|thumb|The Bhita statue in the [[Lucknow Museum]], with four characters standing around a central axis, has also been proposed as a ''Caturvyuha'',.&lt;ref name="DS39"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Srinivasan |first1=Doris |title=Early Vaiṣṇava Imagery: Caturvyūha and Variant Forms |journal=Archives of Asian Art |date=1979 |volume=32 |pages=39–54 |jstor=20111096 |issn=0066-6637}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasudeva is standing at the front, and the seated lion, symbol of [[Samkarsana]], is visible on the left.]]
An ancient statue from [[Bhita]] near [[Allahabad]] ({{coord|25.308|81.794|display=inline}}), with four figures facing in four directions, now in the [[Lucknow Museum]], has been proposed to represent the ''Caturvyuha'' concept,&lt;ref name="DS39"/&gt; although interpretations vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harle |first1=James C. |title=The Art and Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent |date=1994 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-06217-5 |page=490, note 34 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwcBVvdqyBkC&amp;pg=PA490 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dated to the 2nd century BCE on stylistic grounds, being quite similar in style to the monumental [[Yaksha]] statues.&lt;ref name="DS39"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Joshi |first1=N. P. |title=Some Unnoticed Finds of Iconographic Interest |journal=East and West |date=1972 |volume=22 |issue=1/2 |pages=41–49 |jstor=29755743 |issn=0012-8376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main figure is bigger than the others, wears a crown and earrings, as well as an ornate necklace and bracelets, and raises his hand in "[[mudra|abahaya mudra]]", a symbol of deification, and holds jar in the left hand.&lt;ref name="DS39"/&gt; The figure would be [[Vāsudeva]].&lt;ref name="DS39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DS209"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Srinivasan |first1=Doris |title=Many Heads, Arms, and Eyes: Origin, Meaning, and Form of Multiplicity in Indian Art |date=1997 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-10758-8 |pages=209–210 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZheP9dIX9wC&amp;pg=PA209 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the proper right side of the crowned figure appears an unidentifiable face, and below it a seated lion.&lt;ref name="DS39"/&gt; This part could identified with [[Samkarsana]], combining anthropomorphic and [[theriomorphic]] characteristics, and later associated with [[Narasimha]].&lt;ref name="DS39"/&gt; On the proper left side of the crowned figure also appears an unidentifiable face, and below it a boar on a pedestal, standing on its hind legs, with the front legs joint in the ''[[namaskara|namaskāra]]'' gesture of prayer and devotion.&lt;ref name="DS39"/&gt; This could be [[Aniruddha]], later identified with [[Varaha]].&lt;ref name="DS39"/&gt; The figure on the reverse is devoid of ornamentation, the hair is parted in the middle and falls loosely, but both arms are broken, making it impossible to identify their attributes.&lt;ref name="DS39"/&gt; This could be [[Pradyumna]], later associated with [[Rudra]] and the fierce-looking Kāpila.&lt;ref name="DS39"/&gt;

This sculpture of the Caturvyuha shows the Vrishni heroes, but already associates them with their animal form.&lt;ref name="DS39"/&gt; This seems to prefigure the [[Vaikuntha Chaturmurti|Vishnu Chaturmurti]], in which [[Vishnu]], crowned with a halo, is also flanked by the images of [[Narasimha]] and [[Varaha]], with [[Kāpila]] in back as seens in the examples from [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref name="DS39"/&gt;

The general style of the figures is quite similar to that of the early [[Yaksha]]s, and it has been suggested that their role might have been understood as parallel: just as the Yakshas are considered as emanations of the Supreme deity [[Brahman]], the four Vyuhas are similarly emanations of [[Narayana]].&lt;ref name="DS209"/&gt;

'''''Kalki''''' is a 1978 [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|pre/post-apocalyptic]] novel by American author [[Gore Vidal]].

''Kalki'' is narrated by Theodora (Teddy) Ottinger, a [[Southern California]]n [[aviator]] ("aviatrix" in the text) and author, who, after publishing a book called ''Beyond Motherhood'', comes to the attention of Kalki, the leader of a [[Kathmandu]]-based religious cult. The cult secretly makes its money through selling drugs and then gives it away using ''lotus lotteries''. Kalki claims to be God, as well as the final [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], who is going to end the [[human race]] on April 3. The planet will then be rid of the wicked and a fresh, clean start will usher in a new [[golden age]]. Ottinger suspects that Kalki will create a worldwide nuclear chain reaction which will annihilate every living thing and leave the planet uninhabitable. When the threatened apocalypse does occur, however, it does not take the form which Ottinger had feared, and only the human species succumbs to extinction.

The novel covers many cultural and political topics such as [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[birth control]], [[bisexuality]] and [[feminism]].

==Plot summary==
James J. Kelly, a former soldier in the American military, finds out that the American and Soviet governments are about to conduct tests of a new kind of [[neutron bomb]] called the ''model b'' or the nC, which will kill every living thing on the planet, leaving it uninhabitable for centuries. The American generals know the cataclysmic effects of conducting these tests but they acquiesce to the tests anyway, ignoring a report provided to the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] which predicts the end of the world if six or more nCs are simultaneously exploded. Mistakenly assured that the Soviets would not explode reciprocating nCs, the generals are unwittingly about to destroy the whole world.

Kelly decides to save the human race through an elaborate religious hoax, declaring himself to be [[Kalki]] and announcing the end of the world. His secret plan is to kill off everyone in the world except for himself and his wife Lakshmi. They would become the Adam and Eve to a new human race by giving birth to three sons and six daughters over the next twelve years, who would then intermarry; in approximately two centuries the world would be fairly well populated again.

In addition to himself and his wife, Kalki decides to bring along three more people to his new world, teachers called Perfect Masters, chosen for their knowledge and the fact that they are all [[Infertility|sterile]]. These three people will teach various fields of science to the new race. Teddy Ottinger will teach engineering, Geraldine O'Connor biology and genetics, and Dr. Giles Lowell medicine. Kalki's wife Lakshmi is herself a physicist, and Kalki is a chemical engineer.

Kalki succeeds in carrying out his plan and the entire world dies, leaving behind only Kalki, his wife Lakshmi and the three other Perfect Masters.  However, Kalki's plans go awry when Lakshmi miscarries the first baby girl and it is learnt that Lakshmi is incapable of having children with Kalki. At this point, the only other male in the group, Dr. Lowell, announces that he never had a [[vasectomy]] and is the only one now with whom Lakshmi can conceive a child. It had been his plan all along to be the one to father the new human race with Lakshmi, whom he claims to be in love with. When Dr. Lowell admits his treachery, Kalki kills him.

The story ends with a postscript from Kelly/Kalki, 43 years after the apocalyptic plague. In the interim period, Teddy died 27 years after the plague and Geraldine (Teddy's lover and Kalki's second consort) died, as has Lakshmi. Kalki has become the last human alive, and with his death, the human species will become extinct. It is implied that [[simian]]s will inherit the post-apocalyptic world.

==Characters ==
;The five Perfect Masters
*Kalki, formerly James J. Kelly – Ex-US Army chemical-warfare chemist and purported 10th reincarnation of the god [[Vishnu]]; eventual last human survivor.
*Lakshmi, formerly Doris Pannicker – Nuclear physicist and reincarnation of Vishnu's wife.
*Dr. Giles Lowell (also CIA agent Dr. Ashok in disguise) – Medical doctor and avatar of [[Ravana]].

==Reception==
''Kalki'' was a finalist for the 1978 [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]].&lt;ref name=SFWA&gt;[https://nebulas.sfwa.org/nominated-work/kalki/ Kalki], at [[Science Fiction Writers of America]]; retrieved July 23, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]] gave ''Kalki'' a mixed review, saying that while the story is initially entertaining, "an icy wind blows throughout the novel, and when all is said and done that wind has blasted the characters and plot of ''Kalki'' into just so many opinions ... By the end, it doesn't seem like fiction at all that we're reading, but just another clever dissertation by Gore Vidal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:RRP0qPQmcJIJ:www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/01/home/vidal-kalki.html Kalki]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' book review, 30 March 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' critic R. Z. Sheppard took a more favorable view, finding the novel "an amusing, brittle tissue of truths culled largely from the journalistic sources Vidal enjoys satirizing." He described ''Kalki'' as "an apocalyptical extravaganza that craftily combines feminism, homosexuality, mysticism, science fiction, fiction science, the [[second law of thermodynamics]], the first law of survival, high fashion and low animal cunning" and its plot as "diabolically clever."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101014113155/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916044,00.html Elegant Hell]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' book review, 27 May 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orson Scott Card]], writing expressly from a genre perspective, faulted Vidal's narrator as "intensely boring," but praised the apocalyptic conclusion: "Kalki left me with the haunting feeling that there was something grateful about four billion people leaving life suddenly, without panic, without a chance to soil their last moments with repentance or greed."&lt;ref&gt;"Other Voices," ''Science Fiction Review'', November 1978, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;
