The '''Vasus''' ({{Lang-sa|वसु|translit=Vasu}}) refers to a group of deities in [[Hinduism]] associated with fire and light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dalal |first=Roshen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrk0AwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=eight+vasus&amp;pg=PT1333 |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |date=2014-04-18 |publisher=Penguin UK |isbn=978-81-8475-277-9 |pages=1333 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are described to be the attendant deities of [[Indra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Coulter |first1=Charles Russell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QEJUEAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=vasus+attendants+vishnu&amp;pg=PA493 |title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities |last2=Turner |first2=Patricia |date=2021-12-06 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-9179-7 |pages=493 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Achuthananda |first=Swami |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F9FqDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=vasus+attendants+vishnu&amp;pg=PA65 |title=The Ascent of Vishnu and the Fall of Brahma |date=2018-08-27 |publisher=Relianz Communications Pty Ltd |isbn=978-0-9757883-3-2 |pages=65 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally numbering eight and classified as the '''Ashtavasu''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Balfour |first=Edward |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XCE_AQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=eight+ashtavasu&amp;pg=PA182 |title=The Cyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia: Commercial, Industrial and Scientific, Products of the Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal Kingdoms, Useful Arts and Manufactures |date=1885 |publisher=B. Quartitch |pages=182 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are described in the [[Ramayana]] as the children of [[Kashyapa]] and [[Aditi]], and in the [[Mahabharata]] as the sons of [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] or [[Yama (Hinduism)|Dharma]] and a daughter of [[Daksha]] named Vasu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hopkins |first=Edward Washburn |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-H0eiuvcG5IC&amp;dq=vasus+manu&amp;pg=PA170 |title=Epic Mythology |date=June 1968 |publisher=Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers |isbn=978-0-8196-0228-2 |pages=170 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are eight among the [[thirty-three gods]] featured in the [[Vedas]].

== Etymology ==
The Sanskrit term ''Vasu''(s) is translated as the "bright ones".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hardwick |first=Charles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JufyDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=vasus+bright&amp;pg=PA279 |title=Traditions, Ssuperstitions, and Folk-Lore |date=2020-07-24 |publisher=BoD – Books on Demand |isbn=978-3-7523-3244-5 |pages=279 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List==
There are varying lists of the eight Vasus in different texts, sometimes only because particular deities have varying names. The following are names and meanings according to the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], Manava Purana, and according to the [[Mahabharata]], as normally equated:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sutton |first=Komilla |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTMkDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=ashta+vasus&amp;pg=PT212 |title=Nakshatras: The Stars Beyond the Zodiac |date=2014-05-01 |publisher=The Wessex Astrologer |isbn=978-1-902405-97-1 |pages=212 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' uses the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|Brhad-Aranyaka]]'' names, most later texts follow the ''Mahabharata'' names with the exception that [[Ap (water)|Āpa]] 'water' usually appears in place of Aha. The [[Vishnu Purana]] equates Prabhāsa with the lights of the  27 Nakshatras (Constellations/Lunar Mansions) and Dhruva with Akasha, that is "space", Dhruva seemingly taking over Aha's role when Aha is replaced by Āpa.

==Legend==
[[File:The wife of one of the vasus is tempted to steal the wish-bearing cow.jpg|thumb|The wife of one of the Vasus is tempted to steal the wish-bearing cow|260x260px]]
In the ''[[Ramayana]]'' the Vasus are children of [[Aditi]] and [[Kashyapa]].

The [[Mahabharata]] relates how the Vasus, led by "Prithu" (presumably here a male form of [[Prithvi]]), were enjoying themselves in the forest, when the wife of Prabhasa (also referred to as Dyaus) spotted [[Kamadhenu|an excellent cow]] and persuaded her husband Prabhasa to steal it,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Buitenen |first1=Johannes Adrianus Bernardus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i8oe5fY5_3UC&amp;dq=vasus+wife+cow&amp;pg=PA221 |title=The Mahabharata, Volume 1: Book 1: The Book of the Beginning |last2=Buitenen |first2=J.

Unfortunately for the Vasus, the cow was owned by the sage [[Vashishta]] who learned through his ascetic powers that the Vasus had stolen it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Doniger |first1=Wendy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sktbYRG_LO8C&amp;dq=vasus+wife+cow&amp;pg=PA332 |title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology |last2=O'Flaherty |first2=Wendy Doniger |date=1988 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=978-81-208-0386-2 |pages=332 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He immediately cursed them to be born on earth as mortals. Vashishta responded to pleading by the Vasus by promising that seven of them would be free of earthly life within a year of being born and that only Prabhasa would pay the full penalty. The Vasus then requested the river-goddess [[Ganga in Hinduism|Ganga]] to be their mother. Ganga incarnated and became the wife of King [[Shantanu]] on condition that he never gainsaid her in any way. As seven children were born, one after the other, Ganga drowned them in her own waters, freeing them from their punishment and the king made no opposition. Only when the eighth was born did the king finally oppose his wife, who therefore left him. So the eighth son, Prabhasa incarnated, remained alive, imprisoned in mortal form, and later became known in his mortal incarnation as [[Bhishma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Raman |first=Gowri |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDvqDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=ashta+vasus&amp;pg=PA3 |title=Mahabharatha |date=2020-06-09 |publisher=Blue Rose Publishers |pages=3 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Ray |first1=Himanshu Prabha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5eSEAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=vasus+ganga&amp;pg=PT182 |title=The Routledge Handbook of Hindu Temples: Materiality, Social History and Practice |last2=Kulshreshtha |first2=Salila |last3=Suvrathan |first3=Uthara |date=2022-10-13 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-1-000-78581-4 |pages=182 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vasu'' is also the name of the eighth ''chakra'' (group) of ''[[Melakarta]]'' [[raga]]s in [[Carnatic music]]. The names of ''chakras'' are based on the numbers associated with each name. In this case, there are 8 ''Vasus'' and hence the eighth ''chakra'' is ''Vasu''.&lt;ref name="sim"&gt;''South Indian Music'' Book III, by Prof. P Sambamoorthy, Published 1973, The Indian Music Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ragas"&gt;''Ragas in Carnatic music'' by Dr. S.

{{good article}}
'''Ayudhapurusha''' is the [[anthropomorphic]] depiction of a divine weapon in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art. Ayudhapurushas are sometimes considered as partial incarnates of their divine owners.&lt;ref name="anna"&gt;Anna L. Dallapiccola, [http://www.credoreference.com/entry/thhll/ayudhapurusha_or_shastradevata ayudhapurusha or shastradevata]. (2002). In ''Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend, Thames &amp; Hudson''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sex of the personified weapon is determined by the gender of the weapon in the [[Sanskrit language]].&lt;ref name="anna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rao288"&gt;Rao p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; The suffix "purusha" (man) is added to masculine weapons and "devi" (goddess) to female ones.&lt;ref name="anna"/&gt; The weapons [[Shakti]], Heti (a Hatchet-like weapon) and [[Gada (weapon)|Gada]] (mace), especially [[Kaumodaki]] (the mace of Vishnu), Dhanus/Dhanushya ("bow") are women. [[Chakram|Chakra]], especially Vishnu's [[Sudarshana Chakra]] (discus of Vishnu), [[Shankha]] ("conch"), [[Padma (attribute)|Padma]] (lotus), [[Ankusha]] (elephant goad), [[Pasha (Hinduism)|Pasha]] (noose), [[Trisula]] (trident), [[vajra]] (thunderbolt), Khadga (sword), [[Danda]] (a sceptre or club), Bana/Shara ("arrow") and Bhindi (sling) are depicted male.&lt;ref name="Rao288"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rao289ff"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "varadpande"/&gt;

While weapons are personified in ancient [[Hindu epic]]s like the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the ayudhapurushas were depicted in sculpture starting from the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] era. They might be depicted as humans with the weapons against them or holding the weapon or with the weapon on their head or emerging from it. The most popular ayudhapurushas are associated with the god [[Vishnu]] and appear in his iconography.

==Textual references==
The first instance, where weapons are personified in Hindu scriptures, appears in the [[Hindu epic]] ''[[Ramayana]]''. Two daughters of the ''[[Prajapati]]'' [[Daksha]], Jaya and Vijaya are married to the sage Krisasva. For destruction of [[Rakshasas]], Jaya bore fifty sons - powerful divine weapons who could take any form. Suprabha gave birth to fifty invincible sons who were called ''Samhara''s ("destroyers"). These magical weapons were known as ''Shastra-devatas'' – the gods of weapons - and were given to king Kaushika, who later became the sage [[Vishwamitra]]. The weapons served him and later his pupil [[Rama]], an [[avatar]] of Vishnu.&lt;ref name = "varadpande"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Robert P.|title=The Ramayana Of Valmiki: Balakanda|series=The Ramayana Of Valmiki: An Epic Of Ancient India|volume=1|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-01485-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/ramayanaofva01valm/page/166 166]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ramayanaofva01valm/page/166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' records at the time of the chakra-musala war, the weapons of [[Krishna]] – another avatar of Vishnu and his brother [[Balarama]] appear in human form from the heavens to watch the battle. They include Krishna's Sudarshana Chakra and Kaumodaki, and Balarama's Samvartak plough and Saunanda musala (club). The ''Duta-Vakya'' ("envoy's message") of the Sanskrit playwright [[Bhasa]] (c. 2nd century BCE – 2nd century CE) describes an episode from the ''Mahabharata'' when Krishna goes as an envoy to [[Kauravas]]' court to broker peace between them and their cousins the [[Pandavas]], on behalf of the latter. However, when the Kauravas try to arrest Krishna, Krishna assumes his ''[[Vishvarupa]]'' (all pervading "Universal form") and summons his weapons, who appear as humans. The ayudhapurushas include the Sudarshana Chakra, the bow Saranga, Kaumodaki, [[Panchajanya]] the conch and [[Nandaka]] the sword, elaborate descriptions of whom are found in the text. This is the only Sanskrit play that depicts the weapons on stage as humans. The ''[[Raghuvamsa]]'' of [[Kalidasa]] mentions about dwarf-like ayudhapurushas denoting Vishnu's chakra, lotus, sword, bow and mace.&lt;ref name = "varadpande"&gt;{{cite book|last=Varadpande|first=Manohar Laxman |title=History of Indian theatre|year=2005|pages=48–9|isbn=81-7017-430-9|publisher = Abhinav Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual descriptions==
[[File:Chakra ayudhapurusha.jpg|thumb|Sudarshana Chakra depicted as an ayudhapurusha and fierce aspect of his owner Vishnu.]]

Treatises such as the ''[[Vishnudharmottara Purana]]'' and various [[Agama (Hinduism)|''Agama''s]] describe the iconography of the ayudhapurushas. Shakti is depicted as a red-hued woman seated on a wolf. The Danda is a fearful black-complexioned man with wrathful red eyes. The Khadga is also a dark and angry man. Pasha is depicted as a male snake with seven hoods. Dhvaja ("banner") is a yellow-coloured strong man with his mouth wide open. The Trishula is a handsome black-complexioned man with lovely eyebrows. The Shankha is described as a white male with adorable eyes. The Bana (arrow) is a red-coloured man with beautiful eyes, however the ''Vaikhaashagama'' describes it to be a black-complexioned eunuch with three eyes, dressed in white clothes and riding on the wind. The Dhanus (bow) is a red lotus coloured female with a stringed bow on her head. The ''Vishnudharmottara Purana'' describes Chakra as man with a fat belly and round eyes, decorated with various ornaments and holding a ''[[chamara]]'' (chowry) and with Vishnu's left hand on his head. The slim-waisted woman Gada holds a chowry in her hands and is adored with ornaments, with Vishnu's right hand resting on her head.&lt;ref name="Rao289ff"&gt;Rao pp. 289–90&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Sudarshana Chakra is depicted as a subordinate figure with Vishnu, in many South Indian Vishnu temples, the Chakra as an ayudhapurusha is worshipped in its own shrine attached to the central temple. Here, the Chakra is regarded as an aspect of Vishnu and called ''Chakra-rupi Vishnu'' – Vishnu in the form of the Chakra. In the outline of the ordinary circular Chakra with a hexagram inscribed in it (''shat-kona-chakra'') – stands the personified Chakra in fierce form generally with eight arms. Often, [[Narasimha|Yoga-Narasimha]], the lion-man ferocious aspect of Vishnu is depicted on the back of the Chakra sculpture. The ''[[Shilparatna]]'' describes that the fierce Chakra-rupi Vishnu should hold in his hands gada, chakra, a snake, a lotus, ''musala'' (a pestle), ''tramsha'', pasha and ankusha. He is depicted as radiant as the sun and with protruding tusks from the sides of his mouth. Another description describes the Chakra as a sixteen-armed fierce form of Vishnu. He holds a chakra, shankha, bow, parashu, asi (sword), arrow, trishula, pasha, ankusha, agni (fire), khadga (sword), shield, hala (plough), musala, gada and kunta. Three-eyed and golden-coloured with protruding tusks, the Chakra stands in the ''shat-kona-chakra'', with Narasimha on the reverse of the sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Rao pp. 290–2&lt;/ref&gt;

An ayudhapurusha is generally depicted as a two-armed figure, prescribed to shown with a karanda mukuta (conical crown).&lt;ref name="anna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rao288"/&gt; An ayudhapurusha may be depicted as a dwarf, concurring with Kalidasa's description in the ''Raghuvamsa''. Such icons are present in [[Rajgir]], [[Mahabalipuram]] and [[Badami]]. They may be depicted as normal humans as in [[Udayagiri Caves]] and in the ''Sheshashayi Vishnu'' panel of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] era (320–550 CE)  [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh|Deogarh]] temple. At Deogarh, the Sudarshana Chakra is depicted against the Chakra/wheel and the Kaumodaki holding a gada. In another instance, the ayudhapurushas are depicted without their weapons, though [[C. Sivaramamurti]] opines that there is enough evidence to identify them as ayudhapurushas. The human Chakrapurusha depicted against the Chakra is seen on the ''chakra-vikrama'' coin of the Gupta ruler [[Chandragupta II]] where the Chakrapurusha – here denoting the wheel of sovereignty – is dedicated bestowing the three pellets of sovereignty to the king. The Gupta era and medieval sculptures often depict the ayudhapurushas in normal human proportions. [[Chola]] and [[Chalukya]] sculptors continued the trend, mostly focussing on the Sudarshana Chakra in a fierce multiple-armed human form.&lt;ref&gt;C. Sivaramamurti pp. 128–30&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, the ayudhapurusha is depicted emerging from the associated weapon.&lt;ref name="anna"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rao288ff"/&gt;

In another variation, the ayushapurusha stands besides the deity with folded hands (in [[Añjali Mudrā|anjali]] mudra posture) with the weapon depicted on the head as part of the crown or the weapon mark on the forehead. The Sudarshana Chakra with the Chakra on his head in Deogarh and Chola era bronzes of Chakra and Gada in similar fashion are some illustrations.&lt;ref name="anna"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rao288ff"&gt;Rao pp. 288–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sivaramamurti130ff"&gt;C. Sivaramamurti pp. 130–1&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last variation of the ayudhapurusha iconography, he/she holds the associated weapon. Common examples are the Sudarshana Chakra, the Shankha-purusha and Kaumodaki, mostly found in [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bengal]] art. Sharanga with the bow in his hand and Nandaka with the sword as in Deogarh are other examples.&lt;ref name="anna"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rao288ff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sivaramamurti130ff"/&gt;

In some cases, the weapon may be depicted as in both anthropomorphic and their true form. While the central icon of Vishnu may hold the weapons, the ayudhapurushas of the same weapon may stand at the feet of the central icon.&lt;ref&gt;C. Sivaramamurti p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vahana''''' ({{lang-sa|वाहन}}, {{IAST|Vāhanam}} or '''animal vehicle''', literally "that which carries, that which pulls") denotes the being, typically an animal or mythical, a particular [[Hindus|Hindu]] God is said to use as a vehicle. In this capacity, the vahana is often called the deity's "mount". Upon the partnership between the deity and his vahana is woven much [[Hindu iconography|iconography]] and [[Hindu mythology|Hindu theology]]. Deities are often depicted riding (or simply mounted upon) the vahana. Other times, the vahana is depicted at the deity's side or symbolically represented as a divine attribute. The vahana may be considered an [[:wikt:accoutrement|accoutrement]]&lt;ref&gt;Accoutrement = "that which accompanies".&lt;/ref&gt; of the deity: though the vahana may act independently, they are still functionally emblematic or even [[:wikt:syntagmatic|syntagmatic]] of their "rider". The deity may be seen sitting or standing on the vahana. They may be sitting on a small platform, or riding on a saddle or bareback.&lt;ref name="GLOSSARY"&gt;[http://ganapati.club.fr/anglais/aglossaryv.html#vahana Glossary: Vahana] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205170026/http://ganapati.club.fr/anglais/aglossaryv.html#vahana |date=2009-02-05 }}.  Undated.  Accessed August 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Etymology ==
''Vah'' in [[Sanskrit]] means to carry, or transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2021-08-12 |title=Animals as vehicles of Gods [Chapter 2.7] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/essay/animal-kingdom-tiryak-in-epics/d/doc825653.html |access-date=2022-08-11 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en |archive-date=2022-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220811075831/https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/essay/animal-kingdom-tiryak-in-epics/d/doc825653.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
In Hindu [[iconography]], positive aspects of the vehicle are often [[emblem]]atic of the deity that it carries. [[Nandi bull|Nandi]] the bull, vehicle of Shiva, represents strength and virility. Dinka the mouse, vehicle of [[Ganesha]], represents speed and sharpness. Parvani the peacock, vehicle of [[Kartikeya]], represents splendor and majesty. The [[hamsa (bird)|hamsa]], vehicle of [[Saraswati]], represents wisdom, grace, and beauty.

However, the vehicle animal also symbolizes the evil forces over which the deity dominates. Mounted on Parvani, Kartikeya reins in the peacock's vanity. Seated on Dinka the rat (Mushika), Ganesha crushes useless thoughts, which multiply like rats in the dark. [[Shani]], protector of property, has a vulture, raven, or crow within whom he represses thieving tendencies. Under Shani's influence, the vahana can make even malevolent events bring hope.

== Examples ==

=== Garuda ===
[[Garuda]], and his story of becoming the mount of Vishnu, is richly detailed in Hindu texts. Born to [[Vinata]] and bearing the power of [[Kashyapa]]'s penance, the demigod is anguished to find that his mother is enslaved by the cruel [[Kadru]]. When he pleaded with Kadru to free his mother, the latter demanded the nectar of immortality as the price of her liberty. His legend of securing [[amrita]], the nectar of immortality, is described in the episode known as ''Amṛtakalaśāpaharaṇam''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2019-01-28 |title=Story of Garuḍa |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/compilation/puranic-encyclopaedia/d/doc241592.html |access-date=2022-08-11 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en |archive-date=2022-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220811075832/https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/compilation/puranic-encyclopaedia/d/doc241592.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;'':''
{{Blockquote|text=Garuḍa approached the pot of nectar, and Viśvakarmā who attacked him first was felled to the ground. The dust storm raised by the waving of Garuḍa’s wings blinded everybody. The Devas and Indra, nay, even the sun and the Moon lined up against Garuḍa, but he defeated them all, and entered the particular place where the pot of nectar was kept. Two terrific wheels were rotating round the pot and they would cut into mince-meat anybody who tried to lay hands on the pot and a machine circled the wheels. Below the wheels were two monstrous serpents with glowing eyes and protruding tongues like flashes of fire, and the serpents never closed their eyes. The very look with those eyes was enough to poison anyone to death. Garuḍa blinded those eyes by raising a torrent of dust, pierced them in the middle with his beak and through the hole, his body reduced to such a tiny shape, went nearer to the pot. He destroyed the wheels and the machine, and carrying the pot of nectar in his beaks rose to the sky shielding the light of the sun by his outspread wings. Mahāviṣṇu, who became so much pleased with the tremendous achievements of Garuḍa asked him to choose any boon. Garuḍa requested Viṣṇu that he should be made his (Viṣṇu's) vehicle and rendered immortal without his tasting amṛta. Both the boons were granted.}}

=== Mushika ===
While the god [[Ganesha]] was still a child, a giant mouse began to terrorize all his friends. Ganesha trapped him with his [[pasha (Hinduism)|lasso]] and made him his mount. Mushika was originally a [[gandharva]], or celestial musician. After absent mindedly walking over the feet of a [[rishi]] (sage) named Vamadeva, Mushika was cursed and transformed into a mouse. However, after the rishi recovered his temper, he promised Mushika that one day, the gods themselves would bow down before him. The prophecy was fulfilled when the mouse became the vahana of Ganesha.

=== Nandi ===
Before becoming the vehicle of Shiva, Nandi was a deity called [[Nandikeshvara]], lord of joy and master of music and dance. Then, without warning, his name and his functions were transferred to the aspect of Shiva known as the deity [[Nataraja]]. From half-man, half-bull, he became simply a bull. Since that time, he has watched over each of Shiva's temples, always looking towards him.

=== Paravani ===
[[Kartikeya]], the war-god known as Murugan in [[Southern India]], is mounted on a peacock named Paravani. This peacock was originally a demon called [[Surapadma]], while the rooster was called the angel [Krichi]. After provoking Murugan in combat, the demon repented at the moment his lance descended upon him. He took the form of a tree and began to pray. The tree was cut in two. From one half, Murugan pulled a [[rooster]], which he made his emblem, and from the other, a peacock, which he made his mount. In another version, Karthikeya was born to kill the demon, [[Tarakasura]]. He was raised by the [[Krittika]]s and led the divine armies when he was 6 days old. It is said that after defeating Tarakasura, the god forgave him and transformed him into his ride, the peacock.

==Compared to other belief systems==
The animal correspondences of Hindu vehicles are not consistent with [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], or other belief systems which may tie a particular animal to a particular deity. For example, the goddess [[Lakshmi]] of the Hindus has elephants, or an owl, or (a rare instance of a non-animal vehicle) the lotus blossom as her vehicle. The goddess [[Athena]] of ancient [[Greece]] also had an owl as her emblematic familiar, but the meanings invested in the owls by the two different belief systems are not the same, nor are the two goddesses themselves similar, despite their mutual identification with owls.

Lakshmi is, among other things, primarily the goddess of wealth, and her owl is a warning against distrust and isolationism, even selfishness. Athena, though also a goddess of prosperity, is primarily the goddess of wisdom, and her owl symbolizes secret knowledge and scholarship. Perhaps due to their shared geography, the Greco-Roman interpretation is paralleled in [[Roman Catholic]] [[iconography]], in which [[St. Jerome]], most famed for editing the [[New Testament]], is often (though not always) depicted with an owl as a symbol of wisdom and scholarship.&lt;ref name="NMSU"&gt;[http://artdepartment.nmsu.edu/faculty/zarursite/retablo/col-saints.html The Collection: St. Jerome] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022221000/http://artdepartment.nmsu.edu/faculty/zarursite/retablo/col-saints.html |date=2012-10-22 }}, gallery of the religious art collection of [[New Mexico State University]], with explanations. Accessed August 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the tribe, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] religious iconography attributes a wide range of attributes to the owl, both positive and negative, as do the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and [[Russia]]n cultures, but none parallel the Hindu attributes assigned to the owl as Lakshmi's divine vehicle.&lt;ref name="OP"&gt;[http://www.owlpages.com/articles.php?section=Owl+Mythology&amp;title=Owls+Lore+Culture&amp;page=3 Owl and Mythology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522220935/http://www.owlpages.com/articles.php?section=Owl+Mythology&amp;title=Owls+Lore+Culture&amp;page=3 |date=2006-05-22 }}, p. 3.  Accessed August 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some hold that similar analyses could be performed cross-culturally for any of the other Hindu divine vehicles, and in each case, any parallels with the values assigned to animal totems in other cultures are likely to be either coincidence, or inevitable (as in linking bulls to virility), rather than evidence of parallel development. In [[dialectic]], this is countered by the retort that each totem or vahana, as an aspect of ''[[ishta-devata]]'' (or an ''ishta-devata'' or ''[[asura]]'' in its own right), has innumerable ineffable teachings, [[insight]]s and [[Prajna (Vedic)|spiritual wisdom]]; comparative analysis yields benefit, though knowledge and understanding is not served by collapsing their qualities into homogenous [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]].

These correspondences are not always consistent. Ganesha, for example, is sometimes shown with a peacock as his vehicle. Even more rarely, the elephant-headed Ganesh may be seen riding an elephant, or a lion, or a many-headed serpent (See [[Ganesha#Vahanas|Ganesha's Vahanas]]).&lt;ref name="GANAPTI"&gt;[http://ganapati.club.fr/anglais/adetform2.html Forms of Ganesh: The Mouse Mount and Other Ganesh Mounts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302140610/http://ganapati.club.fr/anglais/adetform2.html |date=2007-03-02 }}.  Accessed August 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''vahana'', the mount or vehicle of a deity, serves the function of doubling a deity's powers. The vahana also represents the devotee's mind which allows the deity to guide the devotee. Durga the warrioress could not have destroyed the demon [[Mahishasura]] without the aid of her vehicle, lion, which was given by her father Himalaya, for the stated purpose. Lakshmi, goddess of fortune, dispenses both material and spiritual riches from her mount, Uluka the owl. Ganesha, remover of obstacles, cannot go everywhere despite his elephant-like strength. However, his vehicle, Mushika the mouse, who can crawl into the smallest crevice or Akhuketana the rat, who can survive just about anywhere, can assist Ganesha to overcome the greatest obstacles.

Male kuladevatas are sometimes referred to as a '''kuladeva''', while their female counterparts are called a '''kuladevi'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2017-10-17 |title=Kuladeva, Kula-deva: 7 definitions |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/kuladeva |access-date=2022-10-01 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''kuladevata'' is derived from two words: ''kula'', meaning [[clan]], and ''devata'', meaning [[deity]], referring to the ancestral deities that are worshipped by particular clans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Saravanan |first=V.

== Veneration ==
The deity can be represented in a male or a female human, an animal, or even an object, like a holy stone. It is believed that rituals done at a kuladeva/kuladevi temple benefits all those genetically connected with the one performing the ritual.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}} Kuladaivams of the [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] tradition are often considered to be forms of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]], while those of the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] tradition are often regarded to be forms of [[Vishnu]] and [[Lakshmi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2022-05-19 |title=Shiva and Shaivism - Origin, Beliefs, Practices, History &amp; mentions in Vedas |url=https://www.templepurohit.com/shiva-shaivism-origin-beliefs-practices-history-mentions-vedas/ |access-date=2022-10-02 |website=TemplePurohit - Your Spiritual Destination {{!}} Bhakti, Shraddha Aur Ashirwad |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu families make a pilgrimage to the kuladevata or kuladevi temple to obtain the blessing of the deity after an auspicious occasion, such as a wedding. Kuladevatas are worshipped in several sects of [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]]. 

Due to the veneration of holy men (''babas'') in several regions of the subcontinent, several communities consider such men to be their kuladevatas in the place of a deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kurien |first=Prema |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxneawQ8sKQC&amp;dq=holy+men+kuladevata&amp;pg=PA36 |title=A Place at the Multicultural Table: The Development of an American Hinduism |date=2007-06-19 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-4161-7 |pages=36 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abhasvaras''' ({{Lang-sa|आभास्वर|translit=Ābhāsvara}}) is a term used in [[Buddhism]] to refer to a heaven and in [[Hinduism]] to refer to a class of [[Devata|deities]].

==Buddhism==
In [[Buddhism]], Abhasvaras is the name of a [[heaven]]. The words roots are Sanskrit (from "a" near to, towards + the verbal root "bhas" to shine upon, illuminate).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Hinduism==
In [[Hinduism]], abhasvaras refers to a class of deities featured in the [[Puranas]]. They are 64 in number,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Werner |first=Karel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__yQAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=abhasvara+deities&amp;pg=PT29 |title=A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism |date=2005-08-11 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-79752-2 |pages=29 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described to be personifications of mental qualities, serving as the sovereigns of all varieties of spiritual and physical enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dalal |first=Roshen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrk0AwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=abhasvaras+gana&amp;pg=PT103 |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |date=2014-04-18 |publisher=Penguin UK |isbn=978-81-8475-277-9 |pages=103 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twelve primary abhasvaras are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Danielou |first=Alain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OIXtDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%C4%80bh%C4%81svaras&amp;pg=PA302 |title=The Myths and Gods of India: The Classic Work on Hindu Polytheism |date=2017-01-01 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-3638-9 |pages=303 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surya Majapahit''' ([[Kawi language|Kawi]]: ꦯꦸꦂꦪꦩꦗꦥꦲꦶꦠ꧀, [[Sanskrit]]: मजपहितस्य सूर्य) (Surya of the Majapahit) is the [[emblem]] commonly found in ruins dated from the [[Majapahit]] era. The emblem commonly took the form of an eight-pointed [[sun]] ray with the rounded part in the center depicting [[Hindu]] deities. The emblem might have taken the form of a [[cosmology|cosmological]] diagram haloed by typical sun rays,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Bullough Nigel| title= Historic East Java, Remains in Stone, 50th Anniversary of Indonesia Commemorative Edition | publisher = ADLine Communications | year= 1995| location =Jakarta| page =109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a simple circle with typical sun rays. Because of the popularity of the Surya emblem during the Majapahit era, it has been suggested that may have served as the imperial symbol of the Majapahit empire.

==Hindu deities==
The most common depiction of Surya Majapahit consists of the images of nine deities and eight sun rays.
The round center of the sun depicting nine [[Hindu deities|Hindu Gods]] called ''[[Guardians of the directions|Dewata Nawa Sanga]]''. The major gods in the center is arranged in eight cardinal points around [[Shiva]] in the center. The arrangements are:
*Center: [[Shiva]]
*East: [[Isvara]]
*West: [[Shiva|Mahadeva]]
*North: [[Vishnu]]
*South: [[Brahma]]
*Northeast: [[Shiva|Sambhu]]
*Northwest: [[Shiva|Sangkara/shankara]]
*Southeast: [[Maheshvara|Mahesora]]
*Southwest: [[Rudra]]

Eight other deities are located at the outer rim of the sun, symbolized by eight shining sun rays:
*East: [[Indra]]
*West: [[Varuna]]
*North: [[Kubera]]
*South: [[Yama]]
*Northeast: [[Ishana|Isana]]
*Northwest: [[Vayu]]
*Southeast: [[Agni]]
*Southwest: [[Nirṛti]]

[[File:Surya Majapahit.jpg|thumb|right|Another render of Surya Majapahit, taken from Majapahit temple ruins, National Museum Jakarta]]

The emblem is rendered in many forms; sometimes it took the form of the circle of deities and sun rays, or just a simple eight-pointed sun ray such as the emblematic Surya Majapahit set into the ceiling of [[Candi Penataran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Bullough Nigel| title= Historic East Java, Remains in Stone, 50th Anniversary of Indonesia Commemorative Edition | publisher = ADLine Communications | year= 1995| location =Jakarta| page =91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deities in the sun arranged as cosmological diagram in the form of a [[mandala]]. Another variation of Surya Majapahit is the eight pointed sun rays with the god of sun [[Surya]] in the center riding celestial horse or chariot.
The carving of Surya Majapahit usually can be found on the center ceiling of the [[Garbhagriha]] (inner sanctum) of the temple such as Bangkal, Sawentar, and [[Candi Jawi|Jawi]] temple. Surya Majapahit also can be found on the Stella, carving of [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] or [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] at the back of the statue's head. The carving of Surya Majapahit also commonly found in gravestone dating from Majapahit era, such as the Troloyo cemetery in [[Trowulan]].

'''''Ishta-deva''''' or '''''ishta devata''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: इष्ट देव(ता), {{IAST|iṣṭa-deva(tā)}}, literally "cherished [[Deva (Hinduism)|divinity]]" from ''iṣṭa'', "personal, liked, cherished, preferred" and ''[[devatā]]'', "godhead, divinity, [[tutelary deity]]" or ''[[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'', "deity"), is a term used in [[Hinduism]] denoting a worshipper's favourite deity.&lt;ref&gt;V. S. Apte, ''A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary'', p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Hindu Festival of Divali in the Caribbean |doi=10.1080/00086495.1976.11829270|journal= Caribbean Quarterly|volume=22|year=1976|issue=1|page=57|last1=Jha|first1=J.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is especially significant to both the [[Smarta]] and [[Bhakti]] schools, wherein practitioners choose to worship the form of God that inspires them. Within [[Smartism]], one of [[Ishta-Deva#Formal Smarta worship|five chief deities]] is selected. Even in denominations that focus on a singular concept of God, such as [[Vaishnavism]], the ishta-deva concept exists. For example, in [[Vaishnavism]], special focus is given to a particular form of [[Lord Vishnu|Vishnu]] or one of his [[Avatar|avatara]]s (i.e. [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]]). Similarly within [[Shaktism]], focus is given to a particular form of the Goddess such as [[Parvati]] or [[Lakshmi]]. The [[Swaminarayan]] sect of Vaishnavism has a similar concept, but notably holds that Vishnu and [[Shiva]] are different aspects of the same God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/scriptures/scriptureexplanation.asp?IDProduct%3D726%26idcategory%3D2 |access-date=25 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317164651/http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/scriptures/scriptureexplanation.asp?IDProduct=726&amp;idcategory=2 |archivedate=17 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smarta worship==
The "worship of the five forms" ({{IAST|[[pañcāyatana pūjā]]}}) system, which was popularized by philosopher [[Adi Shankara]] among orthodox Brahmins of the [[Smartism|Smārta]] tradition, invokes the five deities [[Ganesha]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], [[Shakti]], and [[Surya|Sūrya]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, John A.

(Oxford University Press: New York, 1985). {{ISBN|0-19-505742-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This system was instituted by {{IAST|Śaṅkarācārya}} primarily to unite the principal deities of the five major sects ({{IAST|Gāṇapatya, Śaiva, Vaiṣṇava, Shakta and Saura}}) on an equal status. The [[Monism|monistic]] philosophy preached by {{IAST|Śaṅkarācārya}} made it possible to choose one of these as a preferred principal deity and at the same time worship the other four deities as different forms of the same all-pervading [[Brahman]].

==Worship forms==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
[[File:Jhulelal hindu deity.jpg|x216px|right|thumb|[[Murti]] of Ishta Dev of Sindhi people [[Jhulelal (Hinduism)|Jhulelal]]]]
Typically a practitioner worships their Ishta-Deva through the form of a [[murti]]. This worship may involve offering items to their chosen divinity such as [[incense]] or flowers, reciting [[mantra]]s, [[bhajan|singing their names]] and offering [[prayer]]s.

Remembering the deity and internally building a relationship with (or through) them is considered essential to the practise. Within the [[Advaita]] schools it is believed that the [[human]] [[mind]] needs a concrete form to understand the divine that ultimately can never be defined. Just as one can understand the abstract concept of a [[color]] only after one has seen a concrete form, one can only realize the deity through a form of [[murti]]. In contrast, the [[Dvaita]] schools believe the Supreme Being to possess a divine form, and offer worship to their Ishta-Deva as either a representation or direct expansion of the Supreme Person. For example, [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] schools offer worship exclusively to murtis of Vishnu, or his associated avatars such as [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]].

[[Shaivism|Shaivites]] worship Shiva, either figuratively, or through his [[Lingam]] murti. As Shaivism contains both monistic and dualistic traditions either (or both) of the above approaches may be applicable.

[[Image:Vishnou Népal Guimet 21107.jpg|thumb|Vaikuntha-Kamalaja, [[Nepal]], gilt copper and inlaid, 14th century, [[Guimet Museum]].]]
'''Vaikuntha-Kamalaja''' (or '''Lakshmi-Narayana''') is a composite [[androgynous]] form of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Vishnu]] and his consort [[Lakshmi]]. Though inspired by the much more popular [[Ardhanarishvara]] form of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]], Vaikuntha-Kamalaja is a rare form, mostly restricted to [[Nepal]] and the [[Kashmir]] region of [[India]].

Like Ardhanarishvara, Vaikuntha-Kamalaja is depicted as half male and half female, split down the middle. The right half is the male Vishnu, illustrating his traditional attributes. The icon symbolises the oneness or non-duality of male and female principles of the universe. Unlike the Ardhanarishvara icon much celebrated in Hindu scriptures, Vaikuntha-Kamalaja is mentioned in few [[Tantra|Tantric]] and iconographical texts and no tale of the origins of this form is found in Hindu legends.

==Names==
The androgynous form of Vishnu is known by several names including: Vaikuntha Kamalaja,&lt;ref name="pal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britishMuseum"/&gt; ([[Vaikuntha]] is the abode of Vishnu, here name of the Vishnu side and Kamalaja is "she who is born of a lotus" – Lakshmi), [[Vaishnava]] Ardhanari ("the [[Ardhanari]] – "half-woman" of the Vaishnava sect, which is dedicated to Vishnu), Ardhanari-Narayana&lt;ref name="sircar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sircar|first=D.

The concept as well as iconography of Vaikuntha-Kamalaja is derived from [[Ardhanarishvara]] – the popular androgynous form of the god [[Shiva]] and his consort Parvati.&lt;ref name="pal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pal|first=Pratapaditya |year=1967|title=Vaiṣṇava Art from Nepal in the Museum|journal=Boston Museum Bulletin|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|volume=65|issue=340|pages=44–45|jstor=4171471}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britishMuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sircar"/&gt; P. Pal suggests that the concept of Vaikuntha-Kamalaja originated in Eastern India and then migrated to Nepal, however according to Deo, the concept originated in medieval Nepal, which D. C. Sircar refutes citing an 11th-century Gaya inscription.&lt;ref name="sircar"/&gt; A late 11th century inscription of the local ruler Yakshapala in the Shitala Gaya Temple in [[Gaya, India|Gaya]], India says that Yakshapala built the temple to house a number of deities, including ''Kamalardhangina-Narayana'', "Narayana (Vishnu) whose half body is Kamala ("Lakshmi").&lt;ref name="sircar"/&gt; According to another theory, [[Kashmir]] was the birthplace of Vaikuntha-Kamalaja.&lt;ref name="kashmir"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malla|first=Bansi Lal|title=Vaiṣṇava art and iconography of Kashmir|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=1996|pages=45–9|chapter=Vasudeva-Laksmi|isbn=81-7017-305-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although relevant Indian texts and icons of Vaikuntha-Kamalaja are found in Nepal, hardly any exist in India except [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref name="pal"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Varadpande"/&gt; Some notable Indian icons of Vaikuntha-Kamalaja are found at Bijbehara (late 10th–11th century), [[Anantnag]], Kashmir; [[Jaintipur]], Haryana; [[Baijnath, Himachal Pradesh|Baijnath Temple]], Himachal Pradesh (1204 CE) and the ''Sayana Thakura'' icon of [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]], [[Puri]].&lt;ref name="puri"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miśra|first=Narayan |title=Annals and antiquities of the temple of Jagannātha|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|year=2007|pages=18|isbn=978-81-7625-747-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kashmir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baijnath"/&gt;

Vaikuntha-Kamalaja icons are found in Nepal since 13th century.&lt;ref name = "Varadpande"/&gt; The earliest known Nepali depiction of Vaikuntha-Kamalaja is in a 1263 AD ''pata'' (cloth panel), now in the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] Institute of Culture, [[Kolkata]], India.&lt;ref name="britishMuseum"/&gt; Some Nepali bronze sculptures of Vaikuntha-Kamalaja are housed in some museums.&lt;ref name="britishMuseum"/&gt; Notable among Vaikuntha-Kamalaja icons are icons in Indreshvar Temple, [[Panauti]]; Narayan Temple, [[Patan, Lalitpur|Patan]] and Saraswati Temple, [[Sankhu]].&lt;ref name = "Varadpande"/&gt;

While Ardhanarishvara's legends and iconography are recalled in the [[Puranic]] scriptures, Vaikuntha-Kamalaja is not mentioned in them.&lt;ref name="sircar"/&gt; The Vaikuntha-Kamalaja is hinted implicitly in many [[Pancharatra]] treatises and Tantric texts.&lt;ref name="pal"/&gt; Tantric iconographic texts like Saradatilaka (10th–11th century-in a ''dhyana [[mantra]]'' -a mantra mentioning a deity's iconic form), the 17th century [[Tantrasara]] of Krishnananda (in a ''dhyana [[mantra]]'') as well as the 16th century [[Shilparatna]] mentions the iconography of this androgynous form of Vishnu.&lt;ref name="pal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britishMuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sircar"/&gt;

==Iconography and symbolism==
[[File:Vaikuntha Kamalaja (Podar Haveli Museum).jpg|thumb|North Indian-style mural of Vaikuntha Kamalaja in Podar Haveli Museum, [[Nawalgarh, Rajasthan]].
]]
As explained in Saradatilaka and Tantrasara, Vaikuntha-Kamalaja, like Ardhanarishvara, symbolise the oneness or non-duality of male and female principles of the universe.&lt;ref name="pal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britishMuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="puri"/&gt; The Shilparatna specifically talks about the oneness of Vishnu and Lakshmi.&lt;ref name="puri"/&gt; It also denotes the combination of ''Sat'' (truth) and ''Cit'' (consciousness), producing ''ananda'' (bliss) (See [[Satcitananda]]).&lt;ref name="garg"/&gt; Like Ardhanarishvara, the left half is female signifying Lakshmi, the right is the male Vishnu. The icon is depicted standing on a lotus pedestal or may be seated on the [[Garuda]] or Garuda (the [[vahana]] – mount – of Vishnu) as well as a tortoise or [[Kurma]], often associated with Vishnu, but aligned with Lakshmi as her mount in this particular iconography. Sometimes, the Garuda and the tortoise may be depicted kneeling to the deity on male and female side respectively of the standing deity. Vaikuntha-Kamalaja is eight-armed, has a fuller female breast and a longer floral-patterned waist-garment on the left, while the male half wears a plain shorter waist-garment up to the knee or a same length garment but with a different design. The Vishnu half holds the four traditional attributes of Vishnu: [[Sudarshana chakra|chakra]](discus), [[shankha]] (conch), gada (mace) and lotus. The female half holds a ''[[kalasha]]'' (coconut-mango leaves atop a pot) or ''kumbha'' (water-pot) filled with gems, mirror, manuscript or book and a lotus. The goddess side may also hold a bell or a rosary. The manuscript and mirror are never associated with Lakshmi's iconography, however they are traditionally associated with other goddesses, suggesting their influence on the iconography of female side. The manuscript is the attribute of goddess [[Sarasvati]], while the mirror is the traditional attribute of [[Parvati]], especially in Ardhanarishvara icons. The necklace, anklets, waist-belt are common on both sides; the ear-rings, shape of the crown and arm ornaments differ.&lt;ref name="pal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britishMuseum"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pal|first=Pratapaditya|date=Winter 1964–1965|title=Notes on Five Sculptures from Nepal|journal=The British Museum Quarterly|publisher=[[British Museum]]|volume=29|issue=1/2|pages=32–33|doi=10.2307/4422882|jstor=4422882}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sircar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baijnath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baijnathtemple.com/sculpture1.htm|title=ARDH LAXMI-NARAYAN: Sculptures in Baijnath, Himachal Pradesh|access-date=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village deities of Southern India are the numerous spirits and other beings venerated as part of the [[Dravidian folk religion|Dravidian folk tradition]] in villages throughout South India. These deities, mainly goddesses, are intimately associated with the well-being of the village, and can have either benevolent or violent tendencies. These deities are presently in various stages of syncretism or assimilation with mainstream [[Hinduism|Hindu]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Joseph |first1=M. P. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwhrDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=amman+hinduism+syncretism&amp;pg=PA207 |title=Wrestling with God in Context: Revisiting the Theology and Social Vision of Shoki Coe |last2=Huang |first2=Po Ho |last3=Hsu |first3=Victor |date=2018-12-01 |publisher=Fortress Press |isbn=978-1-5064-4581-6 |pages=208 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These deities have been linked back to common [[Indus Valley civilisation]] imagery, and are hypothesised to represent the prevailing [[Dravidian folk religion]] at the time. The worship of these deities at many times do not conform to the common tenets of [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] traditions, especially in customs of animal sacrifice, the inclusion of the priesthood class, and iconography. 

== Origins and history ==
[[File:Female figure, possibly a fertility goddess, Indus Valley Tradition, Harappan Phase, c. 2500-1900 BC - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC09701.JPG|thumb|Female figure, possibly fertility goddess, from the [[Indus Valley civilisation|Indus Valley civilization.]]]]
In general, scholars see the village deities of South India as continuations of religious traditions followed in the subcontinent before the arrival of the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]]. In the early centuries BCE, village goddesses are represented with various symbols such as the ''chakra'' (wheel), ''[[Shrivatsa|srivatsa]]'' (an unending knot), and ''[[trishula]]'' (trident), all of which have parallels in the Indus Valley civilisation. It thus seems likely that the worship of these village deities was also present in the Indus Valley civilization at some point. In the Deccan Plateau, the first art forms for the fertility goddess appeared between the 8th and 4th century BCE, before the recorded arrival of other traditions like [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and the [[Historical Vedic religion#Brahminism|Vedic religion]] into the region.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Padma|first=Sree|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199325023.001.0001|title=Vicissitudes of the Goddess|date=2013-10-11|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199325023.001.0001|isbn=978-0-19-932502-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
There are two main types of deity propitiated in a village. Any of these deities can be considered a ''[[kuladevata]]''.
[[File:Chikkamma Doddamma God at Bikkanapalli by Madesh Chikkegowda.jpg|thumb|Example of a fertility goddess, Chikkamma Doddamma, common in South Karnataka]]
Most villages tradionally have a fertility goddess. This goddess is believed to arise from the natural world itself, and to be intrinsically linked to the ground of the village. She is a representation of the village itself, rather than simply a guardian figure. Sometimes her head is represented in a carving at the center of the village, while the rest of the village is considered her body. She often has the additional responsibility of overseeing rain, since, in the areas of South India east of the [[Western Ghats]], the monsoon rains are the primary source of water for agriculture. She is the main protector of the village, especially against common diseases like smallpox or plague. Other goddesses preside over specific household objects, or act as guardians of cattle or children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most of these deities are unique to their village and have their own origin stories, and many are worshipped only by members of a particular community. [[Mariamman]] is one of the most popular of this class of deity, worshipped throughout South India. She provides fertility and, in many places, protection against smallpox and other deadly diseases. Other popular goddesses include Pochamma in Telugu regions and [[Renuka|Yellamma]] in northern Karnataka and western Telangana. Another common theme is the seven sisters, called ''[[Matrikas|saptamatrikas]]'' in Vedic traditions. This collection of goddesses does not have a specific function, but may be called upon if a disease is affecting the family. In the area around [[Tirumala]], it is said that these deities can be seen as young girls wandering around at noon, dusk or night.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Village goddesses can have different personalities. Some are kindly, and will shower blessings on those who worship them. Others are vengeful and angry, and will unleash terror on the village unless they are propitiated. Many of these deities are especially worshipped by one particular community, for example Yellamma is worshipped especially by two Dalit communities: Malas and Madigas.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Whitehead, Henry, 1853-1947.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/636168782|title=The village gods of south India|date=1916|publisher=H. Milford, Oxford University Press|isbn=0-524-02678-5|location=London|oclc=636168782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these deities originated with tribal communities and became worshipped by wider society., such as Kondalamma in the hills of East Godavari district.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Villages, especially in Tamil and Telugu regions, also have a guardian deity: a male deity who protects the village from harm like war or famine or other evils. Unlike the fertility goddess, this deity is worshipped throughout a wide region and has less variety. In northern Tamil Nadu, this deity is called [[Aiyanar|Aiyyanar]], while in southern Tamil Nadu, he is known as [[Shasta (deity)|Shasta]]. His name in Telugu is [[Pothuraju|Poturaju]] and is the brother of the presiding goddess in those villages. A common origin myth for ''Poturaju'' is that he drank the blood of demons slain by ''amma''. In Tamil Nadu, there are a host of other male deities, such as [[Karuppu Sami|Karuppusami]], who are either attendants to Ayyanar or guardians for the main goddess. Most of these gods are ''kuladevatas'' for families in the village, especially for dominant castes who are patrilineal. In this context guardianship has two meanings: either as guardian of devotees or the guardian of a greater village deity, subservient to them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mythology ==
The mythology surrounding these deities varies considerably by region and deity. However several basic trends can be established. For instance, most village deities are rooted in the idea that some form of ''Shakti'' is the primordial force in the universe, sometimes called ''[[Adi Parashakti|Adi Shakti]]'' or ''Adi Mahashakti''. From her arose all other deities, including the ''Trimurti'' of Vedic traditions. The village goddesses are usually related as ''avatars'' of Adi Shakti.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Valk|first1=Ülo|last2=Lourdusamy|first2=S.|date=2007|title=Village Deities of Tamil Nadu in Myths and Legends: The Narrated Experience|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30030456|journal=Asian Folklore Studies|volume=66|issue=1/2|pages=179–199|jstor=30030456|issn=0385-2342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each deity will have an origin story of some kind to explain why they do not appear in the Puranas. An example of this is [[Aiyanar|Ayyanar]], whose origin story in the Arcot region is related to the story of [[Bhasmasura|Padmasuran]] (also known as Bhasmasura), who was given a boon by Shiva to turn anyone whose head he touched into ash. But Padmasuran attacked Shiva himself, who became frightened turned into an ''aivelangai'' fruit. However, Shiva's brother-in-law (In Tamil tradition, Vishnu is often considered Parvati's brother), Vishnu, heard his plea for help and appeared as Mohini. Entrancing the Asura, Mohini said he had to take a bath in order to be hers. The Asura could only find a small amount of water and put it on his head, after which he burst into ashes. Vishnu then told Shiva all was clear and after being told the tale, Shiva wished to see Vishnu as Mohini. When he obliged, Shiva became aroused and his semen came out. To prevent it from touching the ground Vishnu caught it in his hand, and Ayyanar was born. This invention of tradition is a way to explain why these deities do not appear in the Puranic stories and to give them a sense of "legitimacy" in the greater tradition. Another myth from that same region about the origin of another popular deity, [[Muneeswarar|Muneeshwarar]], claims he was created by [[Shiva]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;[[File:At mahabarata.JPG|thumb|[[Pothuraju|Poturaju]] standing in front of statues of the Pandavas in a village of [[Chittoor district]], [[Andhra Pradesh]]]]
Occasionally, the fertility goddess or guardian deity can be the spirit of a historical figure. This practice has roots in ancient times: as early as the [[Sangam period]], hero stones (''natukal/viragal'' in Tamil, ''veeragalu'' in Kannada), stones erected to honour those men who laid down their lives for the village, were worshipped and propitiated. Similar to hero stones, sati stones honour women who sacrificed their life, especially for chastity and purity. The early Tamil poem [[Tolkāppiyam|''Tolkappiyam'']] gives a six-stage guide to the erection of such a stone, from selection of a suitable stone until the institution of formal worship. In time, many of these spirits have merged into or become the local guardian deity. Examples of deified heroes include [[Madurai Veeran]] (from [[Madurai]]) and Kathavarayan (from [[Thanjavur]]). Oftentimes, these heroes are found as attendants to Ayyanar or a village goddess, especially in Tamil Nadu. The Paanchamman temples in north Tamil Nadu were built to worship widows who underwent [[Sati (practice)|Sati]]. Often, the deities are spirits who suffered injustice in their lives or deaths and must be propitiated to prevent their spirit from affecting the village.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Several couples who have lost their lives due to caste animosity are worshipped as deities in several villages. [[Kannaki Amman]] is [[Kannagi (Tamil mythology)|Kannagi]] from the [[Silappatikaram|''Silappadikaram'']], whose husband was unjustly killed by the Pandyan king, is another widely-worshipped deity of this category. The Machani Amman temple at [[Pollachi]] was built to worship a young girl who was killed by a [[Kongu (region)|Kongu]] king for unknowingly eating a mango from his garden. Oftentimes female spirits are merged into the main fertility goddess, or are venerated as one of her attendants.

Some few deities are less-venerated characters in the epics of the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. For example, there are many temples dedicated to [[Draupati Amman|Draupadiamman]] ([[Draupadi|Panchali]]) and Dharmaraja ([[Yudhishthira]]) in northern Tamil Nadu, a tradition especially prominent among the [[Vanniyar]] community. Temples dedicated to [[Gandhari (character)|Gandhari]] (mother of the [[Kauravas]]), [[Kunti]] (mother of [[Pandavas]]) and [[Iravan|Aravan]] (the son of [[Arjuna]] and the serpent princess [[Ulupi]]) are also found in Tamil Nadu. For these deities, legimitizing mythologies exist in the forms of the Ramayana and Mahabharata.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Representation ==

=== Placement ===
[[File:சாமி கும்பிடும் வழக்கம்.JPG|thumb|A typical Amman temple on the outskirts of the village, Tamil Nadu]]
The place and way in which a deity is represented is symbolic of their role in society. The placement of the deity is also a reflection of the influence it is believed to have on the people. Those deities which are considered "purest" or most beneficial are usually given shrines in the centre of the village. In places where [[Agraharam]]s exist, the "purest" gods are forms of Shiva and Vishnu and are found in that neighbourhood, formerly considered the "purest" part of the village. The more beneficial village goddesses are to be found in the main village, called the ''ur'' in Tamil and Telugu, in various locations. The more malevolent deities are usually given more space on the village outskirts, nearer to settlements variously known as ''keri'', ''palli'' or ''cheri'' in Kannada, Telugu and Tamil respectively. These locations are reserved for the lowest castes, mainly Dalits, but also communities like washermen and barbers. These fierce deities are avoided as much as possible, and their placement is characteristic of traditional views of who was most "orderly."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mines, Diane P.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/717806444|title=Fierce gods : inequality, ritual, and the politics of dignity in a South Indian village|date=2005|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-34576-6|oclc=717806444}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are some exceptions. In Tamil Nadu, the guardian god is given a space along the village boundaries to protect them from harm although he himself is not seen as harmful.

The shrines themselves vary by deity and region. For Tamils, Ayyanar is represented in an open space to better fulfill his duty. However there the goddess is given her own temple similar in form, and sometimes size, to a Vedic temple.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In other regions, however, the goddess (since gods are less venerated in these areas) may be given a shrine at the edge of the village, although it is common to find the shrine next to a tree or a snake-hole. In Telugu regions, the deity sometimes has no permanent shrine, but a temporary ''pandal''. Some goddesses wish to be in the open space to feel the same hardships as their devotees.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Ch|first1=Prof|last2=Ch|first2=an GowdaProf|last3=Jan 16|first3=an Gowda / Updated|last4=2016|title=The World of Village Goddesses|url=https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/opinion/views/The-World-of-Village-Goddesses/articleshow/50596267.cms|access-date=2020-07-20|website=Bangalore Mirror|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet there is no distinction between the dwelling-place of the deity and the deity: the dwelling-place itself is a form of the deity.

=== Iconography ===
The deities themselves are often represented as aniconic, either as a shapeless stone or tree or snake-hole.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Tamil Nadu, the guardian god is often given form as a fierce warrior, holding an ''aruval'' or other weapon, with attendants surrounding him. However ''Poturaju'' in Telugu areas is typically represented only by a stick in the ground. In Telugu and Kannada regions, the goddess is often given anthropomorphic form as a terracotta statue only during a temple festival, and is then returned to her aniconic shape. In many villages in Tamil Nadu, a village god is represented by planting spears or ''trishulas'' in the ground to represent his martial prowess. In the village of Kogilu near Bengaluru, the goddesses were represented by items such as a lamp or a stone pillar. In many areas of South Karnataka, the village goddess is symbolized by an ''aarti'', a lamp made of rice flour shaped like a cone and adorned with kumkuma in the shape of a face.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; All these icons are believed to be the deity itself, rather than simply a vessel to hold it.
[[File:Snake Worship, Tamilnadu.jpg|thumb|Examples of Naga statues in Tamil Nadu]]
Another common symbol is the snake, or ''naga''. Usually they are carved onto stone pillars, either in the shape of a hooded cobra (like ''Adishesha'') or as two snakes intertwined. The snake is symbolic of the earth's fertility, since they are only visible after the monsoon, and as a punisher of those who oppose the goddess. Worship of these specific qualities is done in Kerala, especially by non-Vedic castes such as the Nairs.

== Worship ==
[[File:Kannayakanahalli maaramma.jpeg|thumb|Man doing worship to [[Mariamman|Maaramma]] in [[Mandya district]]|alt=]]
There are a huge diversity of worship practices for these deities, oftentimes depending on the deity's nature and other local customs. However, some general characteristics of worship include local language and, most of the time, non-Brahmin priests.

The worship itself is not done in a language such as Sanskrit, but in the local language. This worship is usually done through oral tales, telling the origin of the goddess. In Tamil Nadu there are several genres of this form such as ''terukoothu'', a form of street folk theatre, ''villu pattu'' (lit. "bow song"), extolling the deeds of great heroes who had been deified, and ''udukkai pattu'', legends done to the sound of percussion. In northern Tamil Nadu these are all subsumed under the world of ''aideegam''.

=== Sacrifice ===
Depending on the temper of the deity, they may be offered animal sacrifices or vegetarian offerings. In Tamil Nadu, it is a goat or chicken that is killed, and depends on the number of families that contribute. In Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, it was once a buffalo that was sacrificed. However, with more Vedic influence due to Hindutva and other factors, the sacrifice has been made a goat or sheep. The actual killing of the animal is done by any non-Brahmin community, but the buffalo was usually killed by one of the Dalit communities: especially the Madigas. This was because the Madigas, whose traditional occupation was leather craftsmanship, would not be "tainted" by the killing and would use the remains of the buffalo for their food and leather.

The sacrifice takes place near the end of the village festival. The animal is doused with water, and if it shivers, it is deemed to be possessed by the deity. Then, the animal is led to the shrine, and is restrained. One man takes an ''aruval'' or other sword and beheads the animal, which is then tossed aside to twitch and bleed out. For fowl, the head can be ripped off or the neck be broken without the use of a weapon. The head itself is placed in front of the deity with a foreleg in its mouth. It is believed that in this position the animal represents a demon, and by giving the demon to the deity it will be able to unite with her and become one again. Thus the villagers have done their duty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The meat is then taken and is used to make a ''prasada'', which is then offered to the deity. Afterwards, it is eaten by the devotees. It was usually the Dalits who got the meat from the buffalo sacrifice since only they would eat buffalo meat. At other times, however, anyone can walk up to the deity and make a sacrifice to them, potentially to ease some personal trouble such as a sick child or obtaining bad luck. The Muthumariamman temple in the Nilgiris was once the place where people swore solemn vows. This was sometimes used by the judicial system in the region during British times, and it was common for witnesses to make a vow of truth and make a sacrifice to Muthumariamman in the presence of a court official, so that all would know they spoke the truth.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rangachari, K.; Thurston Edgar, 1855-1935.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1097031456|title=Castes and Tribes of Southern India Vol. 7 of 7.|publisher=Project Gutenberg|oclc=1097031456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Festivals ===
Festivals for village deities vary widely and can be done at various times. In [[Tirunelveli district|Tirunelveli]] in southern Tamil Nadu, for instance, most deity festivals take place throughout the dry summer months before the monsoon. For most deities, the festival is only celebrated by those with a close connection to the deity: e.g. those for whom the deity is their ''kuladevata'', caste deity or deity of their locality. Financing of these festivals is generally done via a tax on all members of that deity's "celebratory group." However for village deities, such as the local ''amman'' goddess, the festival is celebrated by the entirety of the village in one way or another.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Oftentimes someone, usually from one of the Dalit communities, is possessed by the goddess, and devotees can ask her questions and sometimes criticize her.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another characteristic is the timing of festivals. Village festivals are often celebrated for the first sowing or harvest, but often festivals will be called at unknown time. If there is a pestilent disease spreading in the area, the villagers, who see the deity as the controller of those diseases, will organize a festival to please or appease their deity.

In most villages the locally dominant castes would sponsor the village festival. For these festivals, each community performs a function similar to their traditional occupation: i.e. washermen provide cloths, acharis provide ladles for serving ''prasada'', each with a specified remuneration such as cash, land or share of the offerings. Others who are not involved in the setting up of the festival are encouraged to bring various offerings including goats and fowls for sacrifice. However all receive some of the good of pleasing the goddess. These festivals usually last one to two weeks and are chiefly marked by processions through the village. However Mines notes that these processions also mark the boundary between the ''ur'', or village and ''kadu'', or wilderness. These boundaries are subject to change depending on socioeconomic circumstances of residents of various areas in the village.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In Telugu regions, the festival begins with a beating of drums announcing the festival. Then the village elders along with the ''pujari'' arrive at the snake-hole and offer milk and eggs. They then tie two sticks together in front of the hole, a symbolic invitation of the goddess to arrive for the festival. The next day priests and village elders return to the snake hole. Two of the elders carry ''ghata'', pots decorated with various patterns and topped with an oil lamp. The one representing the goddess is covered with turmeric and ''kumkuma'' and draped with garlands of flowers. The priest carries a basket of cooked rice and lentils which represents the goddess. This food is offered to the snakes, and some soil from the hole, called ''putta bangaram'' ("golden soil"), is taken to symbolize the goddess' presence. The pots are then placed at the centre of the village next to a peepal tree or a specially-built ''pandal''. There the pot is kept along with the putta bangaram and worshipped throughout the rest of the festival. Over the next few days other ''ghata'' are taken around the village and households give gifts of rice and food and then brought back to the village centre, and occasionally a ram or boar is sacrificed. The villagers then perform many entertainments such as dances, dramas and others for the enjoyment of the goddess. On the seventh night is the ''pathana'', where farmers bring agricultural produce to be blessed by the goddess. The final day is the next day and is called ''toliyeru'', the tilling of the soil. Farmers, including the village headman, take their plows and plow the ground in front of the goddess to gain her blessing. The next morning is the ''anupu'' or ''anupukam'' (send-off), where a special anthropomorphic image made of either wood or stone is offered. In the evening the pot and ''putta bangaram'' are taken around the village accompanied by a man playing ''Poturaju''. Poturaju holds a rope and it is believed that those who are thrashed by him will have good luck. Then a female ''ganachari'', one possessed by the goddess, joins the procession generally in a state of unkemptness. Village elders then ask her whether there will be a good year ahead and the harvest will be bountiful. Finally the procession reaches the shrine of the goddess, where the animals are sacrificed. Their blood is then mixed with rice in a toddy pot to scare away evil spirits. Finally the wooden or clay image is led out of the village, sometimes to be placed in a tank where it will disintegrate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Similar procedures are followed in Karnataka, where the possession is an important aspect. The goddess will advise her devotees just like a mother or close friend.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Relationship with Vedic Hinduism ==
The Vedic and non-Vedic people assimilated from each other. Even though there are diversified characteristics between the Vedic and the folk tradition, various communities inducted these deities in their spectrum and created various ''sthalapuranas'' which emphasized the relation between these gods and goddesses from differing traditions. Often the Vedic deities were invoked to "legitimize" the lineage of the deity. In northern Tamil Nadu for instance, For example, a male deity called Kuttandavar is worshipped in many parts of Tamil Nadu, especially in the former [[South Arcot District (Madras Presidency)|South Arcot district]]. The image consists of a head like a big mask with a fierce face and lion's teeth projecting downwards outside the mouth. According to legend the creation of Kuttandavar, the god [[Indra]], is for the crime of murdering a Brahmin, became incarnated in the form of Kuttandavar, and a curse was laid upon him that his body leaving only the head. Another story, from Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh, is about Gangamma, the daughter of a Brahmin who unknowingly married a Dalit. This Dalit had claimed Brahmin status in order to learn the Vedas from Gangamma's father, but was unknowingly exposed by his mother who had visited. Ganga, distraught at being "polluted," burned herself to death, and her angry spirit cursed her husband and his mother to be reborn as a goat and sheep respectively, and to be sacrificed to her for all eternity. A similar myth was recorded in [[Kurnool district]] in the early 20th century for a goddess there.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This myth, by vilifying the Dalits as nothing more than animals, and portraying the Brahmins as innocent victims, is meant to show the "disastrous consequences" of transgressing one's caste and to uphold caste boundaries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Vedic deities and local village deities exist on multiple spectra, one of which is the Vedic idea of purity and pollution. However the most important contrast is the spectrum ranging from "soft" to "fierce." The "softest" deities are the Vedic deities: Vishnu, Shiva, and others, who are worshipped via vegetarian offerings solely. The fiercest deities are worshipped only through offerings of meat and alcohol, both considered "polluting" in Vedic scriptures. These are also the deities most commonly worshipped by Dalit communities, who often offer buffalos in Telugu and Kannada regions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Typically, the Vedic deities, although revered are seen as "big deities," concerned with the wider universe and not with the common man. The village deities, on the other hand, are accessible and are more concerned with the day-to-day woes of the villagers. Therefore, in times of need, it is the village deities that are turned to rather than the major Vedic deities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, their temples are usually maintained by donations from the people of the village and are in good condition, while Vedic temples are either administered by the government or often neglected due to lack of worship.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Many deities have made the transition from being independent folk deities worshipped with traditional rites to being assimilated as an avatara of one of the Vedic deities: it is believed that many of the most popular, such as Shiva, had non-Vedic origins. This often happens when a Vedic goddess (some form of Kali, Durga or Parvati usually) gains significant popularity and then all the gramadevatas are conflated with her. This process has resulted in many gramadevatas in the region around Hyderabad to be seen as avatars of Kali. Another way for the deities to make a transition is for a deity to gain significant popularity, thus ensuring they must be "legitimized." For instance, an army mason from [[Secunderabad]] became a devotee of Ujjain Mahankali and built a temporary temple for her. As the deity became more popular, she eventually got a permanent temple administered by his son and later a temple committee. During excavation they found an image of Manikyamba and installed it. They hired a Brahmin priest, and the Vedic ''chandi homam'' was done occasionally to ensure she became a Vedic deity who is largely peaceful. However she is also worshipped as a Neem tree in the temple courtyard and animal sacrifice is occasionally performed to her, showing her origin as a village deity. In addition, Yellamma is also worshipped here as a ''dasi'' (servant) of Mahankali, mirroring the relationship between Matangi and Yellamma. Yellamma, being a very popular goddess around Hyderabad, attracts many to the temple.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Assimilation ==
These transitions are primarily driven by a desire to assimilate into the dominant culture due to increased affluence. Because the Vedic religion is the "high" culture, when many from non-Vedic castes gain in affluence and status, they start to distance themselves from the "fierce" origins of their deities and assimilate them into the "superior" culture. Furthermore, when villages become absorbed by a city, their deities lose their agricultural significance, and so Vedic forms of worship are adopted. The form of the deity is also dependent on the primary adherents: for instance Sri Durgalamma in Visakhapatnam has been Sanskritised: Brahmin priests preside, animal sacrifices are not done inside the temple, and she is depicted with Vedic iconography, and is regarded as a peaceful avatara of [[Lakshmi]]. This is partly because the majority of devotees are middle-class housewives, to whom the beautiful consort of Vishnu is more palatable to worship than fearsome-looking Durga.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The syncretism of the practices of mainstream Hinduism with the deities of the folk religions have the effect of lending them legitimacy in the eyes of most adherents of the faith, offering them greater influence, attracting more popularity, and also replacing them outright by a foreign deity. For instance, with the syncretism of [[Ayyappan]] with mainstream Vaishnavism and Shaivism elevated him as an extremely popular deity beyond his native Kerala. 

The popular deities have evolved significantly over time. For example, Mariamman, another traditional folk deity, is highly influenced by the Vedic rituals. She is usually garlanded with skulls. But due to Vedic influence, the skull garland has been replaced by the lemon garland, and her malevolent appearance has been altered into a benevolent one. Sometimes, these processes of assimilation lead to the alteration of the deities. When the Brahmins stressed the holiness of the Vedic deities, they also denied the holiness of the deities of the folk tradition. They described the gods and goddesses of folk tradition either as subservient to Vedic deities, or they venerated these deities as capable of curing most potent contagious diseases. 

However, the process of inclusivism can also be seen in popular temples dedicated to the deities of folk religion. For example, the Mariamman temples of Samayapuram, Punnainallur, Vazhangaiman in Tamil Nadu attract a large number of devotees. These larger temples for traditionally non-Vedic deities in fact have Brahmin priests, who perform rituals as per Vedic customs: including turning Mariamman into a ''suddhadevata'' (vegetarian deity) and performing ''kumbhabhishekam''. With regard to the temples of folk tradition, Vinayakar, Murugan, Ayyappan and others, Vedic deities influence the deities of folk tradition such as Madurai Veeran and Karuppannasamy. The devotees of the folk tradition have begun to follow some customs and habits of higher castes in order to raise their social status, integrating them with the mainstream faith.

'''''Ap''''' (''{{IAST|áp-}}'') is the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] term for "water", which in [[Classical Sanskrit]] only occurs in the plural '''''{{IAST|āpas}}''''' (sometimes re-analysed as a thematic singular, ''{{IAST|āpa-}}''), whence [[Hindi]] '''''{{IAST|āp}}'''''. The term is from [[PIE]] {{PIE|''h&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;ap''}} "water".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The word has many cognates in archaic European toponyms, e.g., ''[[Messapia (disambiguation)|Mess-apia]]'', and perhaps also ''[[River Avon (disambiguation)|Avon]]'', from [[British language (Celtic)|Old Brythonic]] ''abona'' or Welsh ''[[afon]]'' ({{IPA-cy|ˈavɔn|pron}}), both meaning 'river'.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] word also survives as the [[Persian language|Persian]] word for water, ''āb'',  e.g. in ''[[Punjab region|Punjab]]'' (from ''panj-āb'' "five waters"). In archaic [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]ing contractions, the [[Laryngeal theory|laryngeal]] of the PIE root remains visible in Vedic Sanskrit, e.g. ''{{IAST|pratīpa-}}'' "against the current", from ''*{{PIE|proti-h&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;p-o-}}''. In [[Tamil language|Tamil]], Appu (Tamil form of "Ap") means water, and has references in poetry.

In the [[Rigveda]], several hymns are dedicated to "the waters" (''{{IAST|āpas}}''): 7.49, 10.9, 10.30, 10.137. In the oldest of these, 7.49, the waters are connected with the drought of [[Indra]].  [[Agni]], the god of fire, has a close association with water and is often referred to as ''[[Apam Napat|Apām Napāt]]'' "offspring of the waters". In Vedic astrology, the female deity Apah is the presiding deity of the [[Purva Ashadha]] [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]], meaning "first of the aṣāḍhā", with aṣāḍhā "the invincible one" being the name of the  greater constellation.

In [[Hindu philosophy]], the term refers to  [[water (classical element)|water as an element]], one of the ''[[Mahābhūta|Panchamahabhuta]],'' or "five great elements". In [[Hinduism]], it is also the name of the deva Varuna a [[personification]] of water, one of the [[Vasu]]s in most later [[Puranic]] lists.

      <text bytes="16617" xml:space="preserve">'''Waghoba''' (Marathi: वाघोबा) is an ancient tiger/leopard [[deity]] worshipped by a number of tribes in India for centuries. Depending on the region of [[India]], the deity is either described exclusively as a [[tiger]] or a [[leopard]] or as a deity that can take both forms. There are several temples for the deity throughout India.

== Etymology  ==
The name "Waghoba" is a combination of two [[Marathi language|Marathi]] words, "wagh" and "ba". "Wagh" means tiger and "ba" is a common suffix to indicate respect. The deity is called by different names in different Indian regions. Other names include "Waghya Dev", "Wagh Dev", or "Baghdev" where "Dev" means deity; "Waghro", which is used in parts of [[Maharashtra]] and Goa; and Bagheshwar, which is a combination of the [[Hindi]] words "Bagh" (tiger) and "Ishwar" (god).

== Iconography ==

The Waghoba idol has the form of a large cat. Typically carved in or out of stone or wood, the idol is occasionally decorated with vermilion paint and can be accompanied with corresponding religious symbols like the cobra, the sun, and the moon. 

The idol is frequently found in small temples dedicated to the Waghoba but can also be found in bigger temples dedicated to other deities. In bigger temples, the Waghoba idol is often found next to chief deity's idol and is therefore regarded as the 'Vahana' (vehicle) of the chief deity. Many of the Waghoba idols are hundreds of years old but are still regularly worshiped by Indian communities. These communities strongly believe that the Waghoba protects them and the jungle.

== Rituals ==

The worshiping ritual is performed differently, depending on each Indian region. In Maharashtra's [[Thane district]], some villages perform the rituals once a year on Kartik Barshi, which occurs twelve days after [[Diwali]], according to the [[Hindu calendar]]. The ceremony is performed by a Bhagat, a person who is assumed to be possessed by a god. Only men from the villages attend the rituals. The Bhagat puts ''Tilak'' (a mark on the forehead) on the Waghoba statue and offers ''Prasad'' (an offering to the deity that is later distributed among the devotees). In the evening, the villagers dance in praise of the Waghya Dev.  A Toran (festoon) is tied around the entire village to prevent the entry of leopards from another village...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In search of Waghoba |author1=Alissa Barnes |author2=Nikit Surve}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In Goa, the deity is called Waghro. The state has a few shrines of the deity with centuries-old idols. In the Goan village, Vagragal, the deity is worshiped by the Velip community twice a year: two days after Ashadi Poornima, which usually occurs in July, and two days after Holi Poornima, which usually occurs in March.  The one-hour ceremony is scheduled at 8 PM because the villagers believe that the Waghro's activities start at that time. The entire village gathers at the Waghro place to witness the rituals. It begins with the oiling of the idol and putting the 'Anant' flower on it as it is believed that the deity loves the flower. When the flower is not available, 'Anant' leaves and twigs are also used. Small offerings of rice and meat (probably wild pig) are put on banana leaves in a specific arrangement around the statue. Coconuts are broken in front of the idol. Some are placed next to it as an offering and some are later distributed among devotees as ''Prasad''.  Afterwards, as per their ''navas'' (vows to perform services for a god in return for a boon), some families behead roosters to offer their heads to the deity. The ritual ends with the priest praying for the well-being and safety of the villagers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Atul Arun|author2=Sinai Borkar|title=A report on big cat (vagh) worship in Goa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Tribes ==

Tribes, including the Bhaina, Bharia, Bhatra, Dangis, Gond, Gosain, Kol, Korku, Koshti, Velip, and Warli, are stout worshipers of Waghoba or Bagheshwar. They all bear a deep reverence towards the deity and have held strong beliefs about it for generations.

If a tiger takes away one of their cattle, they think there has been some neglect in their worship of him. They say that if one meets a tiger in the forest, he should fold his hands and bow down and say "Maharaj, let me pass" and the tiger will walk away. If a tiger is killed within the limits of the village, a Kathotia Kol will throw away all his earthen pots in mourning and shave his head and feed a few men of his sept.

If a tiger makes trouble, a stone is set up in his honor, and he receives a small offering.

If a Gond, when starting a journey in the morning, should meet a tiger, he should return and postpone his journey. But if he meets a tiger during the journey, it is considered good luck. Gonds think they can attain strength by carrying tigers' shoulder bones on their shoulders or by drinking the dust of tigers' bones pounded in water.

== Perceptions and myths about the large cats ==

People sharing space with the large cats have their own perceptions of the animals, some of which are scientifically correct while some others are myths. Nonetheless, it is extremely important how the people place the large cats in their cultural and physical space. A study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Monsters or Gods? Narratives of large cat worship in western India |author=Vidya Athreya |display-authors=et al. |journal=Cat News |issue=67 |date=Winter 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Maharashtra and Goa areas where Waghoba shrines are located revealed that people have remarkable understanding of leopards' biology and behaviour in their area, such as leopard cubs are born once in two years, they stay with their mother, each leopard has its own territory and scent marks its borders, they are nocturnal and they can climb on a tree easily. On the other hand, they also believed that leopard dispels bad omen. Once it tastes human blood, it becomes a man eater and the man eaters are gigantic creatures (even bigger than tigers). These are myths but perhaps are ways in which the people negotiate their space with these large cats.

== Beliefs ==

People believe in two types of leopards; one which lives in and always belongs to the forest and the other which have been released in the forest (by the forest department). The first type is scared of humans and runs away wherever it sees one while the other is an exact opposite of earlier. It is not scared of humans at all and sometimes even comes close to the villagers.

People sharing space with the leopards also noted that they are broadly scared of humans; however, they possess individual characteristics like boldness and shyness. Every leopard with territory near human settlement unfailingly comes close the houses in search of easy domestic prey.

== Discussion ==

A literature from the state of Gujarat mentions Dangis, an indigenous people from the Dang region of the state, revere Waghoba and have a wooden statue of the large cat in each of their villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shull E. M.|year=1968|title=Worship of Tiger-God and religious rituals associated among Dangi-Hill tribes of Dangs-district, Gujarat-State, Western India|journal=Eastern Anthropologist|volume=21|pages=201–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This illustrates how the same animal is viewed in different ways by different groups of people. Their views are framed by their cultural heritage which eventually defines their behaviour in a shared landscape. Research has shown that several communities sharing space with these animals often regard them as "protectors", "owners", "family" or "vehicle of the gods." The tigers of the [[Sundarbans]] are considered to be the owners of the forest and worshipped as "Banobibi/Dakkhinrai" by both Hindus and Muslims&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jalais A. |year=2008 |title=Unmasking the cosmopolitan tiger |journal=Nature and Culture |volume=3 |pages=25–40 |doi=10.3167/nc.2008.030103}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the tigers of Orissa are regarded as "Bagheshwar" and "Banjara" by the Santhals and the Kisans of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kanungo J. &amp; Kanungo L. 1998 |title=The Disappearing Mahal and Changing Directions of Worship in the Sunderbans |journal=India International Centre Quarterly |volume=25 |pages=47–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Garos of [[Meghalaya]], Gonds of Madhya Pradesh and Tulunadus of South Kanara district of Karnataka look upon the tiger as a protector. Garos wear necklace of the tiger claws embedded in gold or silver for protection and the Gonds carry the shoulder bone of the tiger believing it will bring them strength. The Irula tribe of Tamil Nadu also worships the tiger for protection from evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zvelebil K.V. |year=2000 |title=May the Gods Protect Us: A Contribution to Nilgiri Reli-gious Infrastructure |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=120 |pages=178–189 |doi=10.2307/605021|jstor=605021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dhangars, a pastoralist community in Maharashtra, also revere the tiger as "Waghdev/Waghjai" with the belief that the deity will protect their sheep from tigers and leopards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sontheimer G. D. |year=1947 |chapter=Some notes on Biroba, the Dhangar God of Maharashtra |title=In Science and Human Progress |publisher=Popular Prakashan |location=Bombay |pages=167–175 |edition=Kosambi D.D. Commemoration Volume}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gadgil M. &amp; Malhotra K. C. |year=1979 |title=Role of deities in symbolizing conflicts of Dispersing Human Groups |journal=Indian Anthropologists |volume=9 |pages=83–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study showed that the Mishmi tribe in the northeast India sees the tiger as their brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Aiyadurai A. |year=2016 |title='Tigers are Our Brothers': Understanding Human-Nature Relations in the Mishmi Hills, Northeast India |journal=Conservation and Society |volume=14 |pages=305–316 |issue=4| doi=10.4103/0972-4923.197614|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for a few exceptions like that of the Dhangars, these studies have no mention of Waghoba.

These beliefs and practices are not limited to India. These animals have been mentioned in traditional folklores of many cultures across the globe. Somewhere they have been referred to as benevolent gods and as malevolent agents in other cultures. The large cats have been integrated into the cultures via rituals, taboos, and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Newman P. |year=1961 |title=Tracking the Weretiger: Super natural man-eaters of India, China and Southeast Asia |publisher=McFarland &amp; Co. |location=London, UK |pages=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Saunders N. J. |year=1998 |title=Icons of power: feline symbolism in the Americas |publisher=Routledge |location=London |pages=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Tiger Compendium of 16th century China claims that tigers were both feared and revered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Coggins C. |year=2003 |title=The tiger and the pangolin: Nature, culture and conservation in China |pages=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these beliefs and practices are based in superstition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Saunders N. J. |year=1998 |title=Icons of power: feline symbolism in the Americas |publisher=Routledge |location=London |pages=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the interviews of the people who share space with the large cats and have temples in their area, reveal that they also have a sound knowledge of the animals' biology and the precautions that need to be taken to protect themselves from the leopard. Thus, the deity of Waghoba sets about an important discussion in the field of conservation. It sheds light on a different level of human-animal relationship. Such a relationship has been rarely explored in the field of wildlife conservation. 

Generally, there is a huge focus on the economic aspect of the "conflict" and the media also highlights such events in a sensational way. Such reporting could have serious ramifications on how policy is framed to deal with these otherwise complex interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hathaway R. S. |author2=Bryant A. M. |author3=Draheim M. M. |author4=Vinod P. |author5=Limaye S. |author6=Athreya V. |year=2017 |title=From fear to understanding: changes in media representations of leopard incidences after media awareness workshops in Mumbai, India |journal=Journal of Urban Ecology |volume=3 |pages=1–7 |doi=10.1093/jue/jux009|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recent studies that look into the social and cultural aspects of the interactions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ghosal S. &amp; Kjosavik D.

Today, because of various reasons, large carnivores are bound to increase their ranges into human dominated landscapes but conservationist and managers are unable to deal with the human dimension of the issue due to the negative narrative in the ecological sciences about human-large cat interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Carter N. H. |author2=Linnell J. D. C. |year=2016 |title=Co-Adaptation Is Key to Coexisting with Large Carnivores |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=31 |issue=8 |pages=575–578 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2016.05.006|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that positive interactions were prevalent long before the inception of wildlife conservation as a discipline, but these interactions have received little focus in mainstream studies. As the aim of conservation is to promote coexistence, we need to look beyond the negative aspect of the human-animal interactions and try to understand co-adaptation strategies that humans have developed over the centuries to survive and flourish with the large cats. The institution of Waghoba is also one such religious and cultural adaptation to coexist with these species.

'''Hinduism''' is the largest [[religion]] in the Indian subcontinent, and the third largest religion in the [[world]]. [[Hinduism]] has been called the "[[oldest religion]]" in the world, and many practitioners refer to Hinduism as "the eternal law" (''{{IAST|Sanātana Dharma}}'').{{sfn|Knott|1998|p=5}} Within this faith, there are four major traditions or denominations, namely, [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], [[Shaktism]], and [[Smarta tradition|Smartism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/162145884 |title=An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies |date=2007 |publisher=Liturgical Press |others=Orlando O.

{{main|Deva (Hinduism)|Devi}}
Deities in Hinduism are referred to as [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]] (masculine) and [[Devi]] (feminine).&lt;ref name=monierdevi&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary" Etymologically and Philologically Arranged to cognate Indo-European Languages, Motilal Banarsidass, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Stratton Hawley and Donna Marie Wulff (1998), Devi: Goddesses of India, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814912}}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William K Mahony (1997), The Artful Universe: An Introduction to the Vedic Religious Imagination, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791435809}}, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The root of these terms means "heavenly, divine, anything of excellence".&lt;ref name=monier&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary" Etymologically and Philologically Arranged to cognate Indo-European Languages, Motilal Banarsidass, p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;

In post-Vedic texts, such as the [[Puranas]] and the [[Itihasas]] of Hinduism, the Devas represent the good, and the Asuras the bad.&lt;ref name=nickgier/&gt;&lt;ref name=fowlergita/&gt; In some medieval Indian literature, ''Devas'' are also referred to as '''Suras''' and contrasted with their equally powerful, but malevolent [[half-brother]]s referred to as the Asuras.&lt;ref name=ang&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/40167/asura/40167rellinks/Related-Links Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu deities are part of '''Indian mythology''', both Devas and Devis feature in one of many cosmological theories in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;Don Handelman (2013), One God, Two Goddesses, Three Studies of South Indian Cosmology, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004256156}}, pp. 23-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger (1988), Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|978-0719018664}}, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics of Vedic-era deities===
In Vedic literature, Devas and Devis represent the forces of nature and some represent moral values (such as the [[Aditya]]s, [[Varuna]], and [[Mitra]]), each symbolizing the epitome of a specialized knowledge, creative energy, exalted and magical powers (''[[Siddhi]]s'').&lt;ref&gt;George Williams (2008), A Handbook of Hindu Mythology, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195332612}}, pp. 24-33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=binagupta&gt;Bina Gupta (2011), An Introduction to Indian Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415800037}}, pp. 21-25&lt;/ref&gt;

The most referred to Devas in the [[Rigveda]] are [[Indra]], [[Agni]] (fire) and [[Soma (deity)|Soma]], with "fire deity" called the friend of all humanity, it and Soma being the two celebrated in a [[yajna]] fire ritual that marks major Hindu ceremonies. [[Savitr]], [[Vishnu]], [[Rudra]] (later given the exclusive epithet of [[Shiva]]), and [[Prajapati]] (later [[Brahma]]) are gods and hence Devas.&lt;ref name=hajime26&gt;Hajime Nakamura (1998), A Comparative History of Ideas, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120810044}}, pp. 26-33&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vedas]] describes a number of significant Devis such as [[Ushas]] (dawn), [[Prithvi]] (earth), [[Aditi]] (cosmic moral order), [[Saraswati]] (river, knowledge), [[Vāc]] (sound), [[Nirṛti (goddess)|Nirṛti]] (destruction), [[Ratri]] (night), [[Aranyani]] (forest), and bounty goddesses such as Dinsana, Raka, Puramdhi, Parendi, Bharati, Mahi among others are mentioned in the ''[[Rigveda]]''.&lt;ref name=kinsley717&gt;David Kinsley (2005), Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-8120803947}}, pp. 6-17, 55-64&lt;/ref&gt; Sri, also called Lakshmi, appears in late Vedic texts dated to be pre-Buddhist, but verses dedicated to her do not suggest that her characteristics were fully developed in the Vedic era.&lt;ref name=kinsley18&gt;David Kinsley (2005), Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-8120803947}}, pp. 18, 19&lt;/ref&gt; All gods and goddesses are distinguished in the Vedic times, but in the post-Vedic texts (~500 BCE to 200 CE), and particularly in the early medieval era literature, they are ultimately seen as aspects or manifestations of one [[Brahman]], the Supreme power.&lt;ref name=kinsley18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher John Fuller (2004), The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691120485}}, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Ananda Coomaraswamy states that Devas and Asuras in the Vedic lore are similar to [[Twelve Olympians|Angels-Theoi-Gods]] and [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] of Greek mythology, both are powerful but have different orientations and inclinations, the Devas representing the powers of Light and the Asuras representing the powers of Darkness in Hindu mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; According to Coomaraswamy's interpretation of Devas and Asuras, both these natures exist in each human being, the tyrant and the angel is within each being, the best and the worst within each person struggles before choices and one's own nature, and the Hindu formulation of Devas and Asuras is an eternal dance between these within each person.&lt;ref&gt;Ananda Coomaraswamy (1935), "Angel and Titan: An Essay in Vedic Ontology", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', volume 55, pp. 373–418&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gier&gt;Nicholas Gier (1995), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1399510 Hindu Titanism], Philosophy East and West, Volume 45, Number 1, p. 76, see also 73-96&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
The Devas and Asuras, Angels and Titans, powers of Light and powers of Darkness in Rigveda, although distinct and opposite in operation, are in essence consubstantial, their distinction being a matter not of essence but of orientation, revolution or transformation. In this case, the Titan is potentially an Angel, the Angel still by nature a Titan; the Darkness in ''actu'' is Light, the Light in ''potentia'' Darkness; whence the designations Asura and Deva may be applied to one and the same Person according to the mode of operation, as in Rigveda 1.163.3, "Trita art thou (Agni) by interior operation".

In the [[Puranas]] and the [[Itihasas]] with the embedded Bhagavad Gita, the Devas represent the good, and the Asuras the bad.&lt;ref name="nickgier"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fowlergita/&gt; According to the [[Bhagavad Gita]] (16.6–16.7), all beings in the universe have both the divine qualities (''daivi sampad'') and the demonic qualities (''asuri sampad'') within each.&lt;ref name=fowlergita/&gt;&lt;ref name=chrischapple/&gt; The sixteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita states that pure god-like saints are rare and pure demon-like evil are rare among human beings, and the bulk of humanity is multi-charactered with a few or many faults.&lt;ref name=fowlergita/&gt; According to Jeaneane Fowler, the Gita states that desires, aversions, greed, needs, emotions in various forms "are facets of ordinary lives", and it is only when they turn to lust, hate, cravings, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness, hypocrisy, violence, cruelty and such negativity- and destruction-inclined that natural human inclinations metamorphose into something demonic (Asura).&lt;ref name="fowlergita"/&gt;&lt;ref name=chrischapple&gt;Christopher K Chapple (2010), The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438428420}}, pp. 610-629&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===
Edelmann states that gods and anti-gods of Hinduism are symbolism for spiritual concepts. For example, god Indra (a Deva) and the antigod Virocana (an Asura) question a sage for insights into the knowledge of the self.&lt;ref name=edelmann14/&gt; Virocana leaves with the first given answer, believing now he can use the knowledge as a weapon. In contrast, Indra keeps pressing the sage, churning the ideas, and learning about means to inner happiness and power. Edelmann suggests that the Deva-Asura dichotomies in Hindu mythology may be seen as "narrative depictions of tendencies within our selves".&lt;ref name=edelmann14&gt;Jonathan Edelmann (2013), Hindu Theology as Churning the Latent, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Volume 81, Issue 2, pp. 439-441&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu deities in Vedic era, states Mahoney, are those artists with "powerfully inward transformative, effective and creative mental powers".&lt;ref&gt;William K Mahony (1997), The Artful Universe: An Introduction to the Vedic Religious Imagination, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791435809}}, pp. 17, 27, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hindu mythology, everyone starts as an Asura, born of the same father. "Asuras who remain Asura" share the character of powerful beings craving for more power, more wealth, ego, anger, unprincipled nature, force and violence.&lt;ref name=gierasurach/&gt;&lt;ref name=stellaray/&gt; The "Asuras who become Devas" in contrast are driven by an inner voice, seek understanding and meaning, prefer moderation, principled behavior, aligned with ''[[Ṛta]]'' and ''[[Dharma]]'', knowledge and harmony.&lt;ref name=gierasurach&gt;Nicholas Gier (1995), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1399510 Hindu Titanism], Philosophy East and West, Volume 45, Number 1, pp. 76-80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stellaray&gt;Stella Kramrisch and Raymond Burnier (1986), The Hindu Temple, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802230}}, pp. 75-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William K Mahony (1997), The Artful Universe: An Introduction to the Vedic Religious Imagination, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791435809}}, pp. 50, 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

The god (Deva) and antigod (Asura), states Edelmann, are also symbolically the contradictory forces that motivate each individual and people, and thus Deva-Asura dichotomy is a spiritual concept rather than mere genealogical category or species of being.&lt;ref name=edelmann13/&gt; In the Bhāgavata Purana, saints and gods are born in families of Asuras, such as [[Mahabali]] and [[Prahlada]], conveying the symbolism that motivations, beliefs and actions rather than one's birth and family circumstances define whether one is Deva-like or Asura-like.&lt;ref name=edelmann13&gt;Jonathan Edelmann (2013), Hindu Theology as Churning the Latent, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Volume 81, Issue 2, pp. 440-442&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ishvara==
{{main|Ishvara}}
[[File:Surya Majapahit Diagram.svg|thumb|Ishvara is, along with Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma, one of the 17 deities commonly found in Indonesian [[Surya Majapahit]] Hindu arts and records. However, Ishvara represents different concept in various Hindu philosophies.]]
Another Hindu term that is sometimes translated as deity is [[Ishvara]], or alternatively various deities are described, state Sorajjakool et al., as "the personifications of various aspects of one and the same Ishvara".&lt;ref&gt;Siroj Sorajjakool, Mark Carr and Julius Nam (2009), World Religions, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0789038135}}, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Ishvara'' has a wide range of meanings that depend on the era and the school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=mmwizvara&gt;Monier Williams, Sanskrit-English dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/mwquery/ Izvara], Sanskrit Digital Lexicon, University of Cologne, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Ishvara", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=riepe&gt;Dale Riepe (1961, Reprinted 1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pp. 177-184, 208-215&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient texts of Indian philosophy, ''Ishvara'' means supreme Self, [[Brahman]] (Highest Reality), ruler, king or husband depending on the context.&lt;ref name=mmwizvara/&gt; In medieval era texts, ''Ishvara'' means God, Supreme Being, personal god, or special Self depending on the school of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=mirceaelaide73&gt;Mircea Eliade (2009), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691142036}}, pp. 73-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=riepe/&gt;&lt;ref name=ianw&gt;Ian Whicher, The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana, State University of New York press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, pp. 82-86&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the six systems of [[Hindu philosophy]], [[Samkhya]] and [[Mimamsa]] do not consider the concept of ''Ishvara'', i.e., a supreme being, relevant. [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Vedanta]] and [[Nyaya]] schools of Hinduism discuss Ishvara, but assign different meanings.

Early Nyaya school scholars considered the hypothesis of a deity as a creator God with the power to grant blessings, boons and fruits; but these early Nyaya scholars then rejected this hypothesis, and were non-theistic or atheists.&lt;ref name="John Clayton 2010 page 150"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G Oberhammer (1965), Zum problem des Gottesbeweises in der Indischen Philosophie, Numen, 12: 1-34&lt;/ref&gt; Later scholars of Nyaya school reconsidered this question and offered counter arguments for what is Ishvara and various arguments to prove the existence of omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent deity (God).&lt;ref name=fxc&gt;Francis X. Clooney (2010), Hindu God, Christian God: How Reason Helps Break Down the Boundaries, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199738724}}, pp. 18-19, 35-39&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaisheshika school of Hinduism, as founded by Kanada in 1st millennium BCE, neither required nor relied on creator deity.&lt;ref name=klausk&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (2007), A Survey of Hinduism, Third Edition, State University of New York, {{ISBN|978-0791470824}}, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Goel (1984), Indian philosophy: Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika and modern science, Sterling, {{ISBN|978-0865902787}}, pp. 149-151&lt;/ref&gt; Later Vaisheshika school adopted the concept of ''Ishvara'', states [[Klaus Klostermaier]], but as an eternal God who co-exists in the universe with eternal substances and atoms, but He "winds up the clock, and lets it run its course".&lt;ref name=klausk/&gt;

Ancient Mimamsa scholars of Hinduism questioned what is ''Ishvara'' (deity, God)?&lt;ref name=fxc3&gt;FX Clooney (1997), What's a god? The quest for the right understanding of devatā in Brāhmaṅical ritual theory (Mīmāṃsā), International Journal of Hindu Studies, August 1997, Volume 1, Issue 2, pp. 337-385&lt;/ref&gt; They considered a deity concept unnecessary for a consistent philosophy and [[moksha]] (soteriology).&lt;ref name=fxc3/&gt;&lt;ref name=bilimoria&gt;P.

In Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, ''Isvara'' is neither a creator-God, nor a savior-God.&lt;ref&gt;A Malinar (2014), Current Approaches: Articles on Key Themes, in The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies (Editor: Jessica Frazier), Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1472511515}}, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; This is called one of the several major atheistic schools of Hinduism by some scholars.&lt;ref name=lpfl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415648875}}, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Garbe (2013), Die Samkhya-Philosophie, Indische Philosophie Volume 11, {{ISBN|978-1484030615}}, pp. 25-27 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[:no:Knut A.

In Yoga school of Hinduism, it is any "personal deity" (Ishta Deva or Ishta Devata)&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Espín and James Nickoloff (2007), An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies, Liturgical Press, {{ISBN|978-0814658567}}, p. 651&lt;/ref&gt; or "spiritual inspiration", but not a creator God.&lt;ref name=ianw/&gt;&lt;ref name=lpfl&gt;Lloyd Pflueger, Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; Whicher explains that while Patanjali's terse verses in the Yogasutras can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patanjali's concept of ''Isvara'' in Yoga philosophy functions as a "transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin on the path to spiritual emancipation".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Whicher (1999), The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791438152}}, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that all deities are truly one is, moreover, easily extended to proclaim that all human beings are in reality also forms of one supreme deity - Brahman, the Absolute of philosophical Hinduism. In practice, this abstract monist doctrine rarely belongs to an ordinary Hindu's statements, but examples of permeability between the divine and human can be easily found in popular Hinduism in many unremarkable contexts".&lt;/ref&gt; Parallels between Allah in Islam or Ein Sof in Kabbalah and Brahman have been drawn by many scholars in the past as well as in recent times.

Hinduism has an ancient and extensive iconography tradition, particularly in the form of ''Murti'' ([[Sanskrit]]: मूर्ति, IAST: Mūrti), or ''Vigraha'' or ''Pratima''.&lt;ref name="pratima Hinduism"/&gt; A ''Murti'' is itself not the god in [[Hinduism]], but it is an image of god and represents emotional and religious value.&lt;ref name=fowler41&gt;Jeaneane D Fowler (1996), Hinduism: Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723608}}, pp. 41-45&lt;/ref&gt; A literal translation of ''Murti'' as idol is incorrect, states Jeaneane Fowler, when idol is understood as superstitious end in itself.&lt;ref name=fowler41/&gt; Just like the photograph of a person is not the real person, a ''Murti'' is an image in Hinduism but not the real thing, but in both cases the image reminds of something of emotional and real value to the viewer.&lt;ref name=fowler41/&gt; When a person worships a ''Murti'', it is assumed to be a manifestation of the essence or spirit of the deity, the worshipper's spiritual ideas and needs are meditated through it, yet the idea of ultimate reality or [[Brahman]] is not confined in it.&lt;ref name=fowler41/&gt;

A Murti of a Hindu deity is typically made by carving stone, wood working, metal casting or through pottery. Medieval era texts describing their proper proportions, positions and gestures include the [[Puranas]], [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] and [[Samhita]]s particularly the [[Shilpa Shastras]].&lt;ref name="klausklost264"/&gt; The expressions in a ''Murti'' vary in diverse Hindu traditions, ranging from ''Ugra'' symbolism to express destruction, fear and violence ([[Durga]], [[Parvati]], [[Kali]]), as well as ''Saumya'' symbolism to express joy, knowledge and harmony (Parvati, Saraswati, Lakshmi). Saumya images are most common in [[Hindu temple]]s.&lt;ref name=grao17&gt;Gopinath Rao, [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924071128825#page/n61/mode/2up Elements of Hindu Iconography] Madras, Cornell University Archives, pp. 17-39&lt;/ref&gt; Other Murti forms found in Hinduism include the [[Linga]].&lt;ref name=stella179&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1994), The Presence of Siva, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691019307}}, pp. 179-187&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hinduism, deities and their icons may be hosted in a [[Hindu temple]], within a home or as an amulet. The worship performed by Hindus is known by a number of regional names, such as ''Puja''.&lt;ref name=lochtefeldpuja/&gt; This practice in front of a [[murti]] may be elaborate in large temples, or be a simple song or mantra muttered in home, or offering made to sunrise or river or symbolic anicon of a deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flood|first=Gavin D.|title=The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2002|isbn=978-0-631-21535-6|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Courtright (1985), in ''Gods of Flesh/Gods of Stone'' (Joanne Punzo Waghorne, Norman Cutler, and Vasudha Narayanan, eds), {{ISBN|978-0231107778}}, Columbia University Press, see Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Galepuja"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gale Encyclopedia of Religion|pages=7493–7495|editor=Lindsay Jones|publisher=Thompson Gale|year=2005|volume=11|isbn=0-02-865980-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence of deity worship in Hindu temples trace ''Puja'' rituals to [[Gupta Empire]] era (~4th century CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael D. |last=Willis |title=The Archaeology of Hindu Ritual |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year= 2009 |chapter= 2: 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Michael D. |last=Willis  |title=The Formation of Temple Ritual in the Gupta Period: pūjā and pañcamahāyajña |journal=Prajñādhara: Gouriswar Bhattacharya Felicitation Volume, Edited by Gerd Mevissen | publisher= Gerd Mevissen |year=2008 |url= https://www.academia.edu/2069840}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hindu temples, various pujas may be performed daily at various times of the day; in other temples, it may be occasional.&lt;ref name=ebp&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/483030/puja Puja], Encyclopædia Britannica (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hgb&gt;Hiro G. Badlani (2008), ''Hinduism: A path of ancient wisdom'', {{ISBN|978-0595436361}}, pp. 315-318&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Puja'' practice is structured as an act of welcoming, hosting, honoring the deity of one's choice as one's honored guest,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Thieme (1984), "Indische Wörter und Sitten," in ''Kleine Schriften'', Vol. 2, pp. 343–370&lt;/ref&gt; and remembering the spiritual and emotional significance the deity represents to the devotee.&lt;ref name=fowler41/&gt;&lt;ref name=lochtefeldpuja&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), ''Puja'' in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 2, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-823922871}}, pp. 529–530&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan Gonda]], as well as [[Diana L. Eck]], states that a typical ''Puja'' involves one or more of 16 steps (''Shodasha Upachara'') traceable to ancient times: the deity is invited as a guest, the devotee hosts and takes care of the deity as an honored guest, praise (hymns) with [[Dhupa]] or [[Aarti]] along with food ([[Naivedhya]]) is offered to the deity, after an expression of love and respect the host takes leave, and with affection expresses good bye to the deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fuller|first=C.

Deity worship (''[[Bhakti]]''), visiting temples and ''Puja'' rites are not mandatory and is optional in Hinduism; it is the choice of a Hindu, it may be a routine daily affair for some Hindus, periodic ritual or infrequent for some.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lee and Kathleen Nadeau (2010), Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife, Volume 1, ABC, {{ISBN|978-0313350665}}, pp. 480-481&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Holm and John Bowker (1998), Worship, Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1855671119}}, p. 83, '''Quote:''' "Temples are the permanent residence of a deity and daily worship is performed by the priest, but the majority of Hindus visit temples only on special occasions.

Major deities have inspired a vast genre of literature such as the [[Puranas]] and [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agama]] texts as well their own Hindu traditions, but with shared [[mythology]], ritual grammar, [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]], [[axiology]] and polycentrism.&lt;ref name=juliuslipner371/&gt;&lt;ref name=frazierintrop2/&gt; Vishnu and his avatars are at the foundation of [[Vaishnavism]], Shiva for [[Shaivism]], Devi for [[Shaktism]], and some Hindu traditions such as Smarta traditions who revere multiple major deities (five) as henotheistic manifestations of [[Brahman]] (absolute metaphysical Reality).&lt;ref name=lawrence78&gt;David Lawrence (2012), The Routledge Companion to Theism (Editors: Charles Taliaferro, Victoria S. Harrison and Stewart Goetz), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415881647}}, pp. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guy Beck (2005), Alternative Krishnas: Regional and Vernacular Variations on a Hindu Deity, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|978-0791464151}}, pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Editors of Hinduism Today|title=What is Hinduism?|last=Editors of Hinduism Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XC9bwMMPcwC&amp;pg=PA27|work=Himalayan Academy Publications|year=2007|isbn=9781934145272|access-date=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are diverse deities in Hinduism, states Lawrence, "Exclusivism – which maintains that only one's own deity is real" is rare in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=lawrence78/&gt; [[Julius J. Lipner|Julius Lipner]], and other scholars, state that pluralism and "polycentrism" – where other deities are recognized and revered by members of different "denominations", has been the Hindu ethos and way of life.&lt;ref name=juliuslipner371/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, pp. 167-168&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trimurti and Tridevi===
{{main|Trimurti|Tridevi}}
[[File:The Hindu Gods Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma LACMA M.86.337 (1 of 12).jpg|350px|thumb|A 10th century triad – Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma – from [[Bihar]].]]
The concept of Triad (or ''Trimurti'', ''Trinity'') makes a relatively late appearance in Hindu literature, or in the second half of 1st millennium BCE.&lt;ref name=jangondatrim&gt;Jan Gonda (1969), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40457085 The Hindu Trinity], Anthropos, 63/64, 1/2, pp. 212-226&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of triad, playing three roles in the cosmic affairs, is typically associated with Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva (also called ''Mahesh''); however, this is not the only triad in Hindu literature.&lt;ref name=baileytrim&gt;GM Bailey (1979), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269716 Trifunctional Elements in the Mythology of the Hindu Trimūrti], Numen, Vol. 26, Fasc. 2, pp. 152-163&lt;/ref&gt; Other triads include ''Tridevi'', of three goddesses – Lakshmi, Saraswati and Parvati in the text [[Devi Mahatmya]], in the Shakta tradition, who further assert that Devi is the [[Brahman]] (Ultimate Reality) and it is her energy that empowers Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.&lt;ref name=jangondatrim/&gt; The other triads, formulated as deities in ancient Indian literature, include Sun (creator), Air (sustainer) and Fire (destroyer); Prana (creator), Food (sustainer) and Time (destroyer).&lt;ref name=jangondatrim/&gt; These triads, states [[Jan Gonda]], are in some mythologies grouped together without forming a Trinity, and in other times represented as equal, a unity and manifestations of one Brahman.&lt;ref name=jangondatrim/&gt; In the Puranas, for example, this idea of threefold "hypostatization" is expressed as follows,

{{Quote|
They [Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva] exist through each other, and uphold each other; they are parts of one another; they subsist through one another; they are not for a moment separated; they never abandon one another.
|[[Vayu Purana]]|5.17, Translated by Jan Gonda&lt;ref name=jangondatrim/&gt;}}

The triad appears in [[Maitrayaniya Upanishad]], for the first time in recognized roles known ever since, where they are deployed to present the concept of three [[Guṇa]] – the innate nature, tendencies and inner forces found within every being and everything, whose balance transform and keeps changing the individual and the world.&lt;ref name=baileytrim/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James G. Lochtefeld, Guna, in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Vol. 1, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|9780823931798}}, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the medieval Puranic texts, ''Trimurti'' concepts appears in various context, from rituals to spiritual concepts.&lt;ref name=jangondatrim/&gt; The Bhagavad Gita, in verses 9.18, 10.21-23 and 11.15, asserts that the triad or trinity is manifestation of one Brahman, which Krishna affirms himself to be.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf V D'Souza (1996), The Bhagavadgītā and St. John of the Cross, Gregorian University, {{ISBN|978-8876526992}}, pp. 340-342&lt;/ref&gt; However, suggests Bailey, the mythology of triad is "not the influence nor the most important one" in Hindu traditions, rather the ideologies and spiritual concepts develop on their own foundations.&lt;ref name=baileytrim/&gt; The triad, with Brahma creating, Vishnu preserving and Shiva destroying, balances the functioning of the whole universe.

===Avatars of Hindu deities===

{{main|Avatar|Dashavatara}}
Hindu mythology has nurtured the concept of Avatar, which represents the descent of a deity on earth.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeld72&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, The Rosen Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-0-8239-3180-4}}, pp. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheth98"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1353/pew.2002.0005|last=Sheth|first=Noel|date=Jan 2002|title=Hindu Avatāra and Christian Incarnation: A Comparison| journal=Philosophy East and West|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press |volume=52|issue=1 (Jan. 2002)|pages=98–125|jstor=1400135|s2cid=170278631}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is commonly translated as "[[incarnation]]",&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeld72/&gt; and is an "appearance" or "manifestation".&lt;ref name="Matchett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matchett|first=Freda|title=Krishna, Lord or Avatara?: the relationship between Krishna and Vishnu|publisher=9780700712816|year=2001|page=4 | isbn=978-0-7007-1281-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hugh Partridge]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=7lEFyGiP5r8C&amp;pg=PA148&amp;f=false Introduction to World Religions], pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Avatar is most developed in [[Vaishnavism]] tradition, and associated with [[Vishnu]], particularly with [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinsley|first=David|title=Gale's Encyclopedia of Religion|editor=Lindsay Jones|publisher=Thomson Gale|year=2005|edition=Second|volume=2|pages=707–708|isbn=0-02-865735-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant18"&gt;{{cite book| last=Bryant| first=Edwin Francis|title=Krishna: A Sourcebook| publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2007| page=18 | isbn=978-0-19-514891-6| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0z02cZe8PU8C&amp;pg=PT32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishnu takes numerous avatars in Hindu mythology. He becomes female, during the [[Samudra manthan]], in the form of [[Mohini]], to resolve a conflict between the Devas and [[Asura (Hinduism)|Asura]]s. His male avatars include [[Matsya]], [[Kurma]], [[Varaha]], [[Narasimha]], [[Vamana]], [[Parashurama]], [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Gautama Buddha in Hinduism|Buddha]], and [[Kalki]].&lt;ref name="Bryant18"/&gt; Various texts, particularly the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', discuss the idea of Avatar of Vishnu appearing to restore the cosmic balance whenever the power of evil becomes excessive and causes persistent oppression in the world.&lt;ref name="Sheth98"/&gt;

In [[Shaktism]] traditions, the concept appears in its legends as the various manifestations of [[Devi]], the Divine Mother principal in Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Hawley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawley|first=John Stratton|author2=Vasudha Narayanan|title=The life of Hinduism|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|page=174|isbn=978-0-520-24914-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7DLj1tYmoTQC&amp;pg=PA174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The avatars of Devi or Parvati include [[Durga]] and [[Kali]], who are particularly revered in eastern states of [[India]], as well as Tantra traditions.&lt;ref&gt;David Kinsley (1988), Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520063392}}, pp. 45-48, 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sally Kempton (2013), Awakening Shakti: The Transformative Power of the Goddesses of Yoga, {{ISBN|978-1604078916}}, pp. 165-167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jansen134&gt;Eva Rudy Jansen, The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning, Holland: Binkey Kok, {{ISBN|978-9074597074}}, pp. 133-134, 41&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty one avatars of Shiva are also described in [[Shaivism]] texts, but unlike Vaishnava traditions, Shaiva traditions have focussed directly on Shiva rather than the Avatar concept.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeld72/&gt;

[[File:Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma Adoring Kali LACMA M.80.101 (3 of 7).jpg|thumb|Kali on a cremation pyre]]
'''''Shmashana Adhipati''''' is a name given to a deity either male or female and also together as a consort, who rules [[Shmashana]], cremation ground. The Shamashana Adhipati literally translates to Lord of Shmashana. The name ''Shmashan Adhipathi'' is given to different deities in [[Hinduism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

==In Hinduism==

[[Shiva]] is considered to be Lord of Shmashana or ''Shmashana Adhipati''. One epithet for Shiva is "inhabitant of the cremation ground" (Sanskrit: śmaśānavāsin, also spelled Shmashanavasin), referring to this connection.&lt;ref&gt;Chidbhavananda, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kali]], his consort is known by another name ''Shmashana Kali''. Kali's association with blackness stands in contrast to her consort, Shiva, whose body is covered by the white ashes of the cremation ground in which he meditates, and with which Kali is also associated, as Shmashana Kali is also a protector. She can be used to chase away bad spirits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiadivine.org/audarya/shakti-sadhana/207648-shmashana-kali.html] Shamshana Kali&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, together Shiva and Kali are they deity associated with Shmashana as per Hindu religion are called Shmashana Adhipati. Also [[Bhairava]], another manifestation of [[Shiva]] and his consort [[Bhairavi]] are said to live in Shmashana. The [[Mahavidya]] goddesses of Hindu and Tantric cult are said to rule over Smashan.

In [[Tantra|Tantrik]] cult, Shmashana, emerged to be a main area of their experiments called [[Shava sadhana]].&lt;ref&gt;Sacred to profane: Anjum Katyal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Logic in a popular form:essays on popular religion in Bengal by Sumanta Banerjee&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aghori]]s and [[Kapalika]] are some of the people who indulge in such rituals in Shmashana. They invoke  [[Kali]], [[Tara (Devi)|Tara]], [[Yogini]], [[Chausath Jogini Temple|Chausath Yogini]], [[Dakini]], [[Bhairava]], [[Bhairavi]] and ghosts like [[Vetala]], [[Pishacha]], [[Brahm Rakshas|Brahm-Rakshasha]] and worship them, give them sacrifices in Shmashana to have occult powers. They consider these deities as ''Shmashana Adhipati''.

==In Tibetan Buddhism==
[[File:Citipati-buddhist-deity.jpg|thumb|Chitipati as a skeletal deity pair]]
Further, as per [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] script a couple known as ''Shmashana Adhipati'' ([[Standard Tibetan]]: pal dur tro dag po yab yum. English: the Glorious Lords of the Charnel Ground - Father-Mother) also called ''[[Citipati (Buddhism)|Chitipati]]'' is considered Lord of Shmashana. They arise from the ''Secret Essence Wheel Tantra'' and is associated with the collection/cycle of [[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra]]. Primarily employed as a wealth practice, with emphasis on protecting from thieves, they also serve as the special protector for the [[Vajrayogini]] 'Naro Khechari' practice. Shri Shmashana Adhipati is now common, to a greater or lesser extent, in all the New (Sarma) Schools of Himalayan and Tibetan influenced Buddhism. It is important not to confuse the protector deities Shri Shmashana Adhipati, Father &amp; Mother, with the skeleton dancers found in the various systems of Tibetan religious Cham dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himalayanart.org/search/set.cfm?setID=160 Buddhist Protector: Shmashana Adhipati (Chitipati)]&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Chitipati''  again has its origin from word ''Chita'' (funeral [[pyre]] as per [[Hindu]] rites). 

[[Dakini]], [[Shakini]] and some other [[Tantra|tantric]] deities, associated both with [[Hinduism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], are said to roam in [[Shmashana]].

The '''yakshas''' ({{lang-sa|यक्ष}} {{lang|sa-Latn|yakṣa}}; {{lang-pi|yakkha|i=yes}}) are a broad class of nature-spirits, usually benevolent, but sometimes mischievous or capricious, connected with water, fertility, trees, the forest, treasure and wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singh |title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India |date=2008 |publisher=Pearson Education |location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-317-1120-0|page=430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Stefon|first=Matt|title=Yaksha {{!}} Hindu mythology|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/yaksha|url-status=live|access-date=15 July 2007|website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appear in [[Hindu texts|Hindu]], [[Jainism|Jain]] and [[Buddhist texts]], as well as ancient and medieval era temples of [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] as guardian deities.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard John Richards|title=South-east Asian Ceramics: Thai, Vietnamese, and Khmer: From the Collection of the Art Gallery of South Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0DWAAAAMAAJ |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-967-65-3075-2 |pages=27, 67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feminine form of the word is '''{{IAST|yakṣī}}'''&lt;ref&gt;For {{lang|sa|यक्षी}} as the feminine of {{lang|sa|यक्षः}} see V. S. Apte, ''The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary'', p. 776.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''[[yakshini]]''''' ({{lang-sa|यक्षिणी}} {{lang|sa-Latn|yakṣiṇī}}; [[Pali]]:Yakkhini).&lt;ref&gt;For yakṣiṇī ({{lang|sa|यक्षिणी}}) as a regular Sanskrit term for a female yakṣa, and yakṣaṇī as a Buddhist variant,  see [[Franklin Edgerton]], ''Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Grammar and Dictionary'', Vol. 2, Motilal Banarsidass, first Ed., 1953, p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hindu, Jain and Buddhist texts, the {{IAST|yakṣa}} has a dual personality. On the one hand, a {{IAST|yakṣa}} may be an inoffensive nature-[[fairy]], associated with woods and mountains; but there is also a darker version of the {{IAST|yakṣa}}, which is a kind of ghost ([[bhoot (ghost)|bhuta]]) that haunts the wilderness and waylays and devours travellers, similar to the [[rakshasa|{{IAST|rakṣasas}}]].

They are variously dated from around the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century BCE. These statues are monumental (usually around 2 metres tall), and often bear inscriptions related to their identification as yakshas. They are considered as the first known monumental stone sculptures in India. Two of these monumental yakshas are known from [[Patna]], one from [[Vidisha]] and one from [[Parkham, Uttar-Pradesh|Parkham]], as well as one yakshini from Vidisha. The {{IAST|yakṣas}} may have originally been the [[tutelary deity]] of a city, district, lake, or well. Their worship, together with popular belief in [[Nāga|nagas]] (serpent deities), feminine fertility deities, and mother goddesses, may have had its origin among the early Hindu people of India. Yaksha worship coexisted with the priest-conducted sacrifices of the Vedic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=yaksha {{!}} Hindu mythology {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/yaksha |access-date=9 April 2022 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were later viewed as the steward deities of the earth and the wealth buried beneath.&lt;ref name="RDeC"&gt;{{cite book|title=Haunting the Buddha: Indian Popular Religions and the Formation of Buddhism|last=DeCaroli|first=Robert|year=2004|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], US| isbn=978-0-19-516838-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kubera===
[[File:Kubera, the God of Riches LACMA M.69.13.8 (1 of 9).jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Kubera, the God of Riches, [[LACMA]]]]
{{Main|Kubera}}
In Hindu, Buddhist and Jain Religion, [[Kubera]], the god of wealth and prosperity, is considered the king of the yakshas. He is regarded as the regent of the North ([[Guardians of the directions|Dikapāla]]) and a protector of the world ([[Lokapala|Lokapāla]]).

His many epithets{{For example?|date=August 2019}} extol him as the overlord of numerous semi-divine species and the owner of the treasures of the world. Kubera is often depicted with a plump body, adorned with jewels, carrying a money-pot and a club. His [[vahana]] (vehicle) is the [[Viverrinae|mongoose]]. He is often seen with [[Lakshmi]], the Hindu goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity.

In Buddhism, he is equated with [[Vaiśravaṇa]].

[[File:Scroll painting of Atavaka, Unknown Artist, Japan, 14th century.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Painting of [[Āṭavaka]], a yaksha who challenged the Buddha]]

In Buddhist literature, the {{IAST|yakṣa}} are the attendants of [[Vaiśravaṇa]], the guardian of the northern quarter, a beneficent [[deva (Buddhism)|god]] who protects the righteous. The term also refers to the [[Twelve Heavenly Generals]] who guard [[Bhaisajyaguru|{{IAST|Bhaiṣajyaguru}}]], the Medicine Buddha. The yakshas of many Buddhist stories are ugly ogres, reborn in that form because of sins committed during their past lives as humans.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bhairav|first1=J.

One such malevolent yaksha, Silesaloma, appears in the [[Jataka tales]] of the [[Pali]] Buddhist canon. In the story "Prince Five-Weapons and the Sticky-Haired Demon",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Prince Five-Weapons and Sticky-Hair|url=https://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bt_5.htm|website=Buddhist Studies: Buddha Dharma Education Association &amp; BuddhaNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silesaloma is described as being the height of a palm tree, with sharp teeth and two yellow tusks, and a coat of thick, matted fur. A [[bodhisattva]] named Prince Panchayudha (Five-Weapons) attempted to kill Silesaloma, but all his attacks, from both his weapons and his bare hands, were thwarted by Silesaloma's sticky hair. Ultimately, Prince Panchayudha impressed Silesaloma with his bravery, and the yaksha decided to let him go. Panchayudha explained that Silesaloma's monstrous state was caused by wicked deeds from his past lives, and he taught the yaksha the [[five precepts]], after which Silesaloma renounced violence and transformed into a friendly forest spirit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Mahamayuri|Mahāmāyūrīvidyārājñī]] Sūtra, a text that dates back to fourth century or earlier (translated from the [[Sanskrit]] by [[Kumarajiva]]), gives a large list of yakshas that reside in the classical cities of ancient India&lt;ref&gt;[V. S. Agravala, " Geographical Contents of Mahamayuri JUPHS, Vol. XV, Pt. ii, 1942, p. 28]&lt;/ref&gt; who are invoked to seek the protection of the BuddhaDharma:

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 6px #FFE0BB;padding:1.0em"&gt;

==Yakshas in Jainism==

[[Jainism|Jains]] mainly maintain [[cult image]]s of [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]]s and [[Tirthankara]]s, who have conquered the inner passions and attained moksha. ''Yakshas'' and ''yakshinis'' are found in pair around the cult images of Jinas, serving as guardian deities. The ''yaksha'' is generally on the right-hand side of the Jina image while the ''yakshini'' is on the left-hand side. They are regarded mainly as devotees of the Jina and have supernatural powers. They are also wandering through the cycles of births and deaths just like the worldly souls, but have supernatural powers.&lt;ref&gt;Pramodaben Chitrabhanu, ''Jain symbols, Ceremonies and Practices''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:'Digambara Yaksha Sarvahna' from Karnataka,  India, c. 900, Norton Simon Museum.JPG|thumbnail|'Digambara Yaksha Sarvahna', [[Norton Simon Museum]], {{circa|900&amp;nbsp;CE}}]]
The Harivamsapurana (783&amp;nbsp;CE) refers to them as Shasandevatas. Initially among the yakshas, Manibhadra and Purnabadra yakshas and Bahuputrika yakshini were popular. The yaksha [[Manibhadra]] is worshipped by the Jains affiliated with the Tapa Gachchha. During tenth and thirteenth centuries yaksha Saarvanubhuti, or Sarvahna and yakshinis [[Chakreshvari]], [[Ambika (Jainism)|Ambika]], [[Padmavati (Jainism)|Padmavati]], and [[Jwalamalini]] became so popular that independent temples devoted to them were erected.

Yakshas and yakshinis are common among the [[Murtipujaka]] [[Śvētāmbara]] and Bispanthi [[Digambara]] Jains. The [[Digambara Terapanth]] movement opposes their worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Flügel, Peter |year=2006 |title=Studies in Jaina History and Culture: Disputes and eialogues |publisher=Routledge |page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indian Antiquary |date=31 December 1903 |publisher=Popular Prakashan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzNCAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Gomedha+yaksha&amp;pg=PA496 |access-date=31 December 2019 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Murtipujaka Śvētāmbaras, the [[Tristutik Gaccha]] sect (both historical founded by Silagana and Devabhadra, and the modern sect organised by [[Rajendrasuri]]) object to the worship of shruta-devatas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jain |first=Shalin |year=2012 |title=Divided identities: The Jain sects in medieval India |journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress |volume=73 |pages=450–460 |jstor=44156237 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44156237 |via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yakshas in poems==
In [[Kālidāsa]]'s poem ''[[Meghadūta]]'', for instance, the {{IAST|yakṣa}} narrator is a romantic figure, pining with love for his missing beloved. By contrast, in the didactic Hindu dialogue of the [[Yaksha Prashna|{{IAST|Yakṣapraśnāḥ}}]] "Questions of the {{IAST|Yakṣa}}", it is a [[tutelary deity|tutelary spirit]] of a lake that challenges [[Yudhishthira|{{IAST|Yudhiṣṭhira}}]].

In ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' poem of Sri Lanka, a local population is given the term Yakkhas. [[Prince Vijaya]] encountered the royalty of the yakkhas' queen, [[Kuveni]], in her capital of [[Lanka]] pura and conquered them.

==Yakshas in Thailand==
[[File:Bangkok statue.jpg|thumb|Face of the yakṣa [[Narantaka-Devantaka|Thotsakhirithon]] (ทศคีรีธร) at [[Wat Phra Kaew]], [[Bangkok]]]]
Yakshas ({{lang-th|ยักษ์}}, {{RTGS|''Yak''}}) are an important element in [[Thai temple art and architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thaiworldview.com/wat/wat2.htm|title=Thai temples - page 2/7|website=www.thaiworldview.com|access-date=31 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are common as guardians of the gates in Buddhist temples throughout the country since at least the 14th century. [[Ceramic art|Ceramic sculptures]] of guardian yakshas were produced in [[Thailand]], during the [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] and [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya periods]], between the 14th and 16th centuries, at several [[kiln]] complexes in [[northern Thailand]]. They are mostly depicted with a characteristic face, having big round bulging eyes and protruding [[fang]]s, as well as a green complexion. Yakshas and their female counterparts are common in the Buddhist [[Thai literature|literature of Thailand]], such as in [[The Twelve Sisters]] and [[Phra Aphai Mani]]. As [[ogre]]s, giants, and ogresses, yakshas are present as well in [[Thai folklore]].

"{{lang|th|ย ยักษ์}}" ({{lang|th-Latn|yo yak}}) is also used as an illustration in order to name the letter ย, the 34th consonant of the [[Thai alphabet]], according to the traditional letter symbols Thai children use to memorise the alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thailandbuddy.com/learning-thai-language/Alphabet-Graffiti-Letters.html|title=Thai Alphabet in Letters|website=www.thailandbuddy.com|access-date=31 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ardhanarishvara''' ({{lang-sa|अर्धनारीश्वर|Ardhanārīśvara|the half-female Lord|translit-std=IAST}}), is a form of the Hindu deity [[Shiva]] combined with his consort [[Parvati]]. Ardhanarishvara is depicted as half-male and half-female, equally split down the middle. The right half is usually the male Shiva, illustrating his traditional attributes.

The earliest Ardhanarishvara images are dated to the [[Kushan]] period, starting from the first century [[Common era|CE]]. Its iconography evolved and was perfected in the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] era. The [[Puranas]] and various iconographic treatises write about the mythology and iconography of Ardhanarishvara. Ardhanarishvara remains a popular iconographic form found in most Shiva temples throughout India, though very few temples are dedicated to this deity.

Ardhanarishvara represents the synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe ([[Purusha]] and [[Prakriti]]) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, is inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God, and vice versa. The union of these principles is exalted as the root and womb of all creation. Another view is that Ardhanarishvara is a symbol of Shiva's all-pervasive nature.

==Names==
[[File:Man painted as Ardhanarishvara.jpg|thumb|Face painted as Ardhanarishvara]]
The name Ardhanarishvara means "the Lord Who is half woman."

[[Utpala (astronomer)|Utpala]], commenting on the [[Bṛhat Saṃhitā|Brihat Samhita]], calls this form  Ardha-Gaurishvara ("the Lord whose half is the fair one"; the fair one – Gauri – is an attribute of [[Parvati]]).&lt;ref&gt;Swami Parmeshwaranand p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vishnudharmottara Purana]] simply calls this form Gaurishvara ("The Lord/husband of Gauri).&lt;ref name = "collins80"/&gt;

==Origins and early images==
[[File:Kushana Ardhanareswar.jpg|thumb|upright|An early [[Kushan]] head of Ardhanarishvara, discovered at Rajghat, now in the [[Mathura Museum]]]]

The conception of Ardhanarishvara may have been inspired by [[Vedic]] literature's composite figure of [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]]-[[Yami]],{{sfn|Chakravarti|1986|p=44}}&lt;ref name = "swami58"&gt;Swami Parmeshwaranand p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; the Vedic descriptions of the primordial Creator Vishvarupa or [[Prajapati]] and the fire-god [[Agni]] as "bull who is also a cow,"&lt;ref name ="Kramrisch200"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Srinivasan57"/&gt; the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'s [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] ("Self") in the form of the androgynous cosmic man [[Purusha]]{{sfn|Chakravarti|1986|p=44}}&lt;ref name = "Srinivasan57"/&gt; and the androgynous myths of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Hermaphroditus]] and [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] [[Agdistis]].&lt;ref name ="Kramrisch200"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Daniélou63ff"/&gt; The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad says that Purusha splits himself into two parts, male and female, and the two halves copulate, producing all life – a theme concurrent in Ardhanarishvara's tales.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan pp. 57, 59&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] sows the seed of the [[Puranas|Puranic]] Ardhanarishvara. It declares [[Rudra]] – the antecedent of the Puranic Shiva – the maker of all and the root of Purusha (the male principle) and [[Prakriti]] (the female principle), adhering to [[Samkhya]] philosophy. It hints at his androgynous nature, describing him both as male and female.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan pp. 57–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Ardhanarishvara originated in [[Kushan]] and Greek cultures simultaneously; the iconography evolved in the Kushan era (30–375 CE), but was perfected in the Gupta era (320-600 CE).&lt;ref name = "swami55ff"&gt;Swami Parmeshwaranand pp. 55–6&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chakravarti|1986|p=146}} A mid-first century Kushan era [[Stele|stela]] in the [[Mathura Museum]] has a half-male, half-female image, along with three other figures identified with [[Vishnu]], [[Gaja Lakshmi]] and [[Kubera]].&lt;ref name = "swami58"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See image in Goldberg pp. 26–7&lt;/ref&gt; The male half is [[ithyphallic]] or with an ''urdhvalinga'' and makes an ''[[Abhayamudra|abhaya mudra]]'' gesture; the female left half holds a mirror and has a rounded breast. This is the earliest representation of Ardhanarishvara, universally recognized.&lt;ref name = "swami58"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Goldberg30"/&gt; An early Kushan Ardhanarishvara head discovered at Rajghat is displayed at the [[Mathura Museum]]. The right male half has matted hair with a skull and crescent moon; the left female half has well-combed hair decorated with flowers and wears a patra-kundala (earring). The face has a common [[third eye]]. A terracotta seal discovered in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]] has half-man, half-woman features.&lt;ref name = "swami58"/&gt; Early Kushan images show Ardhanarishvara in a simple two-armed form, but later texts and sculptures depict a more complex iconography.&lt;ref name = "Srinivasan57"/&gt;

Ardhanarishvara is referred to by the Greek author [[Stobaeus]] (c. 500 AD) while quoting [[Bardasanes]] (c. 154–222 AD), who learnt from an Indian embassy's visit to [[Syria]] during the reign of [[Elagabalus]] (Antoninus of Emesa) (218–22 AD).{{sfn|Chakravarti|1986|p=44}}&lt;ref name = "swami55ff"/&gt; A terracotta androgynous bust, excavated at [[Taxila]] and dated to the [[Saka]]-[[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] era, pictures a bearded man with female breasts.&lt;ref name = "swami55ff"/&gt;{{sfn|Chakravarti|1986|p=146}}

Ardhanarishvara is interpreted as an attempt to [[Syncretism|syncretise]] the two principal Hindu sects, [[Shaivism]] and [[Shaktism]], dedicated to Shiva and the [[Mahadevi|Great Goddess]]. A similar syncretic image is [[Harihara]], a composite form of Shiva and Vishnu, the Supreme deity of the [[Vaishnava]] sect.&lt;ref name = "garg"&gt;Garg (ed), pp. 598–9&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chakravarti|1986|p=43}}&lt;ref name = "Dehejia37ff"&gt;Dehejia pp. 37–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pande"&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704072150/http://www.alkapande.com/paper1.htm|archive-date=4 July 2008|url=http://www.alkapande.com/paper1.htm|title=The Icon of Creation – Ardhanarisvara|last=Pande|first=Dr. Alka|work=Official site of author|access-date=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Shakta Ardhanari.jpg|thumb|left|A rare example of a Shakta Ardhanarishvara, where the dominant right side is female]]
The iconographic 16th century work [[Shilparatna]], the [[Matsya Purana]] and [[Agama (Hinduism)|Agamic]] texts like Amshumadbhedagama, Kamikagama, Supredagama and Karanagama – most of them of South Indian origin – describe the iconography of Ardhanarishvara.&lt;ref&gt;Rao p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "matsya"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rajarajan|first=R. K.

In the case of three arms, the Parvati side has only one arm, suggesting a lesser role in the icon.

===Male half===

The male half wears a ''jata-mukuta'' (a headdress formed of piled, matted hair) on his head, adorned with a crescent moon. Sometimes the ''jata-mukuta'' is adorned with serpents and the river goddess [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganga]] flowing through the hair. The right ear wears a ''nakra-kundala'', ''sarpa-kundala'' ("serpent-earring") or ordinary kundala ("earring"). Sometimes, the male eye is depicted smaller than the female one and a half-moustache is also seen.&lt;ref name = "Rao324ff"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Goldberg4"/&gt; A half third eye (''trinetra'') is prescribed on the male side of the forehead in the canons; a full eye may also be depicted in middle of forehead separated by both the sides or a half eye may be shown above or below Parvati's round dot.&lt;ref name = "Rao324ff"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Goldberg5"/&gt; A common elliptical halo (''prabhamandala''/''prabhavali'') may be depicted behind the head; sometimes the shape of the halo may differ on either side.&lt;ref name = "Goldberg5"/&gt;

In the four-armed form, a right hand holds a ''[[parashu]]'' (axe) and another makes an ''abhaya mudra'' (gesture of reassurance), or one of the right arms is slightly bent and rests on the head of Shiva's bull mount, [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]], while the other is held in the ''abhaya mudra'' gesture. Another configuration suggests that a right hand holds a ''[[trishula]]'' (trident) and another makes a ''[[Varadamudra|varada mudra]]'' (gesture of blessing). Another scripture prescribes that a trishula and ''[[akshamala]]'' (rosary) are held in the two right hands. In the two-armed form, the right hand holds a [[kapala]] (skull cup) or gestures in a ''varada mudra''.&lt;ref name = "Rao324ff"&gt;Rao pp. 324–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Goldberg4"&gt;Goldberg p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He may also hold a skull.&lt;ref name = "matsya"/&gt; In the [[Badami]] relief, the four-armed Ardhanarishvara plays a [[veena]] (lute), using a left and a right arm, while other male arm holds a ''parashu'' and the female one a lotus.&lt;ref name = "Rao327ff"&gt;Rao pp. 327–8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ardhanari.png|thumb|upright|A three-armed bronze Ardhanarishvara]]
The Shiva half has a flat masculine chest, a straight vertical chest, broader shoulder, wider waist and muscular thigh.&lt;ref name = "Goldberg4"/&gt; He wears a [[Upanayana|''yagnopavita'']] (sacred thread) across the chest, which is sometimes represented as a ''naga-yagnopavita'' (a snake worn as a ''yagnopavita'') or a string of pearls or gems. The ''yajnopavita'' may also divide the torso into its male and female halves. He wears ornaments characteristic of Shiva's iconography, including serpent ornaments.&lt;ref name = "matsya"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rao324ff"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Goldberg5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

In some North Indian images,&lt;ref name = "Goldberg5"/&gt; the male half may be nude and also be ithyphallic (''urdhavlinga'' or ''urdhavreta'': with an erect phallus), however, connotes the very opposite in this context.{{sfn|Kramrisch|1994a|p=218}} It contextualize "seminal retention" or practice of [[Celibacy#Hinduism|celibacy]]&lt;ref name="govind52"&gt;Ghurye, G.S., 1952.

The right leg may be somewhat bent or straight and often rests on a lotus pedestal (''padma-pitha''). The whole right half is described as smeared with ashes and as terrible and red-coloured or gold or coral in appearance; however, these features are rarely depicted.&lt;ref name = "Rao324ff"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Goldberg5"/&gt;

===Female half===
The female half has ''karanda-mukuta'' (a basket-shaped crown) on her head or well-combed knotted hair or both. The left ear wears a ''valika-kundala'' (a type of earring). A ''[[tilaka]]'' or ''[[Bindi (decoration)|bindu]]'' (a round red dot) adorns her forehead, matching Shiva's third eye. The left eye is painted with black eyeliner.&lt;ref name="Rao325ff" /&gt; While the male neck is sometimes adorned with a jewelled hooded serpent, the female neck has a blue lotus matching it.&lt;ref name="swami57" /&gt;

In the four-armed form, one of the left arms rests on Nandi's head, while the other is bent in ''kataka mudra'' pose and holds a ''nilotpala'' (blue lotus) or hangs loosely at her side. In the three-armed representation, the left hand holds a flower, a mirror or a parrot. In the case of two-armed icons, the left hand rests on Nandi's head, hangs loose or holds either a flower, a mirror or a parrot. The parrot may be also perched on Parvati's wrist. Her hand(s) is/are adorned with ornaments like a ''keyura'' (anklet) or ''kankana'' (bangles).&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rao325ff"&gt;Rao pp. 325–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Parvati has a well-developed, round bosom and a narrow feminine waist embellished with various ''haras'' (religious bracelets) and other ornaments, made of diamonds and other gems. She has a fuller thigh and a curvier body and hip than the male part of the icon.&lt;ref name = "Goldberg30"&gt;Goldberg p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rao325ff"/&gt; The torso, hip and pelvis of the female is exaggerated to emphasize the anatomical differences between the halves.&lt;ref&gt;Rao pp. 329–30&lt;/ref&gt; Though the male private parts may be depicted, the female genitalia are never depicted and the loins are always draped.&lt;ref name = "Goldberg30"/&gt; She wears a multi-coloured or white silken garment down to her ankle and one or three girdles around her waist. The left half wears an anklet and her foot is painted red with [[henna]]. The left leg may be somewhat bent or straight, resting on a lotus pedestal. In contrast to the Shiva half, the Parvati half – smeared with saffron – is described as calm and gentle, fair and parrot-green or dark in colour.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rao325ff"/&gt; She may be draped in a [[sari]] covering her torso and legs.

===Postures and vahana===
[[File:God marriage AS.jpg|thumb|upright|A seated Ardhanarishvara with both the vahanas]]

The posture of Ardhanarishvara may be ''[[tribhanga]]'' – bent in three parts: head (leaning to the left), torso (to the right) and right leg or in the ''sthanamudra'' position (straight), sometimes standing on a lotus pedestal, whereupon it is called ''samapada''. Seated images of Ardhanarishvara are missing in iconographic treatises, but are still found in sculpture and painting.&lt;ref name = "Goldberg5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rao330ff"&gt;Rao pp. 330–2&lt;/ref&gt; Though the canons often depict the Nandi bull as the common ''[[vahana]]'' (mount) of Ardhanarishvara, some depictions have Shiva's bull ''vahana'' seated or standing near or behind his foot, while the goddess's lion ''vahana'' is near her foot.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan p.266&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniélou p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eight-armed form===

The [[Parsurameswar Temple|Parashurameshvara Temple]] at [[Bhubaneswar]] has a dancing eight-armed Ardhanarishvara. The upper male arms hold a lute and ''akshamala'' (rosary), while the upper female ones hold a mirror and a book; the others are broken.&lt;ref name ="swami57"&gt;Swami Parmeshwaranand p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Another non-conventional Ardhanarishvara is found at [[Darasuram]]. The sculpture is three-headed and eight-armed, holding ''akshamala'', ''khadga'' (sword), ''pasha'', ''musala'', ''kapala'' (skull cup), lotus and other objects.&lt;ref name="Rao330ff"/&gt;

===Other textual descriptions===

The [[Naradiya Purana]] mentions that Ardhanarishvara is half-black and half-yellow, nude on one side and clothed on other, wearing skulls and a garland of lotuses on the male half and female half respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Parmeshwaranand p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The Linga Purana gives a brief description of Ardhanarishvara as making ''varada'' and ''abhaya mudras'' and holding a ''trishula'' and a lotus.&lt;ref name ="linga"&gt;Collins p. 78-9&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vishnudharmottara Purana]] prescribes a four-armed form, with right hands holding a rosary and ''trishula'', while the left ones bear a mirror and a lotus. The form is called ''Gaurishvara'' in this text.&lt;ref name = "collins80"/&gt;

==Legends==
[[File:Ardhanari.jpg|thumb|upright|Ardhanarishvara relief is from the [[Elephanta Caves]] near [[Mumbai]]]]

The mythology of Ardhanarishvara – which mainly originates in the Puranic canons – was developed later to explain existent images of the deity that had emerged in the Kushan era.&lt;ref name = "Srinivasan57"&gt;Srinivasan p.57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Dehejia37ff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

The unnamed half-female form of Shiva is also alluded to in the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''. In Book XIII, Upamanyu praises Shiva rhetorically asking if there is anyone else whose half-body is shared by his spouse, and adds that the universe had risen from the union of sexes, as represented by Shiva's half-female form. In some narratives, Shiva is described as dark and fair-complexioned, half yellow and half white, half woman and half man, and both woman and man. In Book XIII, Shiva preaches to Parvati that half of his body is made up of her body.&lt;ref name = "Mbh"&gt;Collins p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'', Parvati requests Shiva to allow her to reside with him, embracing "limb-to-limb", and so Ardhanarishvara is formed.&lt;ref name="swami60ff"&gt;Swami Parmeshwaranand pp. 60–1&lt;/ref&gt; It also tells that when the demon [[Andhaka]] wanted to seize Parvati and make her his wife, Vishnu rescued her and brought her to his abode. When the demon followed her there, Parvati revealed her Ardhanarishvara form to him. Seeing the half-male, half-female form, the demon lost interest in her and left. Vishnu was amazed to see this form and saw himself in the female part of the form.&lt;ref name="Pande"/&gt;

The ''[[Shiva Purana]]'' describes that the creator god [[Brahma]] created all male beings, the [[Prajapati]]s, and told them to regenerate, which they were unable to do. Confronted with the resulting decline in the pace of creation, Brahma was perplexed and contemplated on Shiva for help. To enlighten Brahma of his folly, Shiva appeared before him as Ardhanarishvara. Brahma prayed to the female half of Shiva to give him a female to continue creation. The goddess agreed and created various female powers from her body, thereby allowing creation to progress.&lt;ref name ="Kramrisch200"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swami60ff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rao pp. 321–2&lt;/ref&gt; In other Puranas like the [[Linga Purana]], [[Vayu Purana]], [[Vishnu Purana]], [[Skanda Purana]],&lt;ref name ="Kramrisch200"/&gt; [[Kurma Purana]],&lt;ref&gt;Collins p.77-8&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Markandeya Purana]],&lt;ref&gt;Collins pp. 76–7&lt;/ref&gt; Rudra (identified with Shiva) appears as Ardhanarishvara, emerging from Brahma's head, forehead, mouth or soul as the embodiment of Brahma's fury and frustration due to the slow pace of creation. Brahma asks Rudra to divide himself, and the latter complies by dividing into male and female. Numerous beings, including the 11 [[Rudras]] and various female [[shakti]]s, are created from both the halves. In some versions, the goddess unites with Shiva again and promises to be born as [[Dakshayani|Sati]] on earth to be Shiva's wife.&lt;ref name ="Kramrisch200"&gt;Kramrisch pp. 200–3, 207–8&lt;/ref&gt; In the Linga Purana, the Ardhanarishvara Rudra is so hot that in the process of appearing from Brahma's forehead, he burns Brahma himself. Ardhanarishvara Shiva then enjoys his own half – the Great Goddess – by "the path of yoga" and creates Brahma and Vishnu from her body. In the repetitive cycle of [[Kalpa (aeon)|aeons]], Ardhanarishvara is ordained to reappear at the beginning of every creation as in the past.&lt;ref name ="linga"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kramrisch p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shiva Vinadhara.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ardhanarishvara playing a ''veena'' surrounded by [[Bhringi]] and a female attendant, [[Badami]]&lt;ref&gt;Rao pp. 327–8: The male half of the four-armed Ardhanarishvara at [[Badami]] wears snake ornaments and a knee-length deerskin dress and holds a ''parashu''. His ''jatamukuta'' is adorned by the crescent moon as well as a skull. The female side wears gold ornaments and an ankle-length silk garment, and carries a ''nilotpala''. Together with the remaining arms, Ardhanarishvara plays a ''veena''. The skeleton figure identified with Bhringi stands beside him. The bull stands behind the deity.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Matsya Purana describes how Brahma, pleased with a penance performed by Parvati, rewards her by blessing her with a golden complexion. This renders her more attractive to Shiva, to whom she later merges as one half of his body.&lt;ref name = "matsya"&gt;Collins p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tamil Nadu|Tamil]] temple lore narrates that once the gods and sages (''[[rishi]]'') had gathered at Shiva's abode, they prayed their respects to Shiva and Parvati. However, the sage [[Bhringi]] had vowed to worship only one deity, Shiva, and ignored Parvati while [[pradakshina|worshipping and circumambulating]] him. Agitated, Parvati cursed Bhringi to lose all his flesh and blood, reducing him to a skeleton. In this form Bhringi could not stand erect, so the compassionate ones who witnessed the scene blessed the sage with a third leg for support. As her attempt to humiliate the sage had failed, Parvati punished herself with austerities that pleased Shiva and led him to grant her the boon of uniting with him, thereby compelling Bhringi to worship her as well as himself in the form of Ardhanarishvara.  However, the sage assumed the form of a beetle and circumambulating only the male half, drilling a hole in the deity. Amazed by his devotion, Parvati reconciled with the sage and blessed him.&lt;ref&gt;Rao pp. 322–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pattanaik"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://devdutt.com/ardhanareshwara-the-hierarchy-of-halves/ |title=Ardhanareshwara |last=Pattanaik |first=Devdutt |date=Sep 16, 2005 |work=Official site of [[Devdutt Pattanaik]] |access-date=6 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121175321/http://devdutt.com/ardhanareshwara-the-hierarchy-of-halves/ |archive-date=21 November 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The seventh-century Shaiva [[Nayanars|Nayanar]] saint [[Appar]] mentions that after marrying Parvati, Shiva incorporated her into half of his body.&lt;ref name="Pande"/&gt;

In the [[Kalika Purana]], Parvati (called Gauri here) is described as having suspected Shiva of infidelity when she saw her own reflection in the crystal-like breast of Shiva. A conjugal dispute erupted but was quickly resolved, after which Parvati wished to stay eternally with Shiva in his body. The divine couple was thereafter fused as Ardhanarishvara.&lt;ref name="swami60ff"/&gt; Another tale from North India also talks about Parvati's jealousy. Another woman, the river Ganga – often depicted flowing out of Shiva's locks – sat on his head, while Parvati (as Gauri) sat on his lap. To pacify Gauri, Shiva united with her as Ardhanarishvara.&lt;ref name="Pattanaik"/&gt;

Only in tales associated with the cult of Shakta (in which the Goddess is considered the Supreme Being) is the Goddess venerated as the Maker of All. In these tales, it is her body (not Shiva's) which splits into male and female halves.&lt;ref name = "goldberg145"/&gt;

==Symbolism==
[[File:Khajuraho Ardharnareshvar.jpg|thumb|Ardhanarishvara sculpture, [[Khajuraho]]]]
Ardhanarishvara symbolizes that the male and female principles are inseparable.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/33339/Ardhanarisvara|title=Ardhanārīśvara|year=2011|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composite form conveys the [[unity of opposites]] (''coniunctio oppositorum'') in the universe.&lt;ref name = "garg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Daniélou63ff"&gt;Daniélou pp. 63–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kinsley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinsley|first=David |title=Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition|year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ|isbn=81-208-0394-9|pages=49–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg p.115&lt;/ref&gt; The male half of Ardhanarishvara stands for [[Purusha]] and female half is [[Prakriti]]. Purusha is the male principle and passive force of the universe, while Prakriti is the female active force; both are "constantly drawn to embrace and fuse with each other, though... separated by the intervening axis". The union of Purusha (Shiva) and Prikriti (Shiva's energy, Shakti) generates the universe, an idea also manifested in the union of the [[Linga]] of Shiva and [[Yoni]] of Devi creating the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Rao pp. 332&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swami59"&gt;Swami Parmeshwaranand p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniélou"&gt;{{cite book|last=Daniélou|first=Alain|title=The Myths and Gods of India: the Classic Work on Hindu Polytheism|year=1985|publisher=Inner Traditions|isbn=0-89281-354-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mythsgodsofindia00dani}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahabharata lauds this form as the source of creation.&lt;ref name = "Mbh"/&gt; Ardhanarishvara also suggests the element of [[Kama]] or Lust, which leads to creation.&lt;ref name="Daniélou"/&gt;

Ardhanarishvara signifies "totality that lies beyond duality", "bi-unity of male and female in God" and "the bisexuality and therefore the non-duality" of the Supreme Being.&lt;ref name = "Dehejia37ff"/&gt;&lt;ref name=conner67&gt;{{cite book |title= Cassell's Encyclopedia of Queer Myth, Symbol and Spirit|last= Conner |first= Randy P. |author2=Sparks, David Hatfield |author3=Sparks, Mariya |year=1998 |publisher=Cassell |location=UK |isbn=0-304-70423-7|page = 67|chapter = Ardhararishvara}}&lt;/ref&gt; It conveys that God is both Shiva and Parvati, "both male and female, both father and mother, both aloof and active, both fearsome and gentle, both destructive and constructive" and unifies all other dichotomies of the universe.&lt;ref name="kinsley"/&gt; While Shiva's rosary in the Ardhanarishvara iconography associates him with asceticism and spirituality, Parvati's mirror associates her to the material illusory world.&lt;ref name = "Srinivasan158"/&gt; Ardhanarishvara reconciles and harmonizes the two conflicting ways of life: the spiritual way of the ascetic as represented by Shiva, and the materialistic way of the householder as symbolized by Parvati, who invites the ascetic Shiva into marriage and the wider circle of worldly affairs. The interdependence of Shiva on his power (''Shakti'') as embodied in Parvati is also manifested in this form.&lt;ref name="kinsley"/&gt; Ardhanarishvara conveys that Shiva and Shakti are one and the same, an interpretation also declared in inscriptions found along with Ardhanarishvara images in [[Java]] and the eastern [[Malay Archipelago]].&lt;ref name = "garg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swami58"/&gt; The Vishnudharmottara Purana also emphasizes the identity and sameness of the male Purusha and female Prakriti, manifested in the image of Ardhanarishvara.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shaiva guru [[Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]] (1927–2001), Ardhanarishvara signifies that the great Shiva is "All, inseparable from His energy" (i.e. his ''Shakti'') and is beyond gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sivaya Subramuniyaswami|author-link=Sivaya Subramuniyaswami|title=Dancing with Siva: Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism|year=2003|publisher=Himalayan Academy Publications|page=758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ardhanari Gangakonda.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|A three-armed Ardhanarishvara sculpture with only Nandi as a ''vahana'', 11th century, [[Gangaikonda Cholapuram]] temple]]
Across cultures, hermaphrodite figures like Ardhanarishvara have traditionally been associated with fertility and abundant growth. In this form, Shiva in his eternal embrace with Prakriti represents the eternal reproductive power of Nature, whom he regenerates after she loses her fertility. "It is a duality in unity, the underlying principle being a sexual dualism".&lt;ref name="swami59"/&gt; Art historian [[C. Sivarama Murti|Sivaramamurti]] calls it "a unique connection of the closely knit ideal of man and woman rising above the craving of the flesh and serving as a symbol of hospitality and parenthood".&lt;ref name = "Dehejia37ff"/&gt; The dual unity of Ardhanarishvara is  considered "a model of conjugal inseparability". Padma Upadhyaya comments, "The idea of ... Ardhanārīśvara is to locate the man in the woman as also the woman in the man and to create perfect homogeneity in domestic affairs".{{sfn|Chakravarti|1986|p=43}}

Often, the right half of Ardhanarishvara is male and the left is female. The left side is the location of the heart and is associated with 'feminine' characteristics like intuition and creativity, while the right is associated with the brain and 'masculine' traits – logic, valour and systematic thought.&lt;ref name = "Daniélou63ff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; The female is often not equal in the Ardhanarishvara, the male god who is half female; she remains a dependent entity.&lt;ref name="Courtright"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Courtright|first=Paul B.|date=December 2005|title=Review: The Lord Who is Half Woman: Ardhanāriśvara in Indian and Feminist Perspective.|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|volume=73|issue=4|pages=1215–1217|doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfi130|url=http://jaar.oxfordjournals.org/content/73/4/1215.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ardhanarishvara "is in essence Shiva, not Parvati". This is also reflected in mythology, where Parvati becomes a part of Shiva. It is likewise reflected in iconography: Shiva often has two supernatural arms and Parvati has just one earthly arm, and his bull ''vahana'' – not her lion vahana – typically accompanies them.&lt;ref name="Seid"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seid|first=Betty|year=2004|title=The Lord Who Is Half Woman (Ardhanarishvara)|journal=Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago|volume=30|issue=1|pages=48–95|jstor=4129920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==
[[File:Ardinary.jpg|thumb|right|Ardhanarishvara worshipped at [[Sri Rajarajeswari Peetam]]]]

Ardhanarishvara is one of the most popular iconographic forms of Shiva.

'''''Devata''''' (pl: ''devatas'', meaning 'the gods') ([[Devanagari]]: देवता; [[Khmer language|Khmer]]: ទេវតា (''tevoda''); [[Thai language|Thai]]: เทวดา (''tevada''); [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Balinese language|Balinese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''dewata''; [[Batak languages]]: ''debata'' [[Toba Batak language|(Toba)]], ''dibata'' [[Batak Karo language|(Karo)]], ''naibata'' [[Batak Simalungun language|(Simalungun)]]; ''[[Anito|diwata]]'' ([[Philippine languages]])) are smaller and more focused Devas (Deities) in [[Indian religions]], such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The term "devata" itself can also mean deva. They can be either male or female. Every human activity has its devata, its spiritual counterpart or aspect.

==Types==
[[File:Apsara Relief Sculpture on Angkor Wat Temple Wall Feb 10 2000.jpg|alt=Devata Sculpture on Wall at Angkor Wat temple, Cambodia|thumb|Devata Sculpture on Wall at Angkor Wat temple, Cambodia]]
There are many kinds of devatas: vanadevatas (forest spirits, perhaps descendants of early nature-spirit cults), [[gramadevata]] (village gods), devatas of river crossings, caves, mountains, and so on. For example, in the [[Konkan]] region of [[India]], Hindu devatas are often divided into five categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Folklore Notes, Vol. 2, Konkan|year=1915|publisher=British India Press, Mazgaon.|location=Bombay|author=R.E. Enthoven|author2=A. M. T. Jackson|author2-link=A. M. T. Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Gramadevata|Grama devatas]] or village deities who could be the founder deity such as [[Punjabi folk religion#Jathera—ancestral shrines|Jathera]] or [[Balinese Hinduism#Rituals|ancestral worship of Bali]], and examples include [[Santoshi]], [[Renuka]], [[Aiyanar]]
# Sthana devatas or local deities, for example, those in certain places of pilgrimage like [[Rama]] in [[Nasik]], [[Vithoba]] in Pandharpur, [[Krishna]] at Dwarka, [[Kali]] at Kolkata, [[Lakshmi|Mahalakshmi]] at Kolhapur, [[Devi Kanya Kumari]] at [[Kanyakumari]]
# [[Kuladevata|Kula devatas]] or family deities, like Khanderai and [[Muniandi]]
# [[Iṣṭa-devatā (Hinduism)|Ishta devatas]] or chosen deities
# Vastu devatas or Gruha devatas, a class of deities that preside over the house.
Following are some of the important types of Devatas in [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan Buddhism]]:

* '''Bandara Devathavo''' are devatas of trees, mountains, etc.
* '''Gambara Devathavo''' are devatas of the villages
* '''Graha Devathavo''' are devatas of planets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Who are Gods &amp; Goddesses|url=https://nofearmanju.weebly.com/who-are-gods--goddesses.html|access-date=2021-03-18|website=Why Do I Meditate?|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sri Lanka Web Portal on Astrology and Spiritual Development|url=https://lankawisdom.com/|access-date=2021-03-18|website=lankawisdom.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scriptures==
Some well-known Hindu-Buddhist heavenly beings belong to the group of devatas, such as [[apsara]]s or [[Vidyadhara|vidhyadaris]] (female cloud and water spirits) and their male counterparts, the [[gandharva]]s (heavenly musicians). Devatas often occur in many [[Jataka tales|Buddhist Jatakas]], Hindu epics such as the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]] and in many other Buddhist holy scriptures.
The island of [[Bali]] is nicknamed ''Pulau Dewata'' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: "islands of devata or island of gods") because of its vivid [[Hindu culture]] and traditions. In Indonesia, the term [[hyang]] is equivalent to devata. In Hinduism, the devatas that guard the eight, nine and ten cardinal points are called [[Lokapala]] ([[Guardians of the directions|Guardians of the Directions]]) or, more specifically in ancient [[Java]] tradition, ''Dewata Nawa Sanga'' ([[Surya Majapahit|Guardians of Nine Directions]]).

{{short description|Rivers featured in Hinduism}}
In [[Hinduism]], rivers are often personified as deities. In the [[Rigveda]], there are mentions of holy rivers such as the [[Saraswati river|Sarasvati]]. The river [[Ganges]] is considered to be most sacred, and is personified as the goddess [[Ganga (goddess)|Ganga]]. Most of the rivers are represented in female form,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mahavidya.ca/2015/06/26/river-goddesses/|title=River Goddesses &amp;#124; Mahavidya}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the notable exception of [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]], which is considered to be male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://riverfoundation.org.au/2017/03/womens-voices-brahmaputra-river/|title=Being bold for change: Women's voices from the Brahmaputra River|date=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, it is believed that the people of the [[Indus Valley civilization|Indus Valley]] civilisation worshipped the rivers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2022}} The most significant rivers in the faith are the ''Saptanadi'': the [[Ganges]], [[Yamuna]], [[Indus River|Sindhu]], [[Narmada River|Narmada]], [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]], and [[Kaveri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Eck |first=Diana L. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNlJOSf__xYC&amp;dq=saptanadi&amp;pg=PA166 |title=India: A Sacred Geography |date=2012-03-27 |publisher=Harmony/Rodale |isbn=978-0-385-53191-7 |pages=166 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ganga===
{{Main|Ganga in Hinduism}}&lt;!--{{Copying within Wikipedia|Ganga (goddess)}}--&gt;
The [[Vedas]] and [[Puranas]] mention the river [[Ganges]] to be the most sacred river. In some legends, the goddess Ganga is daughter of [[Himavat|Himavan]] (the personification of the [[Himalayas]]) and Menavati (an ''[[apasara|apsara]]''). She is the sister of the mother goddess, [[Parvati]]. She is the goddess of purity and purification, as people believe bathing in the Ganges removes sins and helps in gaining ''[[moksha]]''. Her mount is a creature called the [[makara]].

A legend in the [[Bhagavata Purana]] and [[Devi-Bhagavata Purana|Devi Bhagavata Purana]] describes Ganga as originally being one of the three wives of Vishnu, along with [[Lakshmi]] and [[Saraswati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dalal |first=Roshen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrk0AwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Ganga+shiva |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |date=2014-04-18 |publisher=Penguin UK |isbn=978-81-8475-277-9 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the midst of a conversation, Saraswati observed that Ganga playfully kept glancing at Vishnu, behind Lakshmi and her back. Frustrated, Saraswati launched a furious tirade against Ganga, accusing her of stealing Vishnu's love away from her. When Ganga appealed to her husband to help her, he opted to remain neutral, not wishing to participate in a quarrel between his three wives, whom he loved equally. When Lakshmi attempted to soothe Saraswati's anger by reasoning with her, the jealous goddess grew angry with her as well, accusing her of disloyalty towards her. She cursed Lakshmi to be born as the [[Tulasi in Hinduism|tulasi]] plant upon the earth. Ganga, now enraged that Lakshmi had been cursed because she had defended her, cursed Saraswati that she would be incarnated as a river on earth. Saraswati issued the same curse against Ganga, informing her that sinful men would cleanse themselves of their sins with her water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2013-05-15 |title=On the coming in this world of Lakṣmī, Gaṅgā and Sarasvatī [Chapter 6] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/devi-bhagavata-purana/d/doc57319.html |access-date=2022-10-21 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Williams |first=George M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7LOZfwCDpEC&amp;dq=three+wives+vishnu&amp;pg=PA137 |title=Handbook of Hindu Mythology |date=2008-03-27 |publisher=OUP USA |isbn=978-0-19-533261-2 |pages=137 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sharma |first=Bulbul |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=on_ZhlB5taUC&amp;dq=bhagavata+purana+lakshmi+ganga+saraswati&amp;pg=PA67 |title=The Book of Devi |date=June 2010 |publisher=Penguin Books India |isbn=978-0-14-306766-5 |pages=67–71 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent legend of Ganga is her descent from [[Svarga]], the heaven of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]]. [[Bhagiratha]], a king of the [[Solar dynasty]], is stated to have performed a penance to propitiate Ganga, and urged her to descend upon earth from Svarga to liberate his ancestors' spirits, who had perished in [[Patala]], the netherworld. She informed him that her descent would be powerful enough to flood the earth were she to directly land upon its ground, and hence told him to request [[Shiva]] to help. Bhagiratha performed another penance to propitiate the destroyer deity, and Shiva agreed to lend his assistance. When Ganga descended upon the earth, Shiva captured her waters in his matted hair, and released her gently upon the earth. Heeding Bhagiratha's request, she flowed to Patala to ritually cleanse his ancestors' spirits, and then flowed into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Seshadri|first=Lakshmi|title=Ganga|year=1975 |publisher=Amar Chitra Katha private limited|isbn=81-89999-36-2|editor-last=Pai|editor-first=Anant}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Teracoota made Yamuna, Gupta artefacts 02.jpg|thumb|5th century terracotta sculpture of Yamuna with attendants]]

===Yamuna===
{{Main|Yamuna in Hinduism}}
Yamuna, or Yami, is the personification of the [[Yamuna]] river. She is described to be daughter of [[Surya]], the sun god, and [[Saranyu]], the cloud goddess. She is the goddess of life, and the twin of [[Yama]], the god of the underworld. Her siblings include [[Tapati]], another river goddess. In later texts, she is known as Kalindi. In the [[Bhagavata Purana]], in a legend that is associated with canal irrigation, the deity [[Balarama]] once wished to sport with some women in the Yamuna river. When he beckoned the goddess Yamuna to come to him, she refused to shift from her banks. Hence, Balarama used his plough, and forcibly dragged the river goddess to the orchard where he stood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pattanaik |first=Devdutt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVsoDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=krishna+river+goddess&amp;pg=PT92 |title=The Goddess in India: The Five Faces of the Eternal Feminine |date=2000-09-01 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-59477-537-6 |pages=92 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saraswati===
{{Main|Saraswati}}
&lt;!--{{Copying within Wikipedia|Saraswati}}--&gt;
The goddess Saraswati was originally represented as a river goddess, the goddess of the eponymous [[Saraswati|Sarasvati]] river. She later developed into one of the principal goddesses in [[Hinduism]], regarded to be the goddess of knowledge, music, speech, and art. The Sarasvati river is mentioned in the Rigveda, and is believed to have dried up through the course of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2019-07-19|title=Bringing back the ancient Saraswati river|url=https://india.mongabay.com/2019/07/upcoming-elections-in-haryana-boost-efforts-to-revive-the-ancient-saraswati-river/|access-date=2021-02-19|website=Mongabay-India|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some texts, it is written that once there was a terrible battle between the [[Bhargava|Bhargavas]] and [[Heheya Kingdom|Hehayas]], and from this an all-consuming fire called [[Vadavagni]] was born, which had the potential to destroy the whole world. [[Indra]], Vishnu, and the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] visited Saraswati, requesting her to deposit the fire in the western ocean, in order to protect the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=General |first=India Office of the Registrar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zQEdAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Vadavagni+Saraswati |title=Census of India, 1961: Gujarat |date=1965 |publisher=Manager of Publications |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Danino |first=Michel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8yc7-OirxKEC&amp;q=vadavagni+and+Saraswati |title=The Lost River: On the Trail of the Sarasvatī |date=2010 |publisher=Penguin Books India |isbn=978-0-14-306864-8 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saraswati told Vishnu that she would only agree to assist them if her consort, [[Brahma]], told her to do so. Brahma ordered her to deposit the Vadavagni in the western ocean. Saraswati agreed, and accompanied by [[Ganga (goddess)|Ganga]], she left Brahmaloka, and arrived at Sage [[Uttanka|Uttanka's]] [[Ashram|ashrama]]. There, she met [[Shiva]], who had decided to carry Ganga. He gave the Vadavagni in a pot to Saraswati, and told her to originate from the [[Ficus religiosa|plaksha]] tree. Saraswati merged with the tree, and transformed into a river. From there, she flowed towards [[Pushkar|Pushkara]]. Saraswati continued her journey towards the ocean, and stopped once at Pushkarini, where she redeemed humans from their sins. At last, she reached the end of her journey, and immersed the fire into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2019-01-28 |title=Story of Sarasvatī |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/compilation/puranic-encyclopaedia/d/doc241934.html |access-date=2022-10-21 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=N.

===Narmada===
{{Main|Narmada#Significance in Hinduism|}}
The goddess [[Yamuna in Hinduism|Narmada]] is the personification of the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] river. She is also known as Reva. According to popular tradition, she is said to have been born from the sweat of Shiva, who had been performing a penance on Mount Riksha. Hence, she is regarded to be the deity's daughter. According to one legend, she is said to have been blessed by Shiva to possess the ability to destroy the sins of all those who bathe in her waters, and become as sacred in the south as Ganga was in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Eck |first=Diana L. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNlJOSf__xYC&amp;dq=narmada+shiva+daughter&amp;pg=PA170 |title=India: A Sacred Geography |date=2012-03-27 |publisher=Harmony/Rodale |isbn=978-0-385-53191-7 |pages=172 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kaveri ===
[[File:Kaveri river goddess Madikeri.jpg|thumb|Statue of the goddess Kaveri, Madikeri.]]
The goddess Kaveri, also known locally as Kaveriamma, is the personification of the river [[Kaveri]]. According to the [[Skanda Purana]], during the episode of the [[Samudra Manthana]], [[Vishnu]] assumed his ravishing female form of [[Mohini]] to offer the [[Amrita|elixir of eternal life]] to the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]], and deny it to the [[Asura|asuras]]. His consort, [[Lakshmi]], sent an [[apsara]] named Lopamudra to assist Mohini in this endeavour. Lopamudra was raised by [[Brahma]] as his adopted daughter after this event. When King Kavera propitiated Brahma for a child, the deity blessed him with Lopamudra, with the patronymic Kaveri, as his daughter, so that she would rid people of their sins and usher in fertility. When the sage [[Agastya]] wished Kaveri to marry him, she agreed, but on the condition that she would leave him if he were to ever leave her alone for too long. Agastya agreed, but one day, too occupied with his disciples, he did leave her on her lonesome for a substantial period of time. Kaveri flowed into the sage's [[Kamandalu|kamandalam]], and soon coursed southwards. Despite the attempts of her husband's disciples to stop her, she flowed into the ocean, and is regarded to be sacred ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Krishna |first=Nanditha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gp1IDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=agastya+kaveri&amp;pg=PT82 |title=Hinduism and Nature |date=2017-12-26 |publisher=Penguin Random House India Private Limited |isbn=978-93-87326-54-5 |pages=82–83 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To expiate the sin of having caused the death of a sacred creature, Gautama propitiated the goddess Ganga to descend upon his hermitage and cleanse it. She acquiesced, descending upon the land as the goddess Godavari, along with Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Krishna |first=Nanditha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gp1IDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=goddess+godavari+gautama&amp;pg=PT77 |title=Hinduism and Nature |date=2017-12-26 |publisher=Penguin Random House India Private Limited |isbn=978-93-87326-54-5 |pages=77 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savitri rushed to the spot when she heard the chanting of mantras, and demanded to know why Gayatri had taken her place. She directed her fury at Vishnu and Shiva, transforming the former into the Krishna river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Balasubramanian |first=Lalitha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gz0zDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=krishna+river+brahma+gayatri&amp;pg=PT146 |title=Temples in Maharashtra: A Travel Guide |date=2017-08-30 |publisher=Notion Press |isbn=978-1-947697-88-1 |pages=146 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Aditya (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Surya with Adityas.jpg|thumb|An 11th–century sculpture of [[Surya]] with eleven other Adityas depicted at the top]]

In [[Hinduism]], '''Adityas''' ({{lang-sa|आदित्य|Āditya|of Aditi}}, {{IPA-sa|aːd̪ɪt̪jɐ|pronunciation}}), refers to the offspring of [[Aditi]], the goddess representing the infinity.&lt;ref name=Karel-2005/&gt; The name ''Aditya'', in the singular, is taken to refer to the [[solar deity|sun god]] [[Surya]]. Generally, Adityas are twelve in number and consists of Vivasvan, [[Aryaman]], [[Tvashta]], [[Savitr]], [[Bhaga]], [[Dhatri|Dhata]], [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]], [[Varuna]], [[Ansa (god)|Amsa]], [[Pushan]], [[Indra]] and [[Vishnu]] (in the form of [[Vamana]]).&lt;ref name=Dalal-2014/&gt;

They appear in the ''[[Rig Veda]]'', where there are 6–8 in number, all male. The number increases to 12 in the ''[[Brahmanas]]''. The [[Mahabharata]] and the ''[[Puranas]]'' mention the sage [[Kashyapa]]  as their father.&lt;ref name=Dalal-2014/&gt; In each month of the year a different Aditya is said to shine.

==Sun worship ==

===Characterisation===
{{see also | Solar deity }}

The Aditya have been described in the [[Rig Veda]] as bright and pure as streams of water, free from all guile and falsehood, blameless, perfect.

This class of deities has been seen as upholding the movables and immovable [[Dharma]].
Adityas are beneficent gods who act as protectors of all beings, who are provident and guard the world of spirits and protect the world. In the form of [[Mitra-Varuna]], the Adityas are true to the eternal Law and act as the exactors of debt.&lt;ref name=RigVeda-2-XXVII/&gt;

In present-day usage in [[Sanskrit]], the term Aditya has been made singular in contrast to Vedic ''Adityas'', and are being used synonymously with [[Surya]], the Sun. The twelve Adityas are believed to represent the twelve months in the calendar and the twelve aspects of Sun. Since they are twelve in number, they are referred as DvadashAdityas.&lt;ref name=Sathyam-Anc-Sages/&gt;

The 12&amp;nbsp;Ādityás are basically the monthly suns, corresponding to the approximately 12&amp;nbsp;lunations in a solar year.{{efn|The actual value is close to {{sfrac|12|7|19}}; {{nowrap| &amp;nbsp; {{sfrac|7|19}} ≈ {{frac|1|3}} ; }} so there always 12&amp;nbsp;complete lunar months in a solar year, and about every third year there is an extra, 13&amp;nbsp;th lunar month, which the assignment of deities to months does not appear to address.}} These are also called the 12&amp;nbsp;purushas, pertaining to the 12&amp;nbsp;lunar months of the year. Here the months refer to the lunar months. In astronomy the lunar months with a solar sankranti are said to have an Aditya or purusha. The month without a sankranti is said to be neuter and is said to be an extra month or the intercalary lunar month.

===Mentions in Hindu scriptures===
{{anchor | scripture | Scriptures | Text | Texts }} 
{{see also | Hindu texts}} 

The Ādityas are one of the principal deities of the [[Vedic]] classical [[Hinduism]] belonging to the solar class. In the Vedas, numerous hymns are dedicated to [[Mitra]], [[Varuna]], [[Savitr]], etc.

In hymn 7.99 of the ''[[Rigveda]]'', [[Indra]]-[[Vishnu]] produces the sun, his discus a vestige of his solar creation, equivalent to the sun. The Vishnu [[purana]] identifies the Discus chakra with the following: 'thoughts, like the chakra, flow faster than even the mightiest wind.'

The [[Gayatri mantra]], which is regarded as one of the most sacred of the Vedic hymns is dedicated to Savitr, one of the principal Ādityas. The Adityas are a group of solar deities, from the [[Brahmana]] period numbering twelve. The ritual of ''[[Surya Namaskār|Surya Namaskaar]]'', performed by [[Hindus]], is an elaborate set of hand gestures and body movements, designed to greet and revere the Sun.

The sun god in Hinduism is an ancient and revered deity. In later Hindu usage, all the Vedic Ādityas lost identity and metamorphosed into one composite deity, [[Surya]], the Sun. The attributes of all other Ādityas merged into that of Surya and the names of all other [[Ādityas]] became synonymous with, or epithets of, Surya.

The ''[[Ramayana]]'' has [[Rama]] as a direct descendant of the Surya, thus belonging to the [[Suryavansha|Suryavamsha]] or the Solar dynasty. The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' describes one of its warrior heroes, [[Karna]], as being the son of the Pandava mother [[Kunti]] and Surya.

The sun god is said to be married to the goddess [[Sanjna|Sanjnya]]. She is depicted in dual form, being both sunlight and shadow, personified. The goddess is revered in Gujarat and Rajasthan.

The charioteer of Surya is [[Aruṇa|Aruna]], who is also personified as the redness that accompanies the sunlight in dawn and dusk. The sun god is driven by a seven-horsed Chariot depicting the seven days of the week and the seven colours of rainbow which are seen due to the dispersion by [[Surya]]'s rays.

=== Surya Namaskaram ===
{{main|Sun Salutation}}
[[Surya Namaskar|Surya Namaskaram]], the ''Salute to the Sun'' or ''Sun Salutation'', is worship of sun&lt;ref name="Sun Salutation"&gt;{{cite book |last=Singh |first=Kritika |title=Sun Salutation: Full step by step explanation |url=https://www.suryanamaskar.org/ |publisher=Surya Namaskar Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is also included as a practice in [[yoga as exercise]] incorporating a flow sequence of some twelve gracefully linked [[asana]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Carol |title=Yoga on the Ball |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8Xgqsbp_6oC |year=2003 |publisher=Inner Traditions |isbn=978-0-89281-999-7 |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=macmullen68&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacMullen |first=Jane |title=Ashtanga Yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cfUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA68 |volume=September/October |year=1988 |journal=[[Yoga Journal]] |pages=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar exercises were in use in India, for example [[Indian wrestling|among wrestlers]]. The basic sequence involves moving from a standing position into [[Downward dog|Downward]] and [[Upward Dog]] poses and then back to the standing position, but many variations are possible. The set of 12 asanas is dedicated to the solar deity [[Surya]]. In some Indian traditions, the positions are each associated with a different [[mantra]].

=== Sun worship festivals ===
{{anchor | Festivals | Festival }}
{{see also | List of Hindu festivals }}

[[Makar Sankranti]] is a festival dedicated to sun worship in India and by the [[hindu diaspora]] of India.

[[Chhath]] (Hindi: छठ, also called ''Dala Chhath'') is an ancient Hindu festival dedicated to Surya, the chief solar deity, unique to [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]] and the [[Terai]]. This major festival is also celebrated in the northeast region of [[India]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], and parts of [[Chhattisgarh]]. Hymns to the Sun can be found in the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism. Practiced in different parts of India, the worship of the Sun has been described in the Rigveda. There is another festival called Sambha-Dasami, which is celebrated in the state of Odisha for the ''surya''.

=== Aditya as nakshatra devatas ===
{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2020}}

Adityas are responsible for proper functioning of the universe and in Hindu cosmology they are given lordship over celestial constellations, called ''[[nakshatra]]s'' in [[Jyotish vidya|Jyotish]]. Nakshatras are forces of universal intelligence which are intertwined with the birth-death cycle of life, identity of all created beings, events and day to day consciousness in our lives.  In India, at [[Konark]], in the state of [[Odisha]], a temple is dedicated to Surya. The [[Konark Sun Temple]] has been declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Surya is the most prominent of the ''[[navagrahas]]'' or nine celestial objects of the Hindus. ''Navagrahas'' can be found in almost all Hindu temples. 

Adityas manage the Shakti of the nakshatras. Here are few examples.

# Bhaga has lordship over [[Pūrva Phalgunī|Purva Phalguni]] nakshatra. Bhaga is bestower of fortune. Bhaga in Sanskrit means "a portion" so our portion in life is regulated by this divine celestial being. Many a times this is related to fortunate marriages, or fortune from marriage and partnerships. It is a very worldly nakshatra bestowing divine intelligence with respect to worldly gains in life. Beings born when Purva Phalguni is rising in the east are literal physical manifestation of this energy.
# [[Aryaman|Aryama]], the God of Patronage, is an Aditya who is the lord of [[Uttara Phalgunī|Uttar Phalguni]] nakshatra and as suggested by the name, a person born under the auspices of Aryama finds many lucky opportunities with benefactors in their lives, among many other qualities that are possessed by this divine being.
# [[Savitr|Savitur]], rules over [[Hasta (nakshatra)|Hasta]] Nakshatra and is the cheerful Aditya who manages worldly skills and artistry. Handiwork of all kinds, from needlework, pottery making to technical skills industry, sleight of hand pick pockets, magicians, and Reiki masters all are blessed by the divine intelligence and benevolence of this Aditya.
# [[Mitra]], rules over [[Anuradha (nakshatra)|Anuradha]] nakshatra they are the peacekeepers of this world.
# [[Varuna]], rules over [[Shatabhisha|Shatbhishak]] nakshatra the nakshatra of 1000&amp;nbsp;healers and gives a person intelligence about all sorts of medicine. Varuna as its ruling Aditya is lord keeper of law, hence themes of crime and punishment, law and order fall under his rulership. Varuna in RigVeda is to be feared and not taken lightly.

This makes Vedic Adityas not some conceptual, abstract, or mythological characters in a story book, but part of the visible cosmology and the everyday realities of our daily lives. We manifest their qualities in our lives and as such are part of the divine ourselves.

[[Radha]] [[Krishna]]'s first literary mention was found in King [[Hāla|Hala]]'s [[Prakrit]] text ''[[Gaha Sattasai|Gatha Saptasati]]'' which is composed of 700 verses and was written in the 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jash|first=Pranabananda|title=Radha-Madhava Sub-Sect in Eastern India|date=1979|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44141958|journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress|volume=40|pages=177–184|jstor=44141958|issn=2249-1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Gokhale|first1=Namita|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWJ7DwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Radha+in+Padma+Purana&amp;pg=PT7|title=Finding Radha: The Quest for Love|last2=Lal|first2=Malashri|date=2018-12-10|publisher=Penguin Random House India Private Limited|isbn=978-93-5305-361-1|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ramnarace|2014|p=}} Later, The popular ''[[Gita Govinda]]'' written by [[Jayadeva]] in 12th century CE widely depicted Radha and Krishna as a couple.{{sfn|Love Song of the Dark Lord: Jayadeva's Gītagovinda|1977}}{{sfn|Archer|2004|loc=5.2 The Gita Govinda}}{{sfn|Datta|1988|pp=1414–1423}} According to scriptures like ''[[Brahma Vaivarta Purana]]'' and ''Garga Samhita'', Radha-Krishna are the supreme deities. Content of both the scriptures are majorly based on the divine pastimes of Radha Krishna in [[Vrindavan]] and [[Goloka]]. The other relevant texts mentioning Radha Krishna are Radhopnishad of [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]], Radhatapani Upanishad of [[Atharvaveda|Atharva Veda]], [[Shiva Purana|Shiva Puran]] , [[Brahmanda Purana|Brahmanda Puran]], [[Skanda Purana|Skanda Puran]], [[Padma Purana|Padma Puran]], [[Matsya Purana|Matsya Puran]], [[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]], [[Pancharatra|Narada Pancharatra]] and [[Brahma Samhita|Brahma samhita]]. Goddess Radha is also indirectly mentioned in [[Bhagavata Purana]] of [[Shuka|Sukadeva Goswami]] along with Lord Krishna under many different names like "Aradhika" and "Gopi".{{sfn|Archer|2004|loc=5.1 The Triumph of Radha}} [[Adi Shankara|Adi Shankracharya]] who happened way before Jayadeva also mentioned Goddess Radha in his work called "Achyuta Ashtakam" which is dedicated to [[Achyuta]] form of Lord Krishna.

The devotional works of Jayadeva, [[Nimbarkacharya]], Rasik saints like [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] along with his six disciple goswamis, Bhakti poet-saints [[Narsinh Mehta]], [[Vidyapati]], [[Chandidas]], [[Meera Bai]], [[Surdas]], [[Swami Haridas]] and many more played pivotal role in enlighting society about goddess Radha who is believed to be the feminine form of Krishna himself.{{sfnm|1a1=Archer|1y=2004|1loc=5.3 Later Poetry|2a1=Hardy|2y=1987|2pp=387–392|3a1=Rosenstein|3y=1997|3p=|4a1=Schwartz|4y=2004|4p=49|5a1=Hawley|5y=2005|5p=}} 
According to several [[Hindu denominations]] including [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]], [[Pushtimarg]], and [[Swaminarayan Sampradaya]], it is believed that Radha is not just one cowherd maiden, but the origin of all the [[gopis]], or divine personalities that participate in the [[rasa (theology)|rasa]] dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schweig|2005|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also mentioned in [[Gopala Tapani Upanishad]], [[Chaitanya Charitamrita]] and [[Gita Govinda]].{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

==Shakti and Shaktiman==
[[File:Sri Radha Krishna at Parashakthi Temple.jpg|thumb|Shree Radha Krishna Ashta Shakthi Mandir at [[Parashakthi Temple]], Pontiac, USA]]
The common derivation of ''[[shakti]]'' and ''shaktiman'', i.e. female and male principle in a god implies that shakti and shaktiman are the same.&lt;ref&gt;Surendranath Dasgupta, A History of Indian Philosophy (1991) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Each and every god has its partner, or Shakti, and without this Shakti, is sometimes viewed being without essential power.&lt;ref&gt;Santilata Dei, Del Santilata, Vaisnavism in Orissa (1988) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; It is a not uncommon feature of [[Hinduism]] when worship of a pair rather than one personality constitutes worship of [[God]], such is worship of Radha Krishna. Traditions worshiping Krishna, as ''[[svayam bhagavan]]'', who is male, include reference and veneration to his Radha, who is worshiped as supreme. A view that exists of orthodox Krishnaism, the sect of the worship of Krishna, is that Radha is shakti and Krishna is shaktiman and are always found without any tinge of materialistic attributes or cause.&lt;ref&gt;Kakoli Basak, (1991) Rabindranath Tagore, a Humanist - p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology and philosophy==
[[File:Jayadeva bow to Radha-krishna.jpg|thumb|[[Jayadeva]] worshipping of Radha Krishna.]]
From the Vaishnava point of view the divine feminine energy (''[[shakti]]'') implies a divine source of energy, God or ''shaktiman''. "[[Sita]] relates to [[Rama]]; [[Lakshmi]] belongs to [[Narayana]]; [[Radha]] has her [[Krishna]]." As Krishna is believed to be [[svayam bhagavan|the source of all manifestations]] of [[God]], "Radha, his consort, is the original source of all ''[[shakti]]s''" or feminine manifestation of divine energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|2002|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first theologo-philosophical justification for worshiping Radha-Krishna was given by [[Nimbarkacharya]], a founder of the [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]] in 12th or 13th century CE.{{sfn|Ramnarace|2014|p=}} In accordance with the [[Sahitya Akademi]] Encyclopaedia, he more than any other acharyas gave Radha a place as a deity.{{sfn|Datta|1988|p=1415}}

A number of interpretations according to traditions possess a common root of personalism in the understanding of worship. Specifically Caitanyaite [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] doctrine and mission is fiercely "personalistic," proclaiming the supremacy of Krishna, the identification of [[Caitanya]] as Radha-Krishna, the reality and eternality of individual selves, and a method for approaching the absolute reality and the Deity as a person first and foremost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Valpey|2006|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jiva Goswami]] in his ''Priti Sandarbha'' states that each of the Gopis exhibits a different level of intensity of passion, among which Radha's is the greatest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schweig|2005|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his famous dialogs [[Ramananda Raya]] describes Radha to [[Caitanya]] and quotes, among other texts, a verse from [[Chaitanya Charitamrta]] 2.8.100, before he goes on to describe her role in the pastimes of [[Vrindavana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schweig|2005|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central pivot point of the theology is related to the word [[rasa (theology)|rasa]]. The theological use of the word can be found very early, about two thousand years before the [[Nimbarka]] or Caitanya school, in a phrase that the tradition frequently quotes: "Truly, the Lord is ''rasa''" (''raso vai sah'') of [[Brahma sutras]]. This statement expresses the view that God is the one who enjoys the ultimate rasa or spiritual rapture, emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schweig|2005|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radha Krishna are worshiped in the following [[Hindu denominations]]:
&lt;!--LISTING AS PER ALPHABETICAL ORDER, DON'T CHANGE IT WITHOUT VALID REASONS--&gt;

===Bhagavata===
{{Main|Bhagavata}}
In Vedic and [[Purana|Puran]]ic literature, Radhas and other forms of the root ''Radh'' have meaning of ‘perfection’, ‘success’ and even ‘wealth’. Lord of Success, Indra was referred to as ''Radhaspati''. In references to [[Mahavishnu]] as the Lord of Fortune and freely used by [[Jayadeva]] as ''Jaya Jayadeva Hare'' – the victorious [[Hari]], and ‘''Radhaspati''’ all found in many places. The word Radha occurs in the Atharva Veda, Taittiriya Brahmana and Taittiriya Samhita.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iskcondesiretree.com/m/blogpost?id=2103886:BlogPost:2629710|title=Lord Krishna and Rama in the Primary Vedas – ISKCON Desire Tree - Devotee Network|website=www.iskcondesiretree.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-09|archive-date=2018-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106063507/http://www.iskcondesiretree.com/m/blogpost?id=2103886:BlogPost:2629710|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlotte Vaudeville]], in the article ''Evolution of Love Symbolism in Bhagavatism'' draws some parallel to Nappinnai, appearing in Godha's magnum opus Thiruppavai and in [[Nammalwar]]'s references to Nappinnani, the daughter-in-law of Nandagopa. Nappinnai is believed to be the source of Radha's conception in [[Prakrit]] and [[Sanskrit]] literature although their characteristic relations with Krishna are different. In the ritual dance called Kuravai, Krishna dances with his wife Nappinnai. "It is a complex relationship, for the devotee is the ‘same as and yet different from’ the Lord, and so even in the joy of union there is the pain of separation. Indeed, the highest form of devotion, according to Yamunacarya, comes not in union but after the union, in the ‘fear of new separation’."&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Vaudeville, "Evolution of Love Symbolism in Bhagavatism", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' LXXXII (1962), 39&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Yashastilaka|Yasastilaka Champukavya]]'' (959 CE) all make references to Radha and Krishna well before Jayadeva's period. There are elaborate references to Radha in [[Brahma vaivarta]] and [[Padma Purana]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sankeertanam.com/saints%20texts/Jayadeva%20%26%20Gita%20Govindam_2003_SK.pdf |title=Musical Saints of India |access-date=2013-12-27 |archive-date=2017-12-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215100851/http://www.sankeertanam.com/saints%20texts/Jayadeva%20%26%20Gita%20Govindam_2003_SK.pdf |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya===
{{Main|Gaudiya Vaishnavism}}
{{See also|Manipuri Vaishnavism}}
[[Gaudiya Vaishnava]], as the name suggests, usually refers to the region of Bengal. Early [[Bengal]]i literature gives a vivid description of the depiction and evolution of understanding of Radha and Krishna.&lt;ref name=Chatterji&gt;{{cite journal |author = Chatterji, S.K. |year =1936 |title = Purana Legends and the Prakrit Tradition in New Indo-Aryan |jstor=608054 |pages = 457–466 |volume = 8 |issue = 2 |journal = Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies |doi = 10.1017/S0041977X00141096
|s2cid =162425847 }} literary study of their lyric literature of Bengal Vaishnavism, has given a useful
conspectus of the "Historical Development of the Radha-Krishna Legend"&lt;/ref&gt;

In this Bengali tradition metaphysical status and Radha-worship is considered to be established by Krsnadasa in his [[Chaitanya Charitamrta]] where he represents the doctrine that prevailed among the [[Vrindavan]] Caitanyaites following Caitanya's demise in 1533. It is believed that Krishna, desiring to experience fully what it is like to love Krishna as Radha does, has appeared as [[Caitanya Mahaprabhu]]. And what Radha (appearing as [[Caitanya]]) does in her longing for Krishna is to chant his names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Valpey|2006|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the self manifested Deities established by [[Gopala Bhatta Goswami]] is called [[Radha Ramana]], it is not surprising that Radha Ramana is seen as not only Krishna but also as Radha-Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Valpey|2006|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; And worship in his temple, located in the centre of [[Vrindavana]] is a perpetual daily affair, involving several prescribed events throughout the day,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Valpey|2006|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of being theoretical and remote, but with aspiration of the possibility to attend and associate directly with Radha and Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Valpey|2006|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Manipuri Vaishnavism]] is a regional variant of Gaudiya Vaishnavism with a culture-forming role among the [[Meitei people]] in the north-eastern Indian state of [[Manipur]].{{sfn|Singh|2004|pp=125–132}} There, after a short period of [[Ramanandi Sampradaya|Ramaism]] penetration, Gaudiya Vaishnavism spread in the early 18th century, especially from beginning its second quarter. Raja [[Gharib Nawaz (Manipur)|Gharib Nawaz (Pamheiba)]] under the influence of [[Narottama Dasa|Natottama Thakura]]'s disciples was initiated into the Chaitanya tradition with worship of Radha-Krishna as the supreme deity.{{sfn|Singh|2004|p=128}}&lt;ref name="ML"&gt;{{cite book |author= chief ed.

===Nimbarka Sampradaya===
{{Main|Nimbarka Sampradaya}}
[[File:Shankhchakra.jpg|thumb|left|The Shankha-Chakra-Tilaka emblems of the Sri Nimbarka Sampradaya.]]
The [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]] worship the youthful form of Krishna, alone or with his consort Radha, is one of the earliest dating at least to the 12th century CE, just as [[Rudra Sampradaya]] does.&lt;ref&gt;The penny cyclopædia [ed. by G. Long]. 1843, p.390 [https://books.google.com/books?id=_8cWRilIuE0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA390&amp;dq=rudra+sampradaya&amp;as_brr=3#PRA1-PA390,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hardy|1987|pp=387–392}}{{sfn|Ramnarace|2014|p=}} According to [[Nimbarkacharya]], a founder of the sampradaya, Radha is the eternal consort of Vishnu-Krishna and there is also a suggestion, though not a clear statement, that she became the wife of her beloved Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;Sharda Arya, Sudesh Narang, ''Religion and Philosophy of the Padma-purāṇa: Dharmaśāstra.'' Miranda House (University of Delhi). Dept. of Sanskrit, India University Grants Commission, 1988. 547, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Nimbarka rescues Radha from the presumed immoral implication of much of the literature, and gives to her a dignity unattained elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Melville T. Kennedy, ''The Chaitanya Movement: A Study of the Vaishnavism of Bengal'', 1925. 270, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nimbarka Sampradaya is one of the four bona fide Vaishnavite traditions. Lack of evidence due to the destruction of Mathura and Vrindavan in the 13th century and 14th century has meant that the true dates and origins of this tradition are shrouded in mystery and await investigation.

[[File:Krishna-radha ardhanari.jpg|thumb|Radha-Krishna [[ardhanari]]—depicted as half-male and half-female]]

Nimbarka, who is widely held by scholars such as Satyanand Joseph, Prof. Rasik Bihari Joshi, Prof. M. M. Aggrawal etc., to be at least of the same time or before the appearance of [[Shankaracharya]], was the first acharya to worship Radha along with Krishna in Sakhi Bhava Upasana method of worship.{{sfn|Datta|1988|p=1415}} In his ''Vedanta Kamadhenu Dashashloki'' (verse 6), it is clearly stated that:
{{Verse translation
|ange tu vaame vrishabhaanujaam mudaa viraajamaanaam anuruupasaubhagaam.
sakhiisahasraih parisevitaam sadaa smarema deviim sakalestakaamadaam
|The left portion of the body of the Supreme Lord is Shrimati Radha, seated blissfully, as beautiful as the Lord Himself; who is served by thousands of gopis: we meditate on the Supreme Goddess, the fulfiller of all desires.}}

This theme was taken up by [[Jayadeva]] Goswami and other poets of the time who saw the inherent beauty and bliss which constitute this philosophy.{{sfn|Datta|1988|pp=1414–1423}} In his [[Gita Govinda]] Krishna speaks to Radha:
{{blockquote|&lt;poem&gt;
O woman with desire, place on this patch of flower-strewn floor your lotus foot,
And let your foot through beauty win,
To me who am the Lord of All, O be attached, now always yours.
O follow me, my little Radha.
&lt;/poem&gt;|sign=Jayadeva|source=''Gita Govinda''{{sfn|Archer|2004|loc=5.2 The Gita Govinda}}}}

It is believed, however, that the source of Jayadeva's heroine in his poem remains a puzzle of the Sanskrit Literature. At the same time there are well documented references to works earlier than Gita Govinda, which some count to be more than twenty. The figure of Radha is one of the most elusive in the literature of Sanskrit; she is described only in a few selected passages of Prakrit or Sanskrit poetry, a few inscriptions and a few works on grammar, poetry and drama. Jayadeva has referred to them and created an exquisite lyrical poem of passionate devotion in the 12th century CE, and from this poetic beginning a huge movement specific to Bengal began.{{sfn|Miller|1975|pp=655–671}}{{sfn|Love Song of the Dark Lord: Jayadeva's Gītagovinda|1977}}

[[File:Krishna and Radha looking into a mirror. - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Radha Krishna looking into the mirror (1800 CE painting)]]

In this sampradaya, the significance of Radha is not less than the significance of Sri Krsna. Both are conjointly the object to be worshiped in this school of Nimbarka,&lt;ref&gt;Ramesh M. Dave, K. K. A. Venkatachari, ''The Bhakta-bhagawan Relationship: Paramabhakta Parmeshwara Sambandha''. Sya. Go Mudgala, Bochasanvasi Shri Aksharpurushottama Sanstha, 1988. p.74&lt;/ref&gt; who is also one of the first commentators on [[Brahma Sutras]] under the name ''Vedanta-Parijata-Saurabha''. The later [[acharya]]s of the Nimbarka Sampradaya in the 13th and 14th centuries in [[Vrindavan]]a composed much literature on the Divine Couple. Swami Sri Sribhatta, the elder god-brother of Jayadeva composed the Yugala Shataka for the Dhrupada style of musical presentation like Jayadeva, however unlike Jayadeva who composed his work in [[Sanskrit]], Swami Shribhatta's compositions are in Vraja language, a [[Hindi]] vernacular which was understood by all inhabitants of [[Vraja]]. Indeed, the rest of the acharyas of this tradition wrote in Vraja language and due to the lack of prevalence of this language in modern times, very little research has been done, even though these Acharyas predate the [[Six Goswamis]] of Vrindavan by centuries. Rare exception was Vijay Ramnarace's PhD thesis in 2014.{{sfn|Ramnarace|2014|p=}}

In any case, the sole object of worship in the Nimbarka Sampradaya is the unified Divine Couple of Shri Radha Krishna. According to the 15th century Mahavani written by Jagadguru Swami Sri Harivyasa Devacharya -

''"radhaamkrsnasvaroopaam vai, krishnam raadhaasvarupinam; kalaatmaanam nikunjastham gururoopam sadaa bhaje"''

which means "I ceaselessly praise Radha who is none other than Krishna, and Sri Krishna who is none other than Radha, whose unity is represented by the Kaamabeeja and who are forever resident in Nikunja [[Goloka]] Vrindavana."{{sfn|Ramnarace|2014|p=}}

The contribution from the [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]] to the philosophy of Radha Krishna is undeniable, as the philosophy and theology originate in it.

===Pranami Sampradaya===
{{Main|Pranami}}
The [[Pranami|Pranami Sampradaya]] (Pranami Panth) emerged in the 17th century in [[Gujarat]], based on the Radha-Krishna-focussed syncretic Hindu-[[Islam]]ic teachings of Devchandra Maharaj and his famous successor, Mahamati Prannath.{{sfn|Toffin|2012|pp=249–254}}

===Pushtimarg Sampradaya===
{{Main|Pushtimarg}}
[[Vallabha]]charya, founder of [[Pushtimarg]] tradition even before Chaitanya, worshipped Radha, where according to some sects, the devotees identify mainly with the female companion (''sakhis'') of Radha who are privileged to arrange intimate pastimes for RadhaKrishna.&lt;ref name=White1990&gt;{{cite journal

One of the prominent poets of this tradition, which also called Radhavallabhi, named Dhruvadasa was notable for being principally concerned with the private relationships of Radha and Krishna. In his poetry ''Caurasi Pad'' and in the commentaries of his followers, the concentration is in meditation on the unique benefits of constant reflection on the [[lila (Hinduism)|eternal lila]].

Radhavallabhis share with their Vaishnava co-religionists a great regard for [[Bhagavata Purana]], but some of the pastimes that are outside the scope of relationships with Radha and [[gopis]] do not feature in the concept of this school. Emphasis is placed on the sweetness of the relationship, or [[rasa (theology)|rasa]].&lt;ref name=Snell1992&gt;{{cite book

===Radha Vallabh Sampradaya===
{{Main|Radha Vallabh Sampradaya}}

The Radha-centered [[Radha Vallabh Sampradaya]] founded by [[Hith Harivansh Mahaprabhu]] in the 16th century occupies a special position among other traditions. In its theology, Radha is worshiped as the supreme deity, and Krishna is in a subordinate position.{{sfnm|1a1=White|1y=1977|1p=|2a1=Snell|2y=1991|2loc=chapter 1|3a1=Rosenstein|3y=1998|3p= |4a1=Beck|4y=2005|4p=}}

===Swaminarayan Sampradaya===
Radha-Krishna Dev has a special place in the [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]] as [[Swaminarayan]] himself referred to Radha Krishna in the [[Shikshapatri]] he wrote.&lt;ref name="swaminarayan.nu"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.swaminarayan.nu/sampraday/shiksha.shtml | title =Shikshapatri, verse 109 by Swaminarayan | access-date =2008-05-15 | archive-date =2012-02-10 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120210201259/http://www.swaminarayan.nu/sampraday/shiksha.shtml | url-status =live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he himself ordered the construction of temples in which Radha Krishna have been installed as deities. Swaminarayan "explained that Krishna appears in many forms. When he is together with Radha, he is regarded as supreme lord under the name of Radha-Krishna; with Rukmini he is known as [[Lakshminarayan|Lakshmi-Narayana]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first temple constructed in the sect, built in [[Ahmedabad]] in 1822, houses the images of [[Nara Narayana]], forms of [[Arjuna]] and Krishna, in the central shrine. The shrine on the left of the hall has [[murti]]s of Radha Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the philosophy of the tradition there were many female companions of Krishna, [[gopi]]s, but out of all of them Radha was considered to be the perfect devotee. Those who wish to come close to Krishna must cultivate the devotional qualities of Radha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to theory the sect has set aside [[Goloka]] as the supreme heaven or abode (in fact, in some of their temples, such as the [[Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Mumbai|Mumbai Temple]], the murtis installed are those of Shri Gaulokvihari and Radhikaji), because there Krishna is supposed to be enjoying himself with his Gopis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; who according to the Swaminarayana sampradaya the milkmaids with whom Krishna danced; his relations with them symbolize the relation of God with the devotee in reciprocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2001|loc=back matter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Vaishnava-Sahajiya}}
Since the 15th century CE in Bengal and [[Assam]] flourished [[Tantra|Tantric]] [[Vaishnava-Sahajiya]] tradition inspired by Bengali spiritual poet [[Chandidas]], where Krishna is the inner divine aspect of man and Radha is the aspect of woman.{{sfn|Basu|1932}}{{sfn|Hayes|2005|pp=19–32}}

The date of Chandidas poem ''Srikrsnakirtana'' is still under question however the text remains one of the most important evidences of early portrayal of the popular story of "Lord Krishna's love for the cowherd girl [[Radha]]" in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] literature and religion. The 412 songs of ''Srikrsnakirtana'' are divided into thirteen sections that represent the core of the Radha-Krishna legendary cycle,
with many variants providing excellent comparative material. The manuscript clearly suggests that the songs were meant to be song, and implies particular ''[[raga]]s'' for the recitation. There is considerable debate as to the authenticity of the text that has significant religious meaning.&lt;ref name=Stewart1986&gt;{{cite journal

=== Warkari Tradition ===
In [[Warkari]] tradition which is majorly based in the region of [[Maharashtra]], Radha and Krishna are often venerated in their regional forms of [[Rahi (goddess)|Rahi]] and [[Vithoba]], also called Vithala.

In opinion of some Hindu scholars as well as scholars of [[Hinduism]], a [[golden age]] existed when [[Muslim]]s and Hindus created a common culture mainly because some Muslim rulers patronized [[Sanskrit]] and translations from Sanskrit into [[Persian language|Persian]], while there were Muslim poets who criticised Hinduism and personal form of Radha-Krishna.&lt;ref name = S1992&gt;{{cite book

== Development ==
The earliest appearance of the "[[Mother goddess|Mother Goddess]]" found in [[South Asia]] is in [[Mehrgarh]] in the form of female [[terracotta]] figurines dating to the [[4th millennium BCE]]. These figurines are believed to represent the "Mother Goddess." Similar female figurines are found in 3rd-2nd millennium figures from [[Harappan civilization]] sites, including a woman with a plant emerging from her womb and a woman in a tree (believed to be a goddess) being worshipped by another woman, with seven figures below. Due to their association with agriculture, the idea of the earth spirit of ''bhumi'' is still a common association with villages today just as it was in Harappan times. Evidence of continued veneration of a female village deity comes from a terracotta fragment Chandraketugarh from what is now eastern West Bengal dating to the [[1st century BCE]]. The plaque shows a figure holding a parasol, evidently a goddess, being worshipped with earthen pots, fruits, flowers and other offerings similar to those given to modern-day village goddesses. Another group of common iconography related to gramadevatas are the ''[[Saptamatrika|sapta matrika]]'', the "seven mothers." The first mention of these goddesses occurs in the later layers of the [[Mahabharata]] dating to the 1st century CE, and their lack of mention in [[the Vedas]] indicates a non-Vedic origin for these goddesses.&lt;ref name="ELGO" /&gt; In addition to the fertility goddesses, the various disease goddesses include deities described with unappealing physical characteristics like [[Mariamman]] and Mata. These goddesses could be represented in the Harappan period by a goddess with weapons in her hair. Similarly, goddesses absorbed into [[Puranic Hinduism]], like [[Durga]], appear around the 1st century BCE-1st century CE.&lt;ref name="ELGO"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Elgood |first=Heather |date=2004-09-01 |title=Exploring the roots of village Hinduism in South Asia |journal=World Archaeology|volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=326–342 |doi=10.1080/0043824042000282777 |s2cid=144268377 |issn=0043-8243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend ==
A South Indian legend states that the gramadevatas trace their origin to the first [[Shakti]], created by the [[Brahman|Supreme Being]]. Nine forms of this Shakti, collectively designated as the Navashakti, were created. Due to their arrogance, they were banished from [[Svarga|heaven]] to the earth, where they were assigned the task of protecting mankind from evil and malicious forces. Thus, the gramadevatas are honoured for their duty through festivals and temples dedicated to their worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Garrett |first=John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6paBoEtkUt0C&amp;dq=gramadevata+banished&amp;pg=PA540 |title=A Classical Dictionary of India |year=1971 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distri |pages=540 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sharma |first=Arvind |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gDmUToaeMJ0C&amp;dq=gramadevata+hinduism&amp;pg=PA65 |title=Classical Hindu Thought: An Introduction |date=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-564441-8 |pages=65 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gramadevatas often share common suffixes in their names, such as ''amman'' or ''amma'', the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] root word for mother, or ''ai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=J.N.K |first=Mugambi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cx8ACQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=gramadevata+dravidian&amp;pg=PA71 |title=A Comparative Study of Religions: Second Edition |date=2015-03-16 |publisher=University of Nairobi Press |isbn=978-9966-846-89-1 |pages=71 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Veneration ==
Gramadevatas are believed to serve as the protectors of fields and the general countryside, preventing plagues, famines, pestilence, war, as well as natural disasters. They are also venerated to honour their task of guarding villagers from evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Jeyaraj |first=Daniel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=loF_AgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=male+gramadevata&amp;pg=PA114 |title=Genealogy of the South Indian Deities: An English Translation of Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg's Original German Manuscript with a Textual Analysis and Glossary |date=2004-09-23 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-28703-1 |pages=114 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deities, predominantly goddesses, possess both benevolent and malevolent features, to mark their roles as gentle to supplicants, and also fierce to wrongdoers. They are associated with agriculture, harvests, rain, and are regarded to be embodiments of fertility. These deities are often venerated in the open fields, or in the form of shrines. Most of them are not accompanied by a male consort. Their shrines could sometimes be composed of a pile of stones or a flag. While some of these shrines are maintained and served by priests, others merely have a keeper who is not accorded a special status. Animal sacrifices and blood are often served as offerings to placate these goddesses by their devotees, including chickens, goats, and occasionally buffaloes, traditionally requiring them to be male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Elgood |first=Heather |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAcF8RgbtZ0C&amp;dq=gramadevata+fertility+guardian&amp;pg=PA68 |title=Hinduism and the Religious Arts |date=2000-04-01 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-0-8264-9865-6 |pages=68 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Blurton |first=T.

=== Syncretism ===
While various gramadevatas possess discrete worlds and forms of worship from mainstream Hinduism, others have been syncretised as members of the greater pantheon of [[Hindu deities]]. For instance, the deity [[Venkateswara|Venkateshvara]], a form of [[Vishnu]], is regarded by local adherents to be the brother of Gangamma, a gramadevata. Mainstream Hindu deities and gramadevatas are often ritually worshipped together due to their integrated traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Flueckiger |first=Joyce Burkhalter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=44MTBwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=gramadevata+hinduism&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Everyday Hinduism |date=2015-02-23 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-118-52818-1 |pages=34 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the prevalence of [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaivism]], it is common to find representations of male gramadevatas as forms of [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Coulter |first1=Charles Russell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QEJUEAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=gramadevata+vishnu&amp;pg=PA196 |title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities |last2=Turner |first2=Patricia |date=2021-12-06 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-9179-7 |pages=196 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and female gramadevatas as forms of [[Lakshmi]] and [[Parvati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kelly |first=Frank Bolger |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=85QWBv-PlpcC&amp;dq=gramadevata+vishnu+shiva&amp;pg=PA647 |title=Scoffing at Scripture: A Commoner Reads the World's Holy Writ and Rejects Traditional Religion |date=February 2011 |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |isbn=978-1-60844-808-1 |pages=647 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few gramadevatas, such as [[Ganesha]], have been completely adopted into [[Puranas|Puranic]] Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Jain |first=Sandhya |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NDBlEAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=gramadevata+parvati&amp;pg=PT138 |title=Adi Deo Arya Devata: A Panoramic View oF Tribal-Hindu Cultural Interface |date=2022-03-19 |publisher=Notion Press |isbn=979-8-88530-378-1 |pages=138 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Yama's Court and Hell.jpg|thumb|Yama's court.|260x260px]]
'''Mṛtyu''' ({{lang-sa|मृत्यु|lit=Death|translit=Mṛtyu}}), is a [[Sanskrit]] word meaning [[death]]. Mṛtyu, or Death, is often [[Death (personification)|personified as]] the deities ''Mara'' (मर) and ''[[Yama]]'' (यम) in [[Dharmic religions]] such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]].
* [[Mara (Hindu goddess)]], the goddess of death according to [[Hindu mythology]].
*'''Mṛtyu-māra''' as death in Buddhism or [[Mara (demon)|Māra]], a "demon" of the Buddhist cosmology, the personification of Temptation.
*'''[[Yama]]''' ({{lang-sa|यम}}) is the god of death and the underworld in Hinduism and Buddhism.
**[[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]] in Hinduism.
**[[Yama (East Asia)|Yama]] in Buddhism.

==Etymology==
The Vedic ''mṛtyú'', along with [[Avestan]] ''mərəθiiu'' and [[Old Persian]] ''məršiyu'' comes from the Proto-Indo-Iranian word for death, ''*mr̥tyú-'', which is ultimately derived from the Indo-European root ''*mer-'' ("to die") and thus is further related to [[Latin]] ''mors''.

==Literature==

=== Vedas ===
Mrtyu is invoked in the hymns of the [[Rigveda]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2021-08-27 |title=Rig Veda 10.18.1 [English translation] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/rig-veda-english-translation/d/doc838689.html |access-date=2022-11-04 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Blockquote|text=Depart, Mṛtyu, by a different path; by that which is your own, and distinct from the path of the gods; Ispeak to you who have eyes, who have ears; do no harm to our offspring, nor to our male progeny.|title=[[Rigveda]]|source=Hymn 10.18.1}}

=== Upanishads ===
The [[Brhadaranyaka Upanishad]] (a mystical appendix to the [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] and likely the oldest of the Upanishads) has a [[creation myth]] where ''{{IAST|Mṛtyu}}'' "Death" takes the shape of a horse, and includes an identification of the [[Ashvamedha]] horse sacrifice with the Sun:&lt;ref&gt;implicitly, in ''{{IAST|eṣa vā aśvamedho ya eṣa tapati}}'' "verily, that Ashvamedha is that which gives out heat [''tap-'']"&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{Blockquote|text=Then he became a horse (ashva), because it swelled (ashvat), and was fit for sacrifice (medhya); and this is why the horse-sacrifice is called Ashva-medha [...] Therefore the sacrificers offered up the purified horse belonging to Prajapati, (as dedicated) to all the deities. Verily the shining sun [ye tapati] is the Asvamedha, and his body is the year; Agni is the sacrificial fire (arka), and these worlds are his bodies. These two are the sacrificial fire and the Asvamedha-sacrifice, and they are again one deity, viz. Death.|title=[[Brhadaranyaka Upanishad]]|source=Hymn 1.2.7}}

=== Padma Purana ===
Mrtyu fights in the war between the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] and the [[Asura|asuras]] in the legend of [[Jalandhara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2019-09-26 |title=War Between Gods and Demons [Chapter 5] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-padma-purana/d/doc365436.html |access-date=2022-11-04 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mahabharata ===
The [[Mahabharata]] references a legend regarding a dispute between [[Time in Hindu mythology|Time]], Mrityu, Yama, [[Ikshvaku]], and a [[Brahmin|Brahmana]]. Mrityu is female in this legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=www.wisdomlib.org |date=2021-08-17 |title=Section CXCIX [Mahabharata, English] |url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-mahabharata-mohan/d/doc826157.html |access-date=2022-11-04 |website=www.wisdomlib.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Temblai Devi''' or '''Tryamboli''' (as known locally) is form of Renuka devi, an incarnation of Goddess [[Durga]] and the presiding deity of temple located on a hilltop in the eastern part of [[Kolhapur]], [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].

On account of the temple, the hillock on which the temple is located is known as Temblai hill. The temple complex has two temples, the bigger temple on the southern end is Temblai devi while the one on the north eastern side is a smaller one dedicated to Yamai devi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kolhapurworld.in/2015/temblai-temple/|title=Temblai Temple Kolhapur World|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location is flanked on the northern side by a road and the southern side by the territorial army quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tembalai+Mandir/@16.6981577,74.2587754,17z/data=!4m21!1m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x3bc10034374a61b5:0x1c15328c1b7e0405!2m2!1d74.2600779!2d16.6980531!1m6!1m2!1s0x3bc10034374a61b5:0x1c15328c1b7e0405!2sTembalai+Mandir,+Vikramnagar,+Kolhapur,+Maharashtra+416005!2m2!1d74.2600779!2d16.6980531!3e0!3m4!1s0x3bc10034374a61b5:0x1c15328c1b7e0405!8m2!3d16.6980531!4d74.2600779|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps|language=en|access-date=2019-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devotees, especially women visit the temple and pray to marry a man of their choice or if married, wish and pray for the long and healthy life of their husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ishtadevata.com/temple/temblai-hill-temple-kolhapur-kolhapur/|title=Temblai Hill Temple|website=Hindu Temple Timings, History, Location, Deity, shlokas|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a well known local tourist spot for visitors and locals. The Temblai temple complex has been recognized as one of the many places to visit for tourists coming to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Travel|first=Travel India|title=11 Best Places To Visit in Kolhapur|url=https://www.travelindiatravel.in/best-places-to-visit-in-kolhapur/|access-date=2020-08-11|website=Travel India Travel|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exists another temple of Temblai devi near the Panchganga river at Kadamwadi a short distance away from this grand temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kolhapurcorporation.gov.in/Rankala/rankala_mahotsav_at_%20a_glance.htm|title=Rankala Mahotsav...|website=kolhapurcorporation.gov.in|access-date=2019-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple complex has a large idol of [[Ganesha|Ganpati]] in the open plateau section on the north eastern side of the temple. Next to the Ganpati idol is a small commemorative bust statue of [[Shivaji|Chhatrapati Shivaji]] built by the Devasthan committee. The local authorities have developed this area with a small children's park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kolhapurworld.in/2015/temblai-temple/|title=Temblai Temple Kolhapur World|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pre-independence era, the hillock was a centre for treating tuberculosis patients on account of fresh air winds blowing in over the hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esakal.com/paschim-maharashtra/temblai-hill-cleanliness-campaign-kolhapur-sakal-event-172444|title=कुठे हरवली मूळ त्र्यंबोली टेकडी? {{!}} eSakal|website=www.esakal.com|language=mr|access-date=2019-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another relatively lesser known temple of Goddess Temblai is located in the city on the banks of Panchaganga river at Kadamwadi on the north eastern side of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kolhapurcorporation.gov.in/Rankala/rankala_mahotsav_at_%20a_glance.htm|title=Rankala Mahotsav...|website=kolhapurcorporation.gov.in|access-date=2019-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend ==
[[File:Temblai Ganpati.jpg|alt=Ganesha statue at the Temblai hill temple complex|thumb|Ganesha statue at the Temblai hill temple complex]]
Local legends say that Goddess Renuka is the sister of Mahalaxmi and she actively supported Mahalaxmi in her endeavours to slay the demons in the region. However, after the wars Mahalaxmi did not accord her due respect to Goddess Renuka and she came down to the hill and sat there with her back towards Mahalaxmi. This is the reason why the idol of Mahalaxmi at her temple faces the west and that of the Goddess Renuka at Temblai faces the east. Every year during Navratri there is a procession that celebrates the reconciliation of the two sisters on the fifth day of Lalitpanchami.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/traveller/ot-getaway-guides/kolhapur-modern-temple-town/|title=Kolhapur: Modern Temple Town|website=Outlook Traveller|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/traveller/ot-getaway-guides/kolhapur-modern-temple-town/|title=Kolhapur: Modern Temple Town|website=Outlook Traveller|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the month of ''Shravan'', pilgrims flock to the temple for the annual pilgrimage known as Temblai yatra (''jatra'') where people from far off areas of Kolhapur and Belgaum district arrive to worship the Goddess.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} Every year during [[Navaratri|Navratri]], on the fifth day of Lalitapanchami, a palkhi procession is taken from the [[Mahalaxmi Kolhapur|Mahalaxmi]] temple to Temblai mandir at Temblai hill. As of 2013, over 1 million devotees visited the temple during Navratri festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/Temblai-temple-abuzz-on-fifth-day-of-Navaratra/articleshow/23836752.cms|title=Temblai temple abuzz on fifth day of Navaratra - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2019-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local dialects use a common salutation to the Goddess ''Tembali chya navane chang bhala,'' this has extensively been used in ''sholkas'' and ''bhajans'' that devotees sing and play during the annual pilgrimage and other times at their homes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ormp3.org/fabcde/temblai-chya-navan-changbhal.html ''Song dedicated to Goddess Temblai'']&lt;/ref&gt; During the festival special arrangements are made by the administration to manage traffic and diversions for the convenience of the devotees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/Police-to-divert-traffic-for-yatra-to-Tremboli-Traffic-diversion-for-Tremboli-yatra/articleshow/54670018.cms|title=tremboli: Police to divert traffic for yatra to Tremboli Traffic diversion for Tremboli yatra {{!}} Kolhapur News - Times of India|last1=Oct 4|first1=TNN {{!}} Updated|last2=2016|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2019-08-30|last3=Ist|first3=10:39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The royal family of Shahu II had special regard for the Temblai fair as people had a special importance for his presence during the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.63251|title=Shri Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaja Of Kolhapur Vol I|last=Latthe A.b|date=1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legend from the ''Karvir Puran'' states that Temblai, the younger sister of Mahalaxmi, left the city of Kolhapur 1800 years ago and came over to the hillock three miles from the city and remained there with her back to her elder sister at [[Mahalakshmi Temple, Kolhapur|Mahalaxmi temple]]. Every year in the month of ''Ashvin'', on the fifth day of the bright moon, the elder sister Mahalaxmi visits her younger sister at Temblai. The festival is now celebrated as traditional event where a procession is carried out with Mahalaxmi placed in a palkhi and followed by a young unmarried girl cutting a pumpkin to commemorate the killing of the demon ''Kolhasur'' by Mahalaxmi [[Ambabai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|agency=TNN|date=Oct 11, 2021|title=Mahalaxmi's procession to Temblai hill without devotees {{!}} Kolhapur News - Times of India|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/mahalaxmis-procession-to-temblai-hill-without-devotees/articleshow/86917447.cms|access-date=2021-12-13|website=The Times of India|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temblai hill hosts a fair in the temple complex that has 15000–20000 pilgrims.

The royal family of the Maratha empire had also been actively participating in the temple celebrations.

== Temblai locality and the army ==
The Temblai area is a formation of three hillocks, one of which has the Renuka devi temple complex. The second one has a water tank built over it. The third one on the opposite side of the road was donated by the royal family of Chhatrapati of Kolhapur in the 1950s for utilization by the Indian army territorial army contingent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/Soldiers-to-salute-Kolhapurs-royal-family/articleshow/35921037.cms|title=Soldiers to salute Kolhapur's royal family {{!}} Kolhapur News - Times of India|last1=Jun 2|first1=Samrat Phadnis {{!}} TNN {{!}}|last2=2014|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2020-01-28|last3=Ist|first3=4:42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this the hillock was the headquarter and barrack of the royal army called Rajaram rifles (that later merged with Maratha regiment in 1951) that was under Chattrapati's command during colonial times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/Soldiers-to-salute-Kolhapurs-royal-family/articleshow/35921037.cms|title=Soldiers to salute Kolhapur's royal family {{!}} Kolhapur News - Times of India|last1=Jun 2|first1=Samrat Phadnis {{!}} TNN {{!}}|last2=2014|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2020-01-28|last3=Ist|first3=4:42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2018, an event exhibition was organized for citizens by the [[Territorial Army (India)|territorial army]] to commemorate the armed forces flag day.

The '''visvedevas''' ({{Lang-sa|विश्वेदेव|translit=Viśvēdēva}}) refers to the designation used to address the entirety of the various deities featured in the [[Vedas]]. It also refers to a specific classification of deities in the [[Puranas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kulasrestha |first=Mahendra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OIoRWGSfMikC&amp;newbks=0&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=Vishvedevas&amp;hl=en |title=The Golden Book of Rigveda |date=2006 |publisher=Lotus Press |isbn=978-81-8382-010-3 |pages=87 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visvedevas are sometimes regarded as the most comprehensive gathering of the gods, a classification in which no deity is stated to be omitted.&lt;ref&gt;Renou, Louis. ''L'Inde Classique'', vol. 1, p. 328, Librairie d'Ameriqe et d'Orient.  Paris 1947, reprinted 1985. {{ISBN|2-7200-1035-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==

=== Rigveda ===
In the [[Rigveda]] a number of hymns are addressed  to these deities, including (according to [[Ralph T. H. Griffith|Griffith]]): 1.3,1.89,3.54-56, 4.55, 5.41-51, 6.49-52, 7.34-37, 39, 40, 42, 43, 8.27-30, 58, 83 10.31, 35, 36, 56, 57, 61-66, 92, 93, 100, 101, 109, 114, 126, 128, 137, 141, 157, 165, 181.

[[Mandala 3|RV 3]].54.17 addresses them as headed by [[Indra]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Griffith |first=Ralph Thomas Hotchkin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ot7NfhBy148C&amp;newbks=0&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=This+is,+ye+Wise,+your+great+and+glorious+title,+that+all+ye+Deities+abide+in+Indra.&amp;hl=en |title=The Hymns of the Ṛgveda |last2=Shastri |first2=Jagdish Lal |date=1973 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=978-81-208-0046-5 |pages=192 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''This is, ye Wise, your great and glorious title, that all ye Deities abide in Indra.'' (trans. Griffith)

The dichotomy between [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] is not evident in these hymns, and the devas are invoked together such as [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]] and [[Varuna]]. Though many devas are named in the Rigveda, only [[Thirty-three gods|33 devas]] are counted, eleven of them present each in earth, space, and [[Svarga|heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;Singhal, K. C; Gupta, Roshan. The Ancient History of India, Vedic Period: A New Interpretation. Atlantic Publishers and Distributors. {{ISBN|8126902868}}. P. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Manusmriti ===
According to [[Manu Smriti|Manu]] (iii, 90, 121), offerings should be made daily to the visvedevas.  These privileges were bestowed on them by [[Brahma]] and the [[Pitri]] as a reward for severe austerities they had performed on the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams.  ''A Sanskrit-English Dictionary'', p.993, Bay Foreign Language Books, Ashford, Kent. 1899, reprinted 2003.  {{ISBN|1-873722-09-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Puranas ===
In later [[Hinduism]], the visvedevas form one of the nine ganadevatas (along with the [[adityas]], [[vasus]], [[Tushita|tushitas]], [[abhasvaras]], anilas, [[maharajikas]], [[sadhyas]], and [[rudras]]). According to the [[Vishnu Purana]] and [[Padma Purana]], they were the sons of Vishvā, a daughter of [[Daksha]], described as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Danielou |first=Alain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OIXtDwAAQBAJ&amp;newbks=0&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=PA302&amp;dq=%C4%80bh%C4%81svaras&amp;hl=en |title=The Myths and Gods of India: The Classic Work on Hindu Polytheism |date=2017-01-01 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-3638-9 |pages=302 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Kāla|Kala]] 
* Kama 
* [[Dhrti]] 
* Kuru 
* [[Pururavas]] 
* Madravas 
* Rocaka or Locana
* Dhvani or Dhuri

=== Mahabharata ===
The visvedevas are described to have incarnated on earth due to the curse of sage [[Vishwamitra|Vishvamitra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Debroy |first=Bibek |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IpwlAQAAIAAJ&amp;newbks=0&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=vishvadevas+vishwamitra&amp;q=vishvadevas+vishwamitra&amp;hl=en |title=The Holy Puranas |last2=Debroy |first2=Dipavali |date=2002 |publisher=B.R.

They are described to have returned to their original forms after being killed by [[Ashwatthama|Ashvatthama]] at night.

The '''kimpurushas''' ({{Lang-sa|किंपुरुष|translit=Kimpuruṣa}}) are a race of beings featured in [[Hindu texts|Hindu literature]]. They are described to possess the bodies of human beings and equine heads. They are associated and sometimes regarded to be the same as the [[Kinnara|kinnaras]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hudson |first=D.
